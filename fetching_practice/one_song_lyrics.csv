The Chain,Fleetwood Mac,Rumours,271,"Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
We would never break the chain (never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
We would never break the chain (never break the chain)

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
We would never break the chain (never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
We would never break the chain (never break the chain)

And if you don't love me now (you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
We would never break the chain (never break the chain)

Chain, keep us together (run in the shadows)
Chain, keep us together (running in the shadows)
Chain, keep us together (running in the shadows)
Chain, keep us together (run in the shadows)
Chain, keep us together (run in the shadows)",false
