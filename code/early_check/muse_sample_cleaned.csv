And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you, try to find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough

The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?
For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in

It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk 'round like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse

My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one could beat me",cause feel tired feel weak feel weak feel like wanna get to search try find inner strength pull shit motivation quitter matter bad wanna fall flat face collapse till collapse m spill rap long feel em till day drop ll m kill em cause m stop pen em hiphop m eminem subliminal thought m stop send em woman catch webs spin em hock venom adrenalin shot penicillin illing stop amoxicillin real criminal copkille hip hop villain minimal swap cop million pac listener come feel go to fear like show spirit god live hear lot lyric shock miracle product pop fizzing shizzle wizzle plot listen bizzle forgot slizzle fuck till roof come till light till leg not shut mouth till smoke clear high m rip shit till bone collapse till roof come till light till leg not shut mouth till smoke clear high m rip shit till bone collapse music like magic s certain feeling real spit people feel shit moment single minute spend tryna hold cause try shit run admit end cause m end wit half shit get get list here order list go reggie jayz pac biggie andre outkast jada kurupt nas industry m cause lot envy m list shit offend s walk round like nothing bother half people get fuckin problem hate know respect got presss wet dream like bobby whitney nate hit till roof come till light till leg not shut mouth till smoke clear high m rip shit till bone collapse till roof come till light till leg not shut mouth till smoke clear high m rip shit till bone collapse soon verse start eat mcs heart think smart absurd people hang word ill probably prop feel deserve ill serve spot forever reserve leave earth death cause heart heart know bad s m clever verse thought sporadic act like m addict rap like m addicted smack like m kim mather not wanna forth constant battle fact sit bomb rapper like blow attack m launch em track battle rap want static cause not think fact m slim matter plaque platinum status wack m badd till roof come till light till leg not shut mouth till smoke clear high m rip shit till bone collapse till roof come till light till leg not shut mouth till smoke clear high m rip shit till bone collapse roof roof roof come roof come leg leg underneath fall stand tall feel like beat

Don't be tree trunk, don't fall on my living roots
I've been humming too many words, got a weak self-esteem
That's been stomped away from every single dream
But it's something else that brought us faze
Keep it all inside, until we feel we can't unleash
I think that you made it up, I think that your mind is gone
I think you shouldn't have glorified, now you're wrong
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
They fuck with my head
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck
Suck it, bitch
You and me are here alone face flat along the edge of the glass
But I'm not here to preach, I'm just sick of thugs
My parents made me strong to lift up that glass
So why should I try, act like I'm a little pissed off
With all that shit that needs to stay back on the shelf
Because your punk ass made it up, your fucking mind was gone
Should've never glorified, now you're right
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Fucking get him out of here
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck
Suck it, bitch
You don't know me, shut up, you don't know me
Squeal like a pig when you big fucking, big fucking, ape

Well, I'll tell you about my smoke stack
What's coming back jack, we'll turn back
Curse for in their words in their words
Tell them that you fucking heard
I mean, they know that's what's coming nigga, and you're a quitter
I'm thinking 'bout something naughty and won't tell anybody
So thinking of me by now, but you go grab it
I'd like to think, for who I down this shit
I belong where they be, 'cause we can not get back those lives
We exist to cease, understand
That God hates blacks shades and all the players
Mr. P.I.G., could I fucking see?
Sure already done crushed all of my brothers dignity
And to the jury, can't be no turn is all, my skin looks colored
Does that mean I'm burnt
'Cause your punk ass made it up, your fucking mind was gone
Should've never glorified, wrong
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, sucking
They fuck with my head
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck
Suck you, bitch

You want the badge of honor when you save my hide

If you need my shame to reclaim your pride

And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists
I never did anything to you, man
No matter what I try, you'll beat me with your bitter lies

So call me crazy, hold me down
Make me cry, get off now, baby
It won't be long 'til you'll be lying limp in your own hands

You feed the beast I have within me
You wave the red flag, baby
You make it run, run, run
Standing on the sidelines, waving and grinning
You fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun
