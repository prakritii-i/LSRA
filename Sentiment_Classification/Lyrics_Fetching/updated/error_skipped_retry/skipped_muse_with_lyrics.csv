Caught in between ten and 20
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are

I'm 22 for a moment

And we're on fire
Making our way back from Mars

15, there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose
15, there's never a wish better than this
When you've only got a hundred years to live

I'm 33 for a moment
I'm still the man, but you see I'm a ""they""
A kid on the way, babe
A family on my mind

I'm 45 for a moment
The sea is high
And I'm heading into a crisis
Chasing the years of my life

15, there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose yourself within a morning star
15, I'm alright with you
15, there's never a wish better than this
When you've only got a hundred years to live

Half time goes by, suddenly you're wise
Another blink of an eye, 67 is gone
The sun is getting high
We're moving on

I'm 99 for a moment
And dying for just another moment
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are

100 years,mason proper,Already processed,"Why do we all grow old?
Why do we buy the seeds of elderly?
I want to break that mold
Fuck aging gracefully, I'm gonna be

kicking and screaming and always dreaming
about tomorrow's fun.
And even after 100 years I'll never feel quite done.

Why even write a will?
'Cause we will never die if we don't
resign to a life fulfilled.
Can't you at least find one space in yourself

that's not been filled, you can't be killed yet
because your book's not done.
And even after 100 years I'll never feel quite done.

Don't live a double life,
shoot many multiples above two.

Oh, we found a greenhouse blown to smithereens
""What a scene,"" said a dark traveling companion
(Kicking, screaming, always dreaming)

That's when I noticed my shadow seemed to have gone missing again
and my best new friend was smiling
I could see every tooth in him

That's when I noticed the foolishness that I'd been harping upon
been going on and on and on

An dem niemand mich rief

Kam ein Freund in mein Zimmer
In dem ich schon schlief

Er nahm meine Hand
Er war mir bekannt
Seine Stimme war naturgemäß tief

In den Bäumen und in den Sträuchern
Regt sich ein Windhauch und bläst in mein Ohr
Heute bin ich glücklich wie niemals zuvor

Wir hatten was zu reden
Wie er so vor mir steht

Vor meinem Bett in der Ecke
Langsam wurde es spät

Er nahm meine Hand
Er war mir bekannt
Ich wollte nicht daß er geht

Regt sich ein Windhauch und bläst in mein Ohr
Heute bin ich glücklich wie niemals zuvor"

Superstition is all we have left
Circle the wagons, we're under attack
We've realised there's no going back

In 1985
The civil war failed, why?
Kept hidden like scars of birth
Nature unable to soften the words

In 1985
My words they came alive
Friends were made for life
Morrissey and Mar gave me choice

Only 16 years of age, he said

23,shakira,Already processed,"Everybody needs an anchor
A little something that makes you stay
An incentive, someone to fight for
'Cause no one really needs so much space

A couple years ago I was lonely
I used to think that there was no God
But then you looked at me with your blue eyes
And my agnosticism turned into dust

How well you know me
That I don't care if the rest don't
It doesn't matter to me, no, oh
As long as you love me
As long as we still have each other

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
And I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true

Hey, do you believe?
Do you believe in destiny?
'Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23

God knows that I'm a good dancer
My feet can move to the music he plays
But there were times I asked for an answer
When he was acting in mysterious ways

And there were nights that I stayed up crying
'Cause I was certain that things wouldn't change
But then you came, and I saw you smiling
Just like an angel, so beautifully strange

And then you touched me
It's like you were made for me, oh
Like it was all meant to be, oh
And I was sure that you would love me
And that we'd always have each other

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
And I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true

Hey, do you believe?
Do you believe in destiny?
'Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23

Always thought that I was fine, but I was wrong
It was you, that one piece I was missing
And I could do without you, but it'd be no fun
I found you, and life was suddenly easy
There ain't no worries now
There ain't no feeling down

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
And I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true

Hey, do you believe?

And you don't know what you've got until it's gone
And you don't know who to love until you're lost
And you don't know how to feel until the moment's passed
I wish you'd live like you're made of glass

And we've got work in the morning

But it's nearly 5 a.m.

Is this really what we envisaged?
We won't be 21 again

And in the haze you see colors
And problems suddenly make sense

You'll be in an early grave

a dream,lou reed & john cale,Already processed,"It was a very cold clear fall night
I had a terrible dream
Billy name and brigid were playing under my stair case on the second floor about two o'clock in the morning

I woke up because amos and archie had started barking
That made me very angry because I wasn't feeling well and I told them I was very cross the real me that they just better remember what happened to sam the bad cat that was left at home and got s
Nd went pussy heaven

It was a very cold clear fall night
Some snowflakes were falling
Gee, it was so beautiful
And so I went to get my camera to take some pictures
And then I was taking the pictures
But the exposure thing wasn't right
And I was going to call fred or gerry
To find out how to get set it
I was too late
And then I remembered they were still probably at dinner
And anyway
I felt really bad and didn't want to talk to anybody
But the snowflakes were so beautiful and real looking
And I really wanted to hold them
And that's when I heard the voices
From down the hall near the stairs
So I got a flashlight
And I was scared and I went out into the hallway
There's been all kinds of troubles
Lately in the neighborhood
And someone's got to bring home the bacon and anyway
There were brigid and billy playing

And under the stair case
Was a little meadow sort of like the park at 23rd street
Where all the young kids go and play frisbee
Gee, that must be fun
Maybe we should do an article on that in the magazine
But they'll just tell me I'm stupid and it won't sell
But I'll just hold my ground this time, I mean
It's my magazine, isn't it?

So I was thinking that as the snowflakes fell
And I heard those voices having so much fun
Gee, it would be so great to have some fun
So I called billy
But either he didn't hear me or he didn't want to answer
Which was so strange
Because
Even if I don't like reunions I've always loved billy
I'm so glad he's working
I mean it's different than ondine
He keeps touring with those movies
And he doesn't even pay us and the film
I mean the film's just going to disintegrate and then what
I mean he's so normal off of drugs
I just don't get it

And then I saw john cale
He's been looking really great
He's been coming by the office to exercise with me
Ronnie said I have a muscle
But he's been really mean since he went to aa
I mean what does it mean
When you give up drinking and then you're still so mean
He says I'm being lazy but I'm not
I'm just can't find any ideas
I mean I'm just not

Let's face it
Going to get any ideas up at the office

And seeing john made me think of the velvets
And I had been thinking about them
When I was on st. marks place
Going to that new gallery those sweet new kids have opened
But the thought I was old
And then I saw the old dom
The old club where we did our first shows
It was so great
And I don't understand about that velvet's first album
I mean I did the cover
I was the producer
And I always see it repackaged
And I've never gotten a penny from it
How could that be
I should call henry
But it was good seeing john
I did a cover for him
But I did in black and white and he change it to color
It would have been worth more if he'd left it my way
But you can never tell any body anything I've leaned that

I tried calling again to billy and john
They wouldn't recognize me it was like I wasn't there
Why won't they let me in

And then I saw lou
I'm so mad at him
Lou reed got married and didn't invite me
I mean is it because he thought I'd bring too many people
I don't get it
Could have at least called
I mean he's doing so great
Why doesn't he call me?
I saw him at the mtv show
And he was one row away and he didn't even say hello
I don't get it
You know I hate lou
I really do
He won't even hire us for his videos
And I was proud of him

I was so scared today
There was blood leaking thought my shirt
From those old scars from being shot
And the corset I wear to keep my insides in was hurting
And I did three sets of fifteen pushups
And four sets of ten setups
But then my insides hurt
And I saw drops of blood on my shirt and I remember
The doctors saying I was dead
And then later they had to take blood out of my hand
'Couse they ran out or veins
But then
All this thinking was making me an old grouch
And you can't do anything anyway so
If they wouldn't let me play with them in my own dream
I was just going to have to make another
And another
And another
Gee, wouldn't it be funny if I died in this dream
Before I could make another one up

And nobody called

And nobody came"

not gonna be afraid no more
fear dont live here no more

that spirit aint here with me
God didnt put that in me
But the spirit of power and love
and oof sound mind
of sound mind

verse 1
waking up every day
thinking what im gonna pay
with the money i made
thinking what im gonna say
when the wife ask me
where the money we saved
use the loot for the gas bill
to pay the rent
more loot from the light bill i spent
dont wanna get the phone
cause it just keeps ringin

alot of things through the mail
got me thinkin i can make it
if i use more debt
get a refi on the crib
but the loan man keep sayin not yet
i rob pete make a deal with paul
prayin that pink slip dont fall
brother aint got time
too much on the grind
im gone let it go
trust God let Him know

Chorus

Seems like every day
somethin worse poppin up
on the news report

should i keep the kids home from school
should i stay away from the airport
using fear as a weapon revoke hate
everybody think the world aint a safe place
dont wanna use the phone cause it might be
shhh somebodies listening

alot of views got me all confused
and i really dont know what to think
(we got)
executives, liberals, activist, sprital, hipocrits
on the brink
one nations deadly call
results in another nations fall
people aint got time
too much on the grind
we gone let it go
trust God let Him know

Chorus

gas up through the roof
and i just bought a hummer and convertibl coupe
tryna keep a little juice in the boose
in my trunk
but the loots in use
PAJAMs working over time
keeping hope alive
keeping Moss in the ministry and public eye
but hypothetically what happens if the phone stops ringin
its my belief (not gonna be afraid no more)
of poverty (not gonna be afraid no more)
not losing sleep (not gonna be afraid no more)
of running out of money (not gonna be afraid no more)

Is it a dream like it was back in the stars
Could I be so wrong? Could I be so wrong?

Chew every word to prevent what I know
From slipping right out of my fingers
Out of control, I don't know where to go
Cause you were my map when I found you

Oh this could get lonely

My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Ooh, so right

And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love me then leave again

Looking North to the sea she finds the weather fine
She hears the steeple bells ringing through the orchard
All the way from town
She watches seagulls fly
Silver on the ocean stitching through the waves
The edges of the sky

Many people wander up the hills
From all around you
Making up your memories and thinking they have found you
They cover you with veils of wonder as if you were a bride
Young men holding violets are curious to know if you have cried
And tell you why
And ask you why
Any way you answer

Lace around the collars of the blouses of the ladies
Flowers from a Spanish friend of the family
The embroid'ry of your life holds you in
And keeps you out but you survive
Imprisoned in your bones
Behind the isinglass windows of your eyes

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone

Even now by the gate with you long hair blowing
And the colors of the day that lie along your arms
You must barter your life to make sure you are living
And the crowd that has come
You give them the colors
And the bells and wind and the dream

Will there never be a prince who rides along the sea and the mountains
Scattering the sand and foam into amethyst fountains
Riding up the hills from the beach in the long summer grass
Holding the sun in his hands and shattering the isinglass?

Day and night and day again and people come and go away forever
While the shining summer sea dances in the glass of your mirror
While you search the waves for love and your visions for a sign
The knot of tears around your throat is crystallizing into your design

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone
Come away alone... with me."

Lean toward the center divider
Feel the wind in my hair
Keep a light up in your window

Down by the chemistry building
I found a quiet place to park
And I made my way down the street toward your place
Stepping lightly in the dark
Climbed the steps up to your doorway
Like a man prepared to jump beneath a train
It's real warm outside tonight
Maybe tomorrow it rains, maybe tomorrow it rains

Inside your room we shut the window
And we turned on a fan
And we lay there together in the darkness
I can keep a secret if you can
Finishing one another's sentences
Like a pair of identical twins
Your boyfriend's out of town until Tuesday
And nobody saw me come in, nobody saw me come in

And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl
And in the end it doesn't matter at all
I don't know about the people that I read about in books
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks
I know I should be going somewhere, I just can't arrive
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive, alive

I ain't lost and I ain't searching

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash

The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match
In an oversized pack letting each one burn

Down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches, and the Buds, and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun

그래 봤자 아주 살짝 뿐이겠지

빛나는 눈 속에 숨은 Blue
비밀 잠수함은 Yellow It's you
주황색 노을도 보라색 물들고
까만 밤 위에서 둘만 있고 싶어

All Night All Night
너의 색깔로 나를 색칠해줘
All Night All Night
이 세상에 하나밖에 없게

모두 똑같은 곳을 볼 때
넌 다른 곳을 볼 줄 알지
천사가 너의 귓속에 속삭여주면
숨어있는 곳에 흰 눈 찾아내지

빛나는 눈 속에 숨은 Blue
Mellow한 따뜻한 Yellow It's you
주황색 노을도 보라색 물들고
까만 밤 위에서 둘만 있고 싶어

All Night All Night
너의 색깔로 나를 색칠해줘
All Night All Night
이 세상에 하나밖에 없게

I feel so high 너와 내 눈빛이 마주칠 때
I feel so hot 너와 내 손이 꽉 껴안을 때
목소리 Ooh- Melodic 언제나 두근거림을
불러와-와-와

All Night All Night
너의 색깔로 나를 색칠해줘
All Night All Night
이 세상에 하나밖에 없게
All Night All Night
너의 색깔로 나를 색칠해줘
All Night All Night
이 세상에 하나밖에 없게

even if i become
like a king or like the wind
never
never will death
stay away
but when he called me from above
neither voice nor word to say yes
we just quietly say yes to him

it seems to me
that you can't destroy it

am i going to spend the night with pain?

is so tiring for me
i am feeling cold inside
let me go on seeking fire
even death is better
than this useless life

a nakedness
the leader of whores
sheds the female breast
he tramples down
the vast furnace

binding and bitter

bones bound together

abiding in a place
tending into nothingness
dampness tending onto corruption
corruption

corruption
and merchants in trembling
dragged down into horror
terrible and whirling

sublime circumcision
solitude and desolation
a goatherd unto lost

grinding thin powder
withering and fading
the reaping-hook of dullness
earth thrown up

the mountains are cast out
lions trembling with fury
thy braking in my barrenness
the destroyer of days

This time I know there's no way back
Left alone, abandoned
Without any chance in tomorrow
You're gone forever
As I try to find a reason for this
Endlessly wondering why
You burned away all I was living for
Remembrances are all I still own of you
As I lie in my bed, drunk, confused
Flashes of our past passing before my eyes
Just like dying, endlessly dreaming of you
Dreaming of forgotten words and smiles
Trying to push away the need to harm myself
I feel is growing deep inside of me
I feel I will have to carve this pain upon my skin
Loneliness arises from the past
I will not bear this torment longer
As I try to hide the painful tears
Frustration increases in my soul
Reminding when I felt so high
Feeling nausea in my lungs, suffering
I try to sleep to heal this madness
But this bed now seems to be like my tomb
Now I know it's all too late to save me
I keep on dreaming of past years
I can't feel that warmth anymore
You turned my existence in a terminal disease
I know all I once called life ends today
As you disappear forever, flying far away
All emotions inside of me are dead and gone
I can't stand this silence, but now I'm alone
I'm alone
Where have you gone when I needed you?

This is the first time I did this. Whoo! But Ilove it! (laughs) I just want to take you away a minute. This song I'm about to do today is like a spiritual song, it 's a piece of my heart.
You see I'm the oldest of four-teen kids. Because I was the first one, mama said that may be king. So I went out and bought me a ring (laughs) But I found out later in life... that don't mean nothing.
Even though I come from that great big o'l family with four-teen kids. For some reason I've never felt like I had anybody by my side untill I ran to these bad, bad, players and bad, bad, listeners. You know what i'm talking about.

Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter
But without you, I give up

I can't sing a love song

Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

And I will love you, baby, always

'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind

Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
With these words of mine
To say to you 'til the end of time

That I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby, if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always

""Michigan seems like a dream to me now""
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus
Playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said ""Be careful, his bowtie is really a camera""

""Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat""
""We smoked the last one an hour ago""
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

""Kathy, I'm lost"", I said, though I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why

amnesia,k-rino,Already processed,"(K-Rino:)
I don't know where I'm at, or who I am
I'm being asked if I recognize certain places and faces, scriptures and diagrams
Evaluations, to see where my mind is
They said I'd understand in due time, but I don't know what time is
They bring a woman in, to visit me
And she descriptively begins to give to me, vivid periods of my history
I'm trying to figure out, who this could be
A mystery at all persistively, right now I don't even exist to me
She kisses me, like she been missing me
Then instantly the doctor gives her paper, with twenty words on a list to me
For hours, he tried to empower me
And out of the twenty nineteen I couldn't place, but one was jumping out at me
I don't feel crazy, I'm very sane
I'm trying to gain recollection, the doctor matches pictures up to every name
I try to concentrate to remember, but nothing comes
I overheard the doctor, tell the same lady I'm suffering from amnesia

(Hook: x2)
My world, ain't the same
Don't know who I am, I don't know my name
Can't remember my life, I can't remember my ways
Can't remember my nights, can't remember my days

(K-Rino:)
Now, they bring me to a different bed
And hook me up to a machine, that gave it thoughts when they strapped it to your head
Was I a righteous man, or a evil dude
They judge my feelings to certain words, based on how fast the needle moves
My reactions, would diversify
The words they said sparked emotion, some made me laugh and others made me cry
The needle, jumped out at a crazy pace
And when he said the word from the list that he gave me, I saw the lady's face
They brought, a young child in
Who began to shed tears, until he looked into my eyes and started smiling
Like he was happy, that he found me
Something was familiar about the feeling, when he wrapped his arms around me
Listen something is coming back, I'm reminiscing
A distant memory of me and this child, but it was somebody missing
Where was this other person at
Part of this puzzle could be deciphered, or something could bring that person back
It's no mirrors, in this room I'm at
To prove this fact they handed me a picture of myself, and I asked em who is that
I start to drag, like I'm going mad
It was something making me feel hatred, for this picture even though I had amnesia

(Hook x2)

(K-Rino:)
I tore the picture up, and then I screamed
The frustration of not knowing nothing, to nobody was just too extreme
Hopes that my memory, could be redeemed
I'm still struggling with the one word that seemed, to out shine the other nineteen
They strapped me down, like a wild man
The lady walked back in the room, with another female who held the child's hand
When I felt that presence, it calmed me
But as they swarmed me, the calm became a storm cause what they sung alarmed me
I heard the hate they spoke, with optics blurred
Telling me the reason I forgot them, and myself as I forgot the word
Right then I felt it, like a gust of wind
A voice said wake up, I heard clapping and I was on a stage with two other men
Opened my eyes, and realized G
A hypnotist had hypnotized another man, and at the same time hypnotized me
He said raise your arm, and hold it up
The other hypnotized man was the doctor, and in my hand the list was folded up
I opened it, wondering what can it be
It was the nineteen words from the fantasy, the list consists of friends and family
Yeah my mother wife and son, is who those people was
And the one word from the list, that seemed to stand out was the word love
Yeah, suppressed in my sub-conscience mind
Amnesia in this case is when love is in you, but you forget to show it all the time
Now back to normal, he's converting me
Said I wouldn't recall a thing, went back to my seat
and told Dope I told you it wouldn't work on me amnesia"

And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone

A super high-tech jet fighter
Floating over Planet Earth
Come back down here, I'll show you where it hurts
Take this bitter pill
Is it easy to swallow?

I'm gonna write you a letter
I'm gonna write you a book
I want to see your reaction
I want to see how it looks
From way up on your cloud
Never coming down
Are you getting somewhere?
Or did you get lost in Amsterdam?

amsterdam,john cale,Already processed,"She's back from Amsterdam
And I think the journey did her well
Her face has lost its touch
The tell-tale signs of loneliness inside

But I love her still
And need her company still more
Come down, come down
Come down, come down once more
And I think the journey did her well

She says she fell in love
With men who knew the way to treat a lady
Her life has settled for the best of things
That I couldn't give her

And it's not her fault, she's not the one to blame
Come down, come down
Come down, come down once more
And I do believe the journey did her well
Yes, I do believe the journey did her well"
amsterdam,rick ross,Already processed,"We get ghost
You already know what it is
Money stuffed in my bag

Maybach shit!
Bright lights and dark corners, it's night embark on us
Refugees running wild Wyclef with a Sig Sauer
Nothing to lose, I was starving from the start
Now the same cat drive in Jaguars
Open fire when you see me yell out and make em whisper
The club that I'm a member, they'll be gone by November
Keys to the city got killers who slither with me
Lamborghini, middle of the ghetto, smoke a fat fifty
Billionaire bid, wrists on chill
Standing in the field of dreams tryna see a hundred mil
These boys going blind they just happy being free
In a world of so many I just wanted me a key
Sheesh! I just wanted me a piece
Slice of cheesecake before my niggas all decease
These boys snort lines I'm fine just sipping wine
Amsterdam in the air, tomorrow on my mind

I am Barry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo?
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Raw blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm living through the beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick
Always running late, quick to show up with your bitch
The Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish
All stainless steel, quick to match it with my tool and
Red carpet event, the marijuana be lit
Red or blue, do you, as long as you're getting rich
Crack game, champagne, kilos on the stock exchange
Rolls Royce, new Ghost, that's a nigga pocket change
These niggas acting like they want a war!
When it come to whacking niggas I done won awards
Nigga, you a bitch, where yo' Honda Accord?
I'm riding in some shit only I can afford
Shouldn't claim the hood til you build a report
Amsterdam state of mind: I just gave you a tour
I'm laughing at the people who label me poor
Now I piss on Europeans, you'd think it was porn

I'm Barry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo?
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Raw blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm living through the beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

I'm speaking on unwritten laws - the code of the streets
I'm not the type of nigga that you bump into at a 7-11 and just pull your pistol on him
And do what the fuck you want to do
Niggas like me, you gotta get permission homie!
And that could take a long time!
In that time, I'mma handle my muthafucking business.
Ruugh! Ruugh!

It's the red light district, nigga this Amsterdam
Wherever the fuck I'm at
It's a no go
We greenlight you bitch niggas

Farmer John wants you
Louder and softer closer and nearer

Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you
In a year and a day to be sure
That your face doesn't alter
Your words never falter -- I love you

I'll be here waiting later and later
Hoping the night will go away

Pretend that you don't care

But it doesn't do a bit of good
You got to seek 'till you find
Or you never unwind

That love is not around
Still it's uncomfortably near

My old heart
Ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say
That my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up, all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun, you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me

Pardon me
But I got to run
The fact's uncomfortably clear
Got to find who's now number one

A chance is waxed and wanes
The night is young
Why are we so hung up
In each other's chains
I must take her
And I must make her
While the dove domains
And feel the juice run as she flies
Run my wings under her sighs
As the flames of eternity rise
To lick us with the first-born the lash of dawn

Sat here with ourselves in-between us

When I was small and all alone
Where dreams and visions never played
Towns put on their cheap parade
With cheap trombones and plastic horns
And choirs faking opera songs
I nursed my coffee til the dawn
And waited for another day

The lady on the second floor
She squints her eyes at bills galore
Opens up a cabinet door
Sippin' on bourbon through the day
She looks upon her mirror glass
Thinks how years have seen her past
She does her cross and dyes her grays
Fears upon another day

Chorus:
Another day, another day
Where dreams, they're not so far away
Seeds, they grow to lend a branch
Harmonies and second chance

Oh

Organized communities
Well, we call ourselves societies
But social is the last we seize when dignity has flown away
But I'm the worst than most of you
I write these words to fill some shoes
Pay some tolls, cheat some dues
Watch my words from far away

With wood and blood together twirled
Goodbye my friends, today I'm dead
To resurrect and change the world"

No one knows who we are there

Let's run away, I'll take you there

Apocalypse
God, come to my assistance.
O Lord,
You who cover Yourself in light,
You walk on the wings of the winds.
O Lord,
You who hear all prayers,
Give heed to the pleas and prayers of Your kin.
O Lord,

Lord God of Hosts, Lord God of Hosts
Free the Cherubim, Lord God of Hosts,
Guardian of the keys of Hell and of death.

Sheds the fury of a pervaded empire.
The eyes of the Lord are upon the sinful Host.
Grant us the crown of life, Adonaï,
Keeper of the adamantine key of David.
Nobody opens what was closed by You,

apocalypse,william s. burroughs,Already processed,"APOCALYPSE!
Mariners sailing close to the shores of Tuscany heard a
voice cry out from the hills, the trees, and the sky: ""
The Great God Pan is dead!"" Pan, God of Panic:
the sudden awareness that everything is alive and significant.
The date was December 25, 1 A.
But Pan lives on in the realm of the
imagination, in writing, and painting, and music.
Look at Van Gogh's sunflowers,
writhing with portentous life;
listen to the Pipes of Pan in Joujouka.
Now Pan is neutralized,
framed in museums, entombed in books, relegated to folklore.
But art is spilling out of its frames into subway graffiti.
Will it stop there?
Consider an apocalyptic statement: ""
Nothing is true.
Everything is permitted,
"" Hassan i Sabbah, the Old Man of the Mountain.
Not to be interpreted as an invitation to all manner of unrestrained
and destructive behavior;
that would be a minor episode, which would run its course.
Everything is permitted because nothing is true.
It is all make-believe, illusion, dream, art.
When art leaves the frame and the written word leaves the page--not
merely the physical frame and page,
but the frames and pages of assigned categories--a basic
disruption of reality itself occurs: the literal realization of art.
Success will write Apocalypse across the sky.
The artist aims for a miracle.
The painter wills his pictures to move off the canvas with a separate
life, movement outside of the picture,
and one rent in the fabric is all it
takes for pandemonium to sluice through.
Last act, the End, this is where we all came in.
The final Apocalypse is when every man sees what he
sees, feels what he feels, and hears what he hears.
The creatures of all your dreams and nightmares are right
here, right now, solid as they ever were or ever will be.
Electric vitality of careening subways
faster faster faster stations flash by in a blur.
Pan God of Panic, whips screaming crowds,
as millions of faces look up at the torn sky.
OFF THE TRACK!
OFF THE TRACK!
The planet is pulling loose from its moorings, careening into space,
spilling cities and mountains and seas into the Void,
spinning faster and faster as days
and nights flash by like subway stations.
Iron penis chimneys ejaculate blue sparks in a reek of ozone.
Tunnels crunch down teeth of concrete
and steel, flattening cars like beer cans.
Graffiti eats through glass and steel like acid,
races across the sky in tornados of flaming colors.
Cherry-pickers with satin brushes big as a door inch through
Wall Street, leaving a vast souvenir postcard of the Grand Canyon.
Water trucks slosh out paint.
Outlaw painters armed with paint
pistols paint everything and everyone in reach.
Survival Artists, paint cans strapped to their backs,
grenades at their belts, paint anything and anybody within range.
Skywriters dogfight, collide and explode in paint.
Telephone poles dance electric jigs in swirling, crackling wires.
Neon explosions and tornados flash through ruined cities.
Volcanoes spew molten colors as the earths
crust buckles and splinters into jigsaw pieces.
Household appliances revolt!
Washing machines snatch clothes from the guests.
Bellowing Hoovers suck off makeup and wigs and false teeth.
Electric toothbrushes leap into screaming
mouths, as clothes dryers turn gardens into dust bowls.
Garden tools whiz through lawn parties impaling the guests,
who are hacked to fertilizer by industrious Japanese hatchets.
Loathsome, misshapen, bulbous plants spring from their bones,
covering golf courses, swimming pools,
country clubs, and tasteful dwellings.

At my back – faster and faster – I always hear hurry up!
Energy ground down into.
Please its time closing.
Sidewalks and streets by billions of feet and tires
erupt from manholes and tunnels break out with volcanic force.
Let it come down!
Careening subways faster and faster stations blur by.
Pan whips screaming crowds with flaming pipes.
Millions of faces look up at the torn sky.
OFF THE TRACK!
OFF THE TRACK!
The planet is pulling loose from its moorings,
careening off into space spilling cities and
mountains and seas into the Void faster and faster.
Skyscrapers scrape rents of blue and white paint from the sky.
The rivers swirl with color.
Nitrous ochres and reds eat through the bridges,
falling into the rivers splashing colors
across warehouses and piers and roads and buildings.
AMOK art floods inorganic molds, stirring passion of metal and glass,
steel girders writhing in mineral lusts burst from their concrete
covers, walls of glass melt and burn
with madness in a billion crazed eyes.
Bridges buck cars and trucks into the rivers.
The sidewalks run ahead faster and faster,
energy ground down into sidewalks and streets by billions of feet and
tires erupts from manholes and
tunnels, breaks out with volcanic force.
LET IT COME DOWN!

the village, the Piper pulled down the sky!"

Shaded eyes they are the ones
Who'll lead you to your deliverance

From the figure of doom
Force you to understand
Lock you in a room
With a holy roller and a one man band

Come on, come on
Kill the rats in the gutter
Come on, come on

Come on, come on
Bring your father and your mother
Come on, come on
Sing it higher and higher

Shake the clammy hand
Repeat the 23rd psalm
Make you understand
Where it was you went wrong

Voices from tapes
Shouting with twisted tongues
Emotional rape
Hell fire scorched lungs

Blinded by glittery diamonds
Resting on crooked fingers
Shaded eyes they are the ones
Who'll lead you to your deliverance

From the figure of doom
Force you to understand
Lock you in a room
With a holy roller and a one man band

Come on, come on
Kill the rats in the gutter
Come on, come on
Sings the voice in the choir

Come on, come on, come on
Bring your father and your mother
Come on, come on, come on
Sing it higher and higher

Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on
Bite down hard till it sticks between your teeth

Is echoing, echoing yet

Summer died last night, alone
Even the ghosts
Huddled up for warmth
Autumn has come to my hometown
Friendly voices, dead and gone
Singing, Star of the country down
(Even the ghosts help raise the barn
Here, now, in my hometown)
When, out of the massing that bodes and bides
in the cold west
Flew a waxwing, who froze
And died against my breast
And all the while, rain
Like a weed in the tide
Swans and lists
Down on the gossiping lawns
Saying tsk tsk tsk
I may have changed
It's hard to gauge
Time won't account for how I've aged
Would I could tie your lying tongue
Who says that leaving keeps you young
And I have got no control
Over my heart, over my mind
Over the hills
the rainclouds roll
I'll winter here, wait for a sign
To cast myself out over the water
Riven like a wishbone
You'd hardly guess
I was my own mother's daughter
I ain't naturally given to roam
And I lay low, when I return
And I move like a gurney
Whose wheels are squeaking
Alone, here in my home
And I laugh when you speak of my pleasure-seeking
Among the tall pines
Along the ley-lines
Here, where the loon keens
There, where the moon leans
There where I know my violent love lays
Down in a row of silent, dove-gray days
Here, in a row of silent, dove-gray days
Wherever I go, I am snowbound
By thoughts of him
Whom I would sun
I loved them all
One by one
Cannot gain ground
Cannot outrun
But time marches along
You can't always stick around
But, when the final count is done
I will be in my hometown
I will be in my hometown"

You did not raise me there
Your laws do not compel me
To kneel grotesque and bare
I myself am the piedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare

You who wish to conquer pain
You must learn what makes me kind
The crumbs of love that you offer me
They're the crumbs I've left behind
Your pain is no credential here
It's just the shadow, shadow of my wound

I have begun to long for you
I who have no greed
I have begun to ask for you
I who have no need
You say you've gone away from me
But I can feel you when you breathe

baby boy,big brovaz,Already processed,"From the day that I saw you
I knew that we would pursue
'Cause the chemistry we felt that day
Felt so real and so true
Looking back on a year we spent together
How it's been,
What we went through
Although we've had our
Little ups and downs
We've still pulled through
Baby girl you're my world
My everything
I want to lace you with diamonds and every ring
Give you everything you dream and fantasize
'Cause you can tell me
That you love me looking in my eyes
You keep it real with me
I keep it real with you
You keep on loving me
I'll keep on loving you
Keep doing what you do
I feel your whole aura
And I can't wait to hook up
Again tomorrow baby
What
My love for won't ever end
You'll always be apart of me
As long as time keeps on passing by
You'll be my baby boy
Every time I look at you
I can't believe
I've found a love so true and
I took time to put
My trust in you
I must admit it was so hard to do
And every minute that I spend with you
You make me believe
I have nothing to loose and
Deep down I always knew
That you would be mine
Do you believe in destiny?
Because I got a funny feeling
This was meant to be
Without you I'd be lost,
I need you next to me
Preferably in a house full
Of luxuries and little kids
From day one I was sprung,
Knew you was gonna be the one
'Cause my heart spoke for the
Very first time in a long while
And every time you smile, I can see
Us walking up the aisle with you
Carrying my child
C'mon
My love for you won't ever end
You'll always be apart of me
As long as time keeps on passing by
You'll be my baby boy
If you were to go, I don't know
You're the only one who
Sweeps me off my feet
Makes my soul go week
The only one who makes
My heart want to beat and I,
I could never live without you
You know that what I feel
Has to be true
'Cause you're my, my sweet love
Ever since the first time,
That I looked into your eyes
I knew that you were
Gonna be mine
Feeling you from the inside
When you're not by my side
You're the only girl
That's on my mind
I never knew a love like this,
A long so strong
A vision so picture perfect
It could never be wrong
Along the way, you're gonna
See you belong wit Jay
I might have to marry you one day baby eh
My love for you won't ever end
You'll always be apart of me
As long as time keeps on passing by
You'll be my baby boy
My love for you won't ever end
You'll always be apart of me
As long as time keeps on passing by
You'll be my baby boy"

It seemed so long
I really needed a friend
Why should I pretend?

That Southern Comfort comforts me

And you sang your song.
And you made my day
In your special way then

I knew
That baby it's you
Baby it's you
You know that it's you I'm thinking of
Baby it's you

Try my best to get
Some friends, but something always went wrong
I come on too strong
Things were really getting rough

Getting tired of acting like I was tough I just had enough then, you came along

babylon,david gray,Already processed,"Friday night, I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing, green to red

Turning over TV stations
Situations running through my head

Looking back through time
You know it's clear that I've been blind, I've been a fool

To open up my heart to all that jealousy
That bitterness, that ridicule

Saturday, I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing, red to green

Moving through the crowds
I'm pushing chemicals all rushing in my bloodstream

I only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid
To show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

And if you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt

Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now

Babylon

Babylon

Sunday, all the lights of London shining
Sky is fading red to blue
Kicking through the Autumn leaves
And wondering where it is you might be going to

Turning back for home
You know I'm feeling so alone
I can't believe

Climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there in front of me

And if you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt

Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now

And since then my smile's been fake

But through one eye only that's clear

Was it something I did
In another life?
I try and try
But nothing comes out right
Bad Karma
Killing me by degrees

I took a wrong turn
On the astral plane
Now I keep on thinkin'
My luck is gonna change
Someday
Bad Karma
It's uphill all the way

I can't run, Can't hide
Can't get away
It must be my destiny
The same thing happens to me every day

Bad Karma
Coming after me
Bad Karma
Killing me by degrees
Bad Karma
Bad Karma

It's a dog's life
And it's not my fault
Ought to hang my picture
In the All Time Losers' Hall of Fame
Bad Karma
It's a low down dirty shame

I can't run,
Can't hide
Can't get away
It must be my destiny
The same thing happens to me every day

Bad Karma
Coming after me
Bad Karma
Killing me by degrees
Bad Karma
Bad Karma"
bad reputation,freedy johnston,Already processed,"I know I got a bad reputation
And it isn't just talk, talk, talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got
I couldn't have one conversation
If it wasn't for the lies, lies, lies
And still I ought to tell you everything
'Til I close my eyes
Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappear below my feet
Been breaking down
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Suddenly I'm down in Harold's Square
Looking in the crowd, your face is everywhere
Been turning around
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Don't try to be an inspiration
Just wasting your time, time, time
You know about the best I'll ever be
See it in your eyes
I know I got a bad reputation
And it isn't just talk, talk, talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got
Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappear below my feet

badlands,the growlers,Already processed,"Hot sand in my holes and tips
Hot wind whiped at my riverbed lips
Snake dunes lookin' like hips and tits
And big red eye won't blink he just sits
I don't know where I am
I think I'm lost in the badlands
Pawns full of thorns and I lost my head
No palms just a cacti to see if it's flat
No rock to stand on to see where I'm at
I'm looking for ground on a land that's bad
I don't know where I am
I think I'm lost in the badlands
Don't wanna lose who I am
But I'm lost i the badlands
Hungry earth makes survivors strong
Thick skin and thorns just to get along
Think about tomorrow when today's gone
Hangin' on a memory of where I'm from
Young and dumb and empty as shit
Muscle and thumb and fingertips
The desert sea is relentless
Dead red blanket
On a baby with a fever
Once you've seen death naked
You just can't leave her
Pawns full of thorns and I lost my head
No palms just a cacti to see if it's flat
No rock to stand on to see where I'm at

I think the voice of life went
It went bang bang in my head

And in this moment I have questions burning
They go bang bang in my head

And so I will not deny this
Not even try and fight it
It goes bang bang in my head

I had to turn my heart away
Smile like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails!

You lying so low into the weeds
I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now won't you, Barracuda?

Back over time, we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me
No right, no wrong, you're selling a song, a name
Whisper game

And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Ooh, Barracuda

""Sell me sell you"" the porpoise said
Dive down deep to save my head
I think that you got the blues, too

All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools!

If the real thing don't do the trick, no
You better make up something quick

bastard,dunkelwerk,Already processed,"We're watching the wastelands, no triumphant salutes.
Nothing heard yet, where are our troops?
We found them in the wastelands, in some ruins of death.
In the fields of glory, they all reaped death.
Here comes defeat! Come On, come on you bastard!
We want our troops back home!
We need support.
Bring them back alive!
No one returns... Horizon burns!
And here we are in silence.
Digging 1000 graves to honour the memorial.
Our troops came home dead... Behind cold stone we cower, 1000 days of misery.
We wait to face the enemy at the gates!"

be yourself,robin pecknold,Already processed,"How does it feel
When life doesn't seem real
And you're floating about on your own
Your life seems uncertain

So you draw the curtain
Pretending there's nobody home

Don't theorize
Look in your eyes
They can't tell lies
Though you may disguise what you see

The mirror is free
We once had a savior
But by our behavior
The one that was worth it is gone

Song birds are talking
And runners are walking
A prodigal son's coming home

Don't theorize
Look in his eyes
They won't tell lies
But if he defies what you see

He'll give you a key

Be yourself (why don't you be yourself?)
Be yourself (why don't you be yourself?)

Be yourself (why don't you be yourself?)
Be yourself (why don't you be...?)
We needed a tutor

So built a computer
And programmed ourselves not to see
The truth and the lying
The dead and the dying
A silent majority
So don't theorize
Look in their eyes
Are they telling lies
The ones that they learn on T.V.
What a way to be free
Be yourself (why don't you be yourself?)
Be yourself (why don't you be yourself?)

Beautiful girl, you're a gorgeous mixture
Of all that lies, under the big blue skies
My heart cries

Beautiful girl, you're a dazzling eyeful
Beautiful girl, I could never trifle
If I had you, you'd be my dream come true

There may be blondes and brunettes that are hard to resist
You surpass them like a queen
You've got those lips that were made to be kissed
And you're only sweet sixteen

Oh
Beautiful girl, what a gorgeous creature
Beautiful girl, let me call a preacher
What can I do, but give my heart to you?

A beautiful girl is like a great work of art
She's stylish
She's chic
And she also is smart

For lounging in her boudoir, this simple plain pajama
Her cloak is trimmed with monkey fur, to lend a dash of drama
Anyone for Tennis? Well, this will make them cringe
And you'll knock 'em dead at dinner
If your gown just drips with fringe
You simply can't be too modest at the beach or by the pool
And in summer time it's organdy
That'll keep you fresh and cool

You'll never guess what wild applause this cunning hat receives
And you'll never dream the things
That you could hide within these sleeves
A string of pearls with a suit of twee
It started quite a riot
And if you must wear fox to the opera
Dame fashion says dye it

Black is best when you are in court
The judge will be impressed
But white is right when you're a bride
And you want to be well-dressed

Beautiful girl, for you I've got a passion
Beautiful girl, you're my queen of fashion
I'm in a whirl
Over my beautiful girl!"

You ride the same subway
As I do ev'ry morning
That's got to tell you something
We've got so much in common
I go the same direction that you do
So if you take care of me
Then I'll take care of you

Beautiful people
Never have to be alone
'Cause there'll always be someone
With the same button on as you
Include her in everything you do
She may be sitting right next to you
She may be beautiful people too

Maybe I'll take care of you"

Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father and that means something to me

Everything crumbles sooner or later

But love, I believe in love

I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think different is the child of disease
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone

Without love, I believe in love

Without love I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here

birds,neil young,Already processed,"Spend the day in your bed taking medicine
If that's the only thing that keeps you calm
Well one of these days you've gotta get up
And get out
There is a purpose for all of my sitting here
If you can't understand well you could
If you could just stretch your attention span
Now, for this song

I hope that this is what you will want
Cause my throat will be the first thing to go
And I hope that some day I'll hear everyone say
Is that all you've got turn it up keep it coming
Cause I've got the words to keep the birds humming
Well there's gotta be something
There's gotta be something wrong
Well there's gotta be something
There's gotta be something wrong

Spend your life with a pen and a microphone
You wrote down everything that you could
In case someone gives them a second glance
Now for this long

I hope that this is what you will want
Cause my throat will be the first thing to go
And I hope I'll remember when everyone says
Is that all you've got turn it up keep it coming
Cause I've got the words to keep the birds humming
Well there's gotta be something
There's gotta be something wrong
Well there's gotta be something
There's gotta be something wrong

忘れたくないから 張り裂けるほど また君で溢れてゆく

そして巡り会いたい たったひとつの 思いがけない奇跡ばかり

Say I want to be left alone

Because I like my time with you

Till you rant and you rave
Wishing fat folks to their grave
But I feel sorry for them
You say they get what they deserve

Well, I don't wanna get bitter

And I don't wanna get jaded

Like you, with disdain for mankind
I was charmed, now I wonder

Well I don't wanna get bitter
I don't wanna turn cruel
I don't wanna get old

So I'll smile with the rest
I'll wish everyone the best
And know the one who made it
Made it 'cause she was actually pretty good

We dove a third out for the fifth

Other people's lives upon which you prey
It's a permanent disgrace

Why do you think you know what's best for me
What I should and shouldn't do
Why do you judge my history
And tell me to improve

In the confines of your mind
You think we're all the same
I've left them all behind
Though you wish I hadn't

In finding fault in others I can't see
What you have to gain
I know that you get pleasure from
Other people's pain

You're not so perfect and I realise the scene
That you're all coming from
When you say you care I know what you mean
You're really lying

All the people around here
Love to hear about a fall
They all surface and disappear
In an instant

Night is falling to the ground
But I can still see where you loved yourself
Before he tore it all down
April 12th
With nobody else around
You were outside the house
(Where's your mother?)

When he put you in the car
When he took you down the road
And I can still see where it was open
The door he slammed closed
It was open, the door he slammed closed
It was open, long ago
But don't lose me now, don't lose me now
Though I know that I'm not useful anyhow,
Just let me stick around
I tell you, like before
You should say his name the way that he said yours
But you don't want to say his name anymore
Oh, Cynda Moore

Baby daughter on the road
Wrapped up warm in daddy's coat
Well I can still see the cigarette's heat
Can't believe all that you're telling me
What is cutting like the smoke through your teeth
As you're telling me ""forget it""

But if I could tear his throat
Spill his blood between my jaws
And erase his name for good
Don't you know that I would?
Don't you realize I wouldn't pause
That I would cut him down with my claws if I could have somehow never let that happen?
Or I'd call, some black midnight, fuck up his new life where they don't know what he did
Tell his brand-new wife and second kid
And I tell you, like before, you should wreck his life the way that he wrecked yours
You want no part of his life anymore
Oh, Cynda Moore

Don't lose me now, let me help you out
Though I know that I can't help you anyhow
When I watch you I'm proud
When I tell you twice before should wreck his life the way that he wrecked yours
You want no part of his life anymore
Oh, Cynda Moore

It'll never be the way it was before
But I wish that you would let me through that door
Let me through that door
Let me through that door

And saw youre haemoglobin
With jackles from every trade
With boogie faces from motors

She's walking beneath the rain
Connected by flesh extensions
While I've been through every puddle
My little walkers connected and...

I shout grate the biscuits
Grip the slip and repeat it
Baby boys in the puddle
And mothers sent us to pen again

This is the big fear
And I'm reaching up from the swamp in here
I'm taking away the trust
While the screaming can turn the a saint (?)

She wrote
Throw us out in a week
With a flash little man huddle
And infinate maternal wear
We used to sleep on cardboard

I stutter with chopped image
Of rapping while she listens to playing
I heard of trouble funk
Wake me with a sentance

I saw you're dream flow slow
And saw you're heamoglobin
With teddy (?) cut daggers
And tusslin' with monster motors

You wouldn't stop water choking
He has that vein of magic
And I slip below the city far below the big eratic

Mob smile
Dat style
The diss manoevers other little child
Look to the side lines where I shine upon mu time

The Physic declines through sharp finds and blood lines
Upon the heath the dew remains cold
Though the sun shines
The other
Speak not of it
The moon will drag the oceans tide and then my heart will split

Back hunch
Eyes well
Thoughts mutilate a slide show
The darkest thoughts were used in a row
Wher did the child go?

A kiss is floating throught the air but never landed
Will you accept all these excuses in exchange for understanding

We saw a dream flow slow
And saw you're haemoglobin
Wher our love resembles clothing
And the beats are human clothing
And the thoughts of focus of consistence
Supersidal magic
I slip beyond myself into the realms of bad magic

Nothing but hunger in this
Rest a heartbeat and I'll get my teeth in blood

In the dark
Every breath leaves a trace that I follow, I will catch
Every mark

Move and surely my sharp eye will see you, stop and
I'll take you down
Joy of tooth in the bone and the gristle, blood alive
In my mouth

Some will say there is safety in numbers, tell that
Myth to the edge of the herd
Leave the wek and I might even spare your blood

Wizened crone that is bent by the river, She wears a
Necklace of skulls

Take the time to show you're mine
And I'll be a blue moon in the dark

While you sleep you'll see me there
Clouds race across the sky
Close your eyes and don't ask why
And I'll be a blue moon in your eyes

Morning comes and sleeping's done
Birds sing outside
If demons come while you're under
I'll be a blue moon in the sky

Let me be your one light
And if you'd like a true heart
Take the time to show you're mine
And I'll be a blue moon in the dark"
blue moon,billy eckstine,Already processed,"Once upon a time
Before I took up smiling
I hated the moonlight!
Shadows of the night
That poets find beguiling
Seemed flat as the noonlight
With no one to stay up for
I went to sleep at ten
Life was a bitter cup
For the saddest of all men

Once upon a time
My heart was just an organ
My life had no mission
Now that I have you
To be as rich as Morgan
Is my one ambition
Once I awoke at seven
Hating the morning light
Now I awake in Heaven
And all the world's all right

Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a pray'r for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon you saw me standing alone

You've got to keep thinking
You can make it thru these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs, lots of laughs
Everybody's saying that hell's the hippest way to go
Well I don't think so

I wanna travel the world but I, I just can't do it alone
So I'm just waiting on fate to come wrap around me
Think about all the foreign places we could be

I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside 'til you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Just think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day

Riding on waves, walking on sand
Digging in caves to find the treasures of the land
And if we find gold, well, we'll just throw it away
We can write stories bout the journeys that we made
(We could be big in Japan)

I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside 'til you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Just think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
Waiting on a brand new day

They said they'll keep me here
But I couldn't do another year
I said I'll see you soon
Because I whistle to a different tune

Think of all the places we could be
Think of all the people we could meet

I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside 'til you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day"

And softly murmured someday soon

Then tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say

Now when twilight dims the sky above
Recalling (thrills) of our love
There's one thing that I'm certain of
Return I will to old Brazil

Then I could take a walk around
See what there is to see
Time is just a melody

Walking fast as their feet can take them
I just roll through town
And though my windows got a view
Well the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for now
So for now I

I need this

Oh please just
Let me please breakdown

Well this engine screams out loud
Saying this beat gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
Because it's gonna sting me when I leave this town

And all the people in the street
That I'll never get to meet
If these tracks dont bend somehow
And I got no town
That I got to get
To where I don't need to be
So I

I need this

Let me please breakdown

I need this

But I can't stop now
Let me break in down

But you can't stop nothing
If you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind
That you kept and you know
You don't know nothing
But you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees
Not the glass windows

You can't stop wishing
If you don't let go
Of the things that you find
And you lose, and you know
You keep on rolling
Put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright
Put the blinds down low

I need this

Let me break it down for ya'll exactly who I am...(CAV)

That dude that make the other dude say that's my man, (CAV)
It ain't nuttin' I want I can't have
The haters know it's real and that's why they mad
They struggle so hard while I just lay back
They sound under pressure, sweaty and straight wack
I rock like this because I ain't that, (CAV)
Tell the players I'm taking the game back...
Matta fact tell the coaches, the GMs, and owners
Shut down the stadiums, it's ova
I make the cat's in the back draw closer
Get the comp choked up like white folks on Oprah
Yeah you dope, but (CAV) is more doper
Mo skill, mo style than mo folkas
I hit the lab with good shit to smoke up
And tell the sound man where I wanna go from
Blow up, skit sheet across the notepad
School em' all from the drop out to post grads
What history book you do or don't have
There's only two eras of rap, pre and post CAV
Now you know that
Stop the train, there's no place for the game left to go at

(BREAK)

CAV is my name but you can call me, (CAV)
It's all the same abbreviated or whole
Shout it out so it don't be a secret to folk it go, (CAV)
Short for Cavee but I'm not from Cali
I'm from the rotten apple, dirty streets and alleys
Bed-Stuy Brooklyn doin'it exactly, Get at me!

Holla!...Like Missy and Ja Rule
Ain't a crowd in the world that CAV cannot move
Hot dude, cats was thinkin' it's not true
But come front row at show, I got proof
I went from sellin' candy in junior high school
To servin' spoony g for the fiends, to gnaw to
Got sent upstate on bus, (Not cool)
In the yard thinkin' damn should've listen to ma duke
Come home in 99, what the fuck I'm gonna do
I won't move bundles, I got a new hustle
I quit pie baking, started rhyme makin
Buildin' up my rep to be one of the five greatest
And I ain't saying CAV the best nigga out there
But until he appear, I'm sittin'in his chair
And I'ma need a few moments just to get in ya'll ear
To make you forget the Duke was eva even here
I got two words for the world, BE PREPARED!
I got three words for your girl, DON'T BE SCARED!
And when they ask where the real hip-hop, IT'S OVA HERE!
And when they ask where Brooklyn at, HOLD YA EAR!

Moves like a dancer in light
Spinning around to the sounds

Let the life that you live
Be all that you need

She dreams of running away
Shine on, bright like the sun
When even the sky turns grey

I need you to hear me say
I need you to hear me say

Breathe, just breathe
Take the world off your shoulders
And put it on me
Breathe, just breathe
Let the life that you live
Be all that you need

Let go of the fear
Let go of the time
Let go of the ones
Who tried to put you down
You're gonna be fine
Don't hold it inside
If you hurt right now
Then let it all come out

And put it on me
Breathe, just breathe

Feel is true (but)
The demons will
Forsake the land

Find a gentle woman
For a gentle man

Taste my flesh and grief
Breathe
Crawl on your knees

My hunger is directed
Towards your twisting body
Shameless you demand
Punishment and men

My eyes are re-directed
From your twitching body
Towards the waiting crowd
Punishment's at hand

My anger is directed
Towards your shifting body
Breathless you demand
The use of force again

My thoughts are re-directed
From your bleeding body
Towards the folded shroud
We're closing in on the end

Hurt me
Scream what you feel
Hurt me
I need to know it's real"

As I breathe
The air of heaven
Drawing in your fragrance
When I breathe
I feel your fullness
Come alive inside of me
You're the breath that I breathe

Covered by the evening sky
I turn my gaze to where your kingdom lies
Deep inside me
A silent whisper in my mind
Sweet surrender to your love divine
Peace enfolding

In the stillness I empty my soul
And your healing presence flows

As I breathe

breathe,taylor swift,Already processed,"Right now we are celebrating Fearless and you know I mentioned a little while ago
That Taylor Swift tends to write a lot about love but it's not always happy songs

Breathe is another sad song, I like sad songs, it's a song about having to say goodbye to somebody
And the chorus just says over and over again, I can't breathe without you but I have to
And it's sort of like a mantra that I've said to myself on more than one occasion
Like I can't breathe without you but I have to, I have to do this, I have to, I can't but I have to
And so I wanted to write with Colbie so bad because I've been such a fan of her record
And she was one of my favorite, favorite new artist of this last year and I contacted her management
And said, ""Please let me write with her, I really want to meet her and I wanna write with her""
And so she came into the show in Nashville and they made sure that I had that day off
And so I met with her at her management company and brought her this idea
And we wrote it together and it's about losing a person who feels like a piece of you
Feels like a piece of you is missing but you have to because you have no choice

Off of Fearless, this is Breathe on Big Machine Radio"

And bleeding sun

I wish I could stay
Or silence the rain
The solid bars
Of all that's left undone

All that's left undone

All that's left undone
All that's left undone

Nights in the snow
When all you know
Is a velvet breath
And you all you long for

Light is a stain
A ball without a chain
The sweetest death
Might make you stronger

Gaze becomes eyes
To crystal rollerdice
The trembling ground
What have you done?

I wish I could wake
As the walls start to quake
From the impossible sound
Of air that leaves the sun

A summer breeze begun

A air that leaves the breathing sun"

This time might be the last time I fear
Unless I make it all so clear

Different pages from the same story
Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in

Take these broken wings
Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong

And make it right
This aching is familiar
It's something I remember
We can't touch without feeling

Can't heal without healing
Baby, it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole
I need you so
Only the young could fall so hard
Can be so careless, and ignore the scars
Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing

The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

Let us in
So you've moved out of the way this time
Making room for each other
One without the other
We are broken but we are moving still

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings
We're in this life together
Even when one moves without the other
You got to learn to fly, learn to live that love so free

brutal,paris,Already processed,"Paris is my name, I flows with ease
Cash checks, breaks necks and wrecks MC's
Who ain't down with the sound of the Panther Movement
Intense is a serious answer

The mic goes into labor you freeze up
Enveloped by the style that sounds so rough
Rehearsal weak verses potent as cyanide
A million and a half shot keepin' you high

But I don't sell 'cause what you're sellin' is never sold
Or dealed by the real mack brothers of old
Naw, I just devise a wise new formula
To keep you in tune without sellin' my soul

In 1930, it all began
With a movement comprised of intelligent black men
Led by Allah in the form of Farad
But later by the last true prophet of God

Elijah Muhammad, a dominant black leader
Of 'The Lost/Found Asiatic Pack'
And later by Malcolm, whose point was straight
Stressin' a black nationalistic state

Of self-sufficiency on a mission
He stressed thrift and pride and good sense
Killed in cold blood but the shit ain't done with
Switch to Oak town, '66

See Huey Newton and Cleveland Seal
Sons of Malcolm with intent to kill
And end the brutality inflicted on us by cops
Best believe, I won't stop

Teachin' science in step with Farrakhan
Drop a dope bomb, word to Islam
Keeps my brothers up on it 'cause I'm black
And now you know I'm brutal

Callin' all brothers to order, P-Dog'll slaughter
Stomp rip and choke those who thought a
Young black man wasn't capable of the intellect
Of gainin' respect without sellin' so check

I'm Paris, six feet two, deadly as ice
But twice as nice with, the power to fight boy
So, listen I'm tellin' y'all, the warnin' the Final Call
We're headin' for Armageddon, it's like that

The government's policy see is tactical genocide
How many must die, chasin' a chemical high?
How much killin' and murderin' mayhem more can we stand
Before we fold black man, so take a stand

Listen up drug dealer, whassup with that?
Hope I don't bust a cap, straight in your motherfuckin' ass
For pushin' poison to youth, I'm through with talkin', I'm steppin' up
With gat point blank at your motherfuckin' mug

I'm P R O, B L A C K
Stompin' and crushin' to mush, any lush, in my way
I'm educated and strong, always right and no wrong
With many bullets of a Bensonhurst, come on along

It's like that y'all and I won't quit
Keepin' y'all fresh on the movement tip
With F.O.I. at my side, we're never slippin' or nap
We always come sick-wid-it, bustin' serious caps

There's no, bullshit and yo look, this is the danger zone
You shouldn't have stepped to it, you shouldn't have come alone
You shouldn't have ever thought, the movement was soft
Don't you know P-Dog'll never stop
I'm brutal"

To those who sleep while the restless burn
There are the few driven to flame
Most are content to drown in the wake of dreams

The trail lies overground
Across the years fade out of light
Ever growing dim to an age in the dark
Grasp from your soul, don't let it steal your eyes"

You said that you believed in me
And to take you on sometime
You said that you believed in me

I watched you burn
I watched you burn for me
I watched you burn
Burn for me
But now I wonder how
I stood by
I let you down
Maybe I couldn't see
That you would burn for me

We spend all our time lying side by side
Going nowhere, it's really something
Getting busy doing nothing
We spend all our time running for our lives
Going nowhere, it's really something
Getting busy, doing nothing
No magazines or DVDs, we both got
Better things to do
I'll hold your hand
Or shall we dance together
It's just so hard to choose
Every time we hear
The whole world rushing by
I know that we're not crazy

Swallow purple terror candy
Don't forget to breathe
Sickened by the wanting
And drowning from the need
This dichromatic vision
Of one who does not care
To sipping cocktail sedatives
Two months to hide somewhere

CHORUS
Butterflies, Butterflies
Cut the stomach out and hand it over
Butterflies, Butterflies
My heart will be the bridge that-
You walk over

VERSE
The wolf has caught the chicken
And now I feel unsteady
Emotions on the blink again
So kick me when you're ready
Here lies a violet coffin
The death of my control
Along with all my skeletons
They put them in the hole

VERSE
Sickened by the notion
I give myself again
Choking on the bullet, the gun-
Thats found a friend
So raise your glass to sorrow
And drink to all the pain
Tie a silver ribbon around
The pieces that remain

CHORUS

Cut the stomach out and hand it over
Butterflies, Butterflies
My heart will be the bridge that-
You walk over"

Twisted inside out 'til we were drowning
From the first attack we could never go back so we just keep on coming

Was there ever enough for you

Why's it always feel like feel like

And you've got the knack to vivify
And you make my slacks a little tight
You may unfasten them if you like

Ride your tongue along your bottom lip then bite down
And bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch
'Cause they're the perfect jumping off point
Getting closer to your butterfly

Will you float on by?
Oh, kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
Or Eskimo your nose real close to mine
And let's mood the lights and finally make it right

So I'm coming to shine on the occasion
You're an open-minded lady, you've got it all

Except for maybe my own, I have my days

With my momma's mason jar
Caught a lovely butterfly

When I woke up today
Looked in on my fairy pet
She had withered all away
No more sighing in her breast

I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Every time I pin down what I think I want, it slips away
The ghost slips away

Smell you on my hand for days
I can't wash away your scent
If I'm a dog then you're a bitch

I guess you're as real as me
Maybe I can live with that
Maybe I need fantasy
Life of chasing butterfly

I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Every time I pin down what I think I want, it slips away
The ghost slips away

I told you I would return
When the robin makes his nest
But I ain't never coming back

A rider on the tremors

Thought I might pass for a regular
If I just kept out of the lights

Tore my heart out from my chest
Mixed it up in my mind
With the best freshest pieces of my soul

Chose the ones I loved the most
Drove 'em all down to the coast
Threw 'em in a big black hole

What is this chill at my heel
That makes the protections I've built around my pseudo world premiere
Tearing my utopian fiction apart as it happens to just pass along

I feel a change coming on
Rolling out of the blue like a storm
Crashing against my delirious thoughts where humanity's waiting alone

Somebody else gets what you wanted again
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it

But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change, can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah, oh

So we've been outnumbered, raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger, but we're faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes, says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change, can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah, oh

Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed, can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up 'cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah
We sang hallelujah
Hallelujah"

I said how did we end up here? you said happenstance
But i didn't understand so i made other plans
I ran to the ocean washed the blood off of my hands
I washed away my tears washed away ten years
Washed away the empty space in-between my ears
And you said all that i mean is that you and me
Didn't meet because of fate but rather probability
And you said the truth's like corn and lies are like weeds
You said the schroedinger equation collapsed perfectly
And i said mercy me be patient please
'Cause i don't know a goddam thing about the birds and the bees
I just know what i'm like and i'm like what i see
Even though it's hard to see because you just blinded me
And if there's one thing i learned in chemistry
It's that the gain of electrons is reduction, obviously
But you can't see electrons without machines
And you can't tell from my inflection if i'm being mean
And i don't know if i can take you seriously
Sometimes elections depend on the absentees

And my family and my friends
And all the little kids that love me make me strong
And no matter how this ends
I know i'll never ever ever be alone

Some day i'll be an old lady
With a big dress and an apron
A babushka and bare feet
I'll be out in my garden
On my hands and knees
And i'll be singing a song
That is really sad and sweet

And the smell of the cold, wet dirt reminds me home"

The one that always pulls us through
You always do what you gotta do baby
Because you're one of a kind

When your love pours down on me
I know I'm finally free
So I tell you gratefully
Every single beat in my heart is yours to keep

So close your eyes
Let me tell you all the reasons why babe
You're never going to have to cry baby
Because you're one of a kind
Yeah, here's to you
You're the one that always pulls us through
You always do what you got to do babe

Gets just a little leaner
We ought to fail to see it

**And if I go to the left
And if you move to the right
So that we've hit and spilled
We've turned it off in the night

Between the banks that roll
The glass hidden motion
Above we go on without knowing
The pines control the wild sarcasm
To hold us up

And time was held
Well worth the holding
Waste when you try to save
Save it and it ends up wasted

The trains won't ride beside us
But water moves beneath us
And takes away the sense of hearing it all"

振り向けばそれだけ

遅れてしまいそうだから
闇雲にその道を進んだ
明日を祈りながら

駆り立てるのは 眠れる野性なんだ
アテのない 飾らない 救いのない日々を
歩き続ける

Let me feel cloud 9

何かから逃げ続けているのか（終わりなき世界）
いつか辿り着いた時
夢の続きが見れるだろう

変わらない 怖れない 僕たちの強さ
絶望からの始まり手にしたから
忘れない 奪えない 遠い日の記憶
小さな骨が残されてる尻尾

Command what is tried, what is true
Without solution, with feet on the ground

The screwed upside of me that I keep
Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known
I guess for me there's just no hope
I've never meant to be so cold

What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am (is I'm sorry for the way I am)
I never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am (is I'm sorry for the way I am)
I never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold"

My cheeks were pink like a strawberry ice cream
I was so foolhardy
I forgot a cap which heated my ears
There was an eagle in the snow...
You made it for me
I had wet boots and head cold
But I didn't care about it...

Snow is melting now
Because of our love all-round"

To rid the earth of the lies
To will the rise above

To rid your heart of all lies
Their poison tongues

Burning cold
Now let the final darkness fall

I feel my soul go cold
Only the dead are smiling

The dream of the new disease
On wings of euphoria
Sucking terror from the needle scars

22 years of pain
And I can feel it closing in
The will to rise above
Tearing my insides out

I feel my soul go cold
Only the dead are smiling"

This time I know we're in trouble
You got me spinning in circles
And wondering where did the love go
You're not the man I used to know
Can we go back to before?

Oooh, oooh, cold
Ooh, oh there's something cold
It feels like you don't love me anymore
Oh, oooh, and it's starting to show
It feels like you don't love me anymore

The mercury's reaching a new low
Falling like leaves when the wind blows
How did it all chill so quickly?
We were the ones who were meant to be
I'm frozen I can't let you go
I'm stuck on the same song
Do you feel anything at all?

Oooh, oooh, cold
Ooh, oh there's something cold
It feels like you don't love me anymore
Oh, oooh, and it's starting to show
It feels like you don't love me anymore
And it's cold, there's something cold
It feels like you don't love me anymore
Oh, oooh, and it's starting to show
It feels like you don't love me anymore

Just got my feet back on the ground
Ice cracks and now I'm falling down-down-down
Can't give much more 'cause you just take
Everything good until it breaks

Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, where do you go?

I walked away and I lived too cold

Intro: hell razah

This goes out.
This what y'all niggaz all been looking for.
A litte story for all my brothers.
You know what I'm saying? sunz of man return.
We gon' walk on by and keep it moving.
Just when it got cold.
Cold sunz we got jewels, we gon' walk on by and keep it moving.
Check it. moving. word up.

[hell razah]
Aiyyo, my thoughts be colorless
The undercover rich, haters loving it, watch the hell king tut' with it
Queen's, bathtubbing it, my diamond's cutting it
Sharp and on point, fuck the tricks of the government
Money rules the world, watch my people suffering
Cops busting in, handcuffing men 'til they wrist bleed
Some read what they don't need, give to seed
Black, lebanese, rabbis in green fatigues
Microphone masked mc's, macabees
Hard head mc's get told and still they freeze
The truth came in flesh but still you don't believe
The best thing you know is the spots to find weed
Get the knowledge dungarees, we still struglling
Sunz of man, uk keep it bubbling
We come to clubs, like the ones who bring the trouble in
What, he sold his soul, life publishing

(chorus: 2x)

[hell razah]
Have to walk on by and keep it moving

[prodigal sunn]
I remenise all my dark days whenever I phase and kept a blaze
Y'all mental slave renegades, wasn't enough to eliminate
In my lifestyle of hard times and good times
Stood mine with the wines, became nice with the mind
Born intelligent, fuck elegant, I represent
For the ladies and gents, deliquents and presents
Everyday hungry, gun play on the sunny
Crews sweeter than honey, stars fuck for all they money
Stupid dummies, fifteen slugs flood the tummy
Thugs rapped like mummies, sipping remy's
The clip empty, feeling shifty, swifty
Highly intoxicated, simply in fatuated
Never thought he could be faded
Up in the hospital, critical, eating pickles
With no teeth, back on the streets he got beef for little keith and tariff
A walking death wish, living selfish, I sort of felt this
The fifth of september, he felt helpless and breathless

(chorus)

[hell razah]
Today, life, shoot out, a dice game, bank loot out
Jewels out, laying on three hundred dollar sweaters
Tools out, last day schools out, nine berettas and better
Carry the eighth or red leather, timberland weather gear
Hands in the air, this is a stick up, don't play for hiccups
You won't need a body pick-up, money in the laundry bag
Hungry comrads get they guns from a-rabs
With the loot that they had, they rob more victims on the av.
Today cash, examples of the program
Lord sun of man, stop killing your own relatives
Unknown start giving the liquid to the dry bones,
We all came from the same throne
Raise the dead with the brain poem, one is aimed home

(chorus: 3.5x)"

Frozen to the bone
To rely on hook, line and sinker
What a sinker
Sinking like a stone
You'd be better off alone

Thought that I was warm like mother, lover, brother
Brother, she was wrong
Me, I don't long to belong
(Time stood still with his fingers in his ears
Didn't want to hear it from another bunch of hollow men)

Cold, been excommunicated cos I'm cold
My temperature's been rated and I'm cold
Bring to me my big old sweater
Nothing more will make me better

I met her on Monday and my heart did nothing new
Seems she thought of me as some mystic, fatalistic, mystical guru
Me, I haven't got a clue
But floating on a magic carpet high above the earth
You can see the world like a Buddha, bread and Buddha
Bigger than you hurt
Don't you know that love is work
(King got caught with his fingers in the till
Where's your calculator? Will you leave it in your will?)

Cold, no heat on the horizon guess I'm cold
And Capricorn is rising yes I'm cold
Listened to my old Nockles
Hoped that it would warm the cockles

You can't fight the fear you can't, this is the road you're on
You don't belong to me, you don't belong to anyone
Your reputation lies not in your eyes, but those who dare
Will bite the hand that feeds when it don't meet your needs
When you got blood to bleed, you got a life to lead

In the flood with my blood I can hold you

Cold, been excommunicated cos I'm cold
My temperature's been rated and I'm cold
Bring to me my big old sweater
Nothing more will make me better

Am I meant to sit here and just take this
When you promised me
I would be the one that
You would never leave
Can't believe I felt for what you said
Does it make you feel good to make me feel like less than I am?
Does it make you feel strong?
Like you're a bigger man?
What did I do to deserve you to shut me out?
Did I love too much?
Is that what this is about?
I used to thank god every morning for having you in my life
And now I'm praying just to forget you
And you know why

And if you were gonna lie
At least be a man and lie to my face
So you can watch my tears turn to blood as I tear myself apart
Wondering why
Why I ever fell for you
Put myself though hell for you
Fuck you, I hate you
I love you, I need you
I want to run
I want to run
I want to run, But I don't wanna run if you're not gonna find me
So we should just pretend to be friends, right?
And fake our way to the bitter end

Cause I'm dying here

And on the shores of gold coast
On the balcony I search for sleep

And the clouds fall from the mirrored walls

Words speak and choose
Will make sense and lose
Capsize the tall tale but always fail

Words speak and choose
Will make sense and lose
Forfeit the tall tale, I always will

The host had his mouth sewn shut
All in the name of trust
When the blood goes thin, he's given in

You can spare us the formal toast
The drunken anecdotes
From this day on, goes on and on

You know when he falls apart
He listens in the dark
To the records turn, I'll never learn

You'll set it down
You'll set it down

Rolling on through.

Burning like a flame behind my eyes

Prisoner slave to the disguise

Disappear the only thing
Bittersweet surrendering
Knew that it was time to say goodbye

Always the last to say
Everything makes you feel
Like a walking away
Come on, come on, come on, come on...
Like a dream
(Come on, come on, come on, come on...)
The sky is falling
(Come on, come on, come on, come on...)
Is it you who's talking
(Come on, come on, come on, come on...)
Can I take these words away
(Come on, come on, come on, come on...)
Like a dream
(Come on, come on, come on, come on...)

Sovra placidi flutti si riposa
Mentre del mare nel profondo seno
Sta la tempesta ascosa.

Come raggio di sol mite e sereno
(sovra placidi flutti si riposa)
Mentre del mare nel profondo seno

Così riso talor gaio e pacato
Di contento, di gioia un labbro infiora,
Mentre nel suo segreto il cor piagato
S'angoscia e si martora.

Come to me now that I have found you;
Come to me; wrap my love around you.

And now, only fire can wake ya
Oh weeping willow
Coughing up my heart
Ask God to see my shadow
And kept us apart
Through my mind's every riot, or revelation
You've just now gone
You've just now gone, as I arrive
At every station
Come to me
Either early or late
I've learned this by habit
Now I know how to wait

Won't you come see me now, my love
Are you thinking of me
And how easy it could be
Won't you come over to me now
We could be together
Will you stay away
Will you stay away forever
I haven't seen you for so long
If there's something wrong
Come to me

I am thinking of you now
Close my eyes and you are here
Drifting through me
Like a gentle breeze weaving all around me
Like a fog caressing the ocean
Thoughts of you roll over me
I haven't seen you for so long
Come to me...

I know it's not over, this is just a passing phase
I know you're thinking of me too
You know what you've been missing
And I've been waiting just for you
I'm on fire but you're not here with me

Everything about it
Makes no sense to me

You're afraid of coming over
You're afraid that you love me
Did you stay away because you do
Even if I loved you too
Everything will be all right
I haven't seen you for so long
Come to me... come to me

Come to me when you're feeling alone
And you're unhappy
When everything is wrong
And you are longing for me again
Please don't be afraid, it's all okay, I'm waiting for you
You can come to me - you can come to me
I don't wanna see nobody else
Come to me
You can come to me

If you thought I . . .
Was in danger . . .
Would you come and rescue me?

Come to me..."

Yes the only one I come undone

I'm a sycophantic courtier with an elegant riposte
And needless to say you're the one that I need the most

'Cause to be here now without you
Well, my life's so incomplete
I'll tell you what you mean to me and maybe then you'll see

Well, I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again

Relax, I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding

You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're sayìn'
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now, I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

Okay, just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working good
That'll keep you going for the show
Come on, it's time to go

You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayìn'

Out of the corner of my eye

control,john frusciante,Already processed,"It's not the way I go
It's not the way I go
Noone here hears me
I'm sick of people knowing me
Life's confusing me
There's so much I don't see
Something's controlling me
It's no way to live
I haven't got a thing to give
And those signs trade off
I'm a line from loud to soft
For what I have to say
I wanted to build a stage
I wanted to feel this way
All this things are real
I don't know my own field
You will prove me wrong
I don't know one
I see now what I've got
It reveals just what is is not
Someday I'll take it away
There's nothing for me anyway
Love don't choose me
Wide don't see a thing
What I'm saying is now
I don't know what it's about
I wander through the dawn
So much goes on
Who will make me run
I admit I might be wrong
These letters shelter me now
I wonder how"

Sometimes you think everything
Is wrapped inside a diamond ring
Love just needs a witness
And a little forgivness
And a halo of patience
And a less sporadic pace and
I'm learning to be brave
In my beautiful mistakes

Oh I've felt that fire
And I have been burned
But I wouldn't trade the pain
For what I've learned
I wouldn't trade the pain
For what I've learned.

Irony, irony is hating love
Hating love for what it does to me
What it's done to me, what it's done, done

Come again from born in another form
Restricted by this strain
Marked clearly by an absent stain
In desperate times we pay a price
Then gasp and scream as they twist the knife
This is not a presence unseen
It's a future past from machete to machine

Opened up to the physical
The cracks were there in need of repair
But you left them to fend fi themselves
Watch chaos ensure as if you never knew

Maybe just maybe we should tell you
Maybe just maybe we can feel you
Maybe just maybe we can save you
Maybe just maybe we will kill you

Means we can't compete

With the stroke of a pen
Ground beneath we descends
Into a never-ending bottomless shift

There's a world of something in this

Blood a' boil under flesh
Mechanism of stress
Come like we're still unaware
Why the numbers make sense
Divide invisible power
With the speed of desire
Substract the presence of guilt
From the riches of pleasure

Now you're opened up to the physical
The cracks were there in need of repair
But you left them to fend fi themselves
Watch chaos ensue as if you never knew

Hi, Geri
Uh, is it okay if I come over and take a look at your exhaust manifold on your Dodge Dart?
I've got a piece missing somewhere on mine, and I'm not sure what it is
I wanna see what you got on yours, ha-ha
Throttle lever strikes dash-pot rod, the rod must push diaphragm back
Before it can move back, air must be pushed up in
This causes diaphragm to move slowly when throttle valve is moved away
Stream will force diaphragm out, the air must now vent, dash-pot is ready to work again
(Mhm, see this?)
I don't care what that—
(The rod, that they're talking about—)
I don't care what that looks like Geri, I'm telling you what the dash-pot is
Where's the dash-pot on here, Geri?
(I don't know)
Dash-pot is inside. Geri. where it's hooked up at
And that is not made— That is not made to regulate the fuckin' choke goin' back & forth!
(And that's not the end-loader?)
That's so you can get pure fuel in there
As soon as you start cranking it over, whoa!
It will start sucking, and when I start sucking, this choke here—
'Cause you can't just have pure fuel, it won't light, you have to have a little bit of oxygen
It sucks open and it cracks the choke like this
And that's how that works
(That is not what you just said)
I said no, Geri, the heating is the motherfucking spring!
This one here, as soon as you start turnin' over the engine
It's supposed to pull it back when the vacuum starts
When the vacuum starts, nothin' to do with fuckin' heat, vacuum
(Why are you screaming?)
Because you said— you said ""It's supposed to work off heat!"" no, Geri
(You said ""As the car gradually warms up..."")
As it gradually warms up, this motherfucker with the coil, the spring, opens it up
This has already done it's job, the only thing its job is to do is when you're cranking the engine up
After it's been choked, all it does is pull back, and it cracks it open just a pinch
(Then you don't know what it's called)
The Choke Vacuum Diaphragm
I mean, it's right there in the book
(Sure it is)
Oh God, you're a hard, hard woman to live with
(If it was right here in the book, I would have found it)
Oh you motherfucker, you asshole, you stupid son of a bitch, you showed it to me!
(What?)
You showed me the god damn thing in the book what it was called, that's what I knew what it was!
(Get out of here and quit yelling at me)
No, Geri, you're fucked!
(I haven't seen that in there)
""I haven't seen it"", you stupid son of a bitch
(That vacuum thing? Yes)
(We don't know what the little business is.)
(It doesn't explain anything, I haven't read anything that explains that)
I told you what it says (Yeah, you did, yes, yesterday)
I just told you what it did
And you're sittin' there saying you never saw that before and yet you're the one that fuckin' showed me it, Geri
(You stink like gas)
(I told you that fuckin' fuel filter was not on there)
(It's not that fuckin' orange business hanging across the god damn business)
Let's try rebuilding the fucking carburetor first, Geri
Let me tell you something, Geri
Let me tell you a little secret Geri
(Don't tell me any secrets, be quiet)
Oh, man, I quit, I am fed up, I mean
I tell you something and you fuckin' don't believe me
You show me something and you still don't fuckin' believe me
(I can't show you anything Michael, because your head is blank)
Well you're sitting there telling me that motherfucker isn't that
Well that's not how it works
Well, Geri, a mechanic told me that's how it works

And I need for you to know

I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you've taken away
'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me

Didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you've taken away
'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me

And it chills to the bone
Will anyone get close to me?

Didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you've taken away
'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me

There's mending for my soul
An ending to this fear
Forgiveness for a man who was stronger
I was just a little girl but I can't go back

I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you've taken away
'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me

Didn't say all the things that I wanted to say

Suck it up or spit it out. How's that medicated bed taste?

Breaking teeth, shoving lip gloss in your little faces

Keep a straight stitched face,
As the ground makes a bed for me,

I keep my eye where I fell, sends no replies.

That you're never at home for the fun,

Up late, laughing bout the hard time we faced

Past the milky way and all the planets
There's something out there greater
But only god knows, scientist claim we came from apes
But they lies though, that was part of our conversation
I spark went up a star blazing
Thinking of how amazing she was
A angel gave me love

But mom you could never be replaced
I'd give my life up

You resting in peace forever I accepted you free

Smiling at me, happy knowing everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter
Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine

Do you think you'd like to come and bleed with me?
I'd like to invite you to taste of my chalice
It's a special one, it's made of gold
Passed out on your couch
You left me there, thank you
Let me sleep it off, I need to sleep it off
I need to sleep, why don't you let me?
I need to sleep, why don't you
I need to sleep

darkness,lamb,Already processed,"I couldn't see darkness until now
Only light!
(Though sometimes the shadows flickered across my view)
Light!

But darkness, this cold emptiness,
Somehow passed me by
Like a charmed thing I sailed
Slipping through its fingers

Blessed untill now
Blessed untill now

Only now, only now, only now

And I'm beyond recognition
Gone to some small space in silent stillness
Yet something beats anew

Somewhere

I'm waiting to be reborn

Only this time, only this time, only this time
Born in darkness
None can dim my light
None. Can. Dim. My. Light."
darkness,rage against the machine,Already processed,"Greed
Causing innocent blood to flow
Entire culture lost in the overthrow
They came to see, take whatever they please
Then all they gave back was death and disease
People were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide
AIDS is killing the entire African nation
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation
But these governments, they don't mind the procrastination.
They say we'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation
My peoples' culture was strong and was pure
And if not for that white greed, it would have endured
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system
Their minds did slay
Their souls they cage
You feel the rage
This brutality can never be undone
But the sun has not yet set
The bass and drums and microphone a threat
That's when you've got to get the cry from the inside
And see that they're responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide
You turn your culture down my throat
Say I'm inferior when you vomit and choke
You fill my mind with a false sense of history
And then you wonder why I have no identity
We'll strike a match and it'll catch
And spread the insight we need
A tiny fire burning bright
Shedding light on the darkness of greed
A yes yes y'all and you don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed
A yes yes y'all and you don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed"

Life crawls from the past, watching in wonder
I trace its patterns in me.
Tomorrow's tomorrow is birth again.
Boats burn the bridge in the fens;
The time of the past returns to my life
And uses it.

Don't blame me for the letters that may form in the sand;
Don't look in my eyes, you may see all the numbers
That stretch in my sky and colour my hand.
Don't say that I'm wrong in imagining
That the voice of my life cannot sing.
Fate enters and talks in old words:
They amuse it.

Hands shine darkly and white;
Only in dark do they appear.
Bless the baby born today,
Flying in pitch, flying on fear.

They shine in my eyes and touch my face
Where I have seen them placed before;
Don't blame me, please, for the fate that falls:
I did not choose it.
I did not, no, no, I did not,
I truly did not choose it."

But I can't, and I won't, say I try, but I know, that's a lie
Cause I don't, and why I just don't know

Maybe just a nice cold brew ""What's a beer?""
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fuckin year
And that fucker still talks to me he's all I can fuckin hear
""Marshall come on we'll watch the game, it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers""
And maybe if I just drink half, I'll be half buzzed for half of the time
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale man I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine, sound asinine
Yeah I know, but I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall, aim for the couch I'm 'bout to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out, cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I?

Man, fuck am I hungover and God damn I
Got a headache, shit half a Vicodin, why can't I?
""All systems ready for take off please stand by""

Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me

As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu, I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't, and I won't, say I try, but I know, that's a lie
Cause I don't, and why I just don't know

So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach then ahh
Couple of weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse, you lose Proof so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin you to get through
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later, full blown re-lapse
""Just get high until the kids get home from school Holmes relax""
And since I'm, convinced that I'm an insom-niac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Amb! en each nap, how many Valium, three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's, sleep
Ok so now ya, see, the reason how come, he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome, Heath
Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia, thing
It was baloney was it the methadone ya, think

Or the hydrocordone, you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases, with you Amb! en CR, great paces to hide 'em ain't it
So you can lie to Hailie, ""I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina""
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door, and wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu, I wanna get away from this place I do

departure,golem,Already processed,"Salt smoke from a beach fire
And shadows under the pines
Solid, clean... fixed
Seagulls perched at the tip of land

The needle at the neck
The high-handed enemy

White upon green
And wind comes through the pines
To sway the shadows
The seagulls spread their wings

The power of the voice
A test of humanity

Death so swift, like the axe's fall
Avoid the animal instincts
Repeat the old litany
Only the pure is to remain

Oh young boy, awake
Let this ordeal pass
Heading for new horizons
Taste the new experience

Doubts and questions, for time to reply
The myths of birth, denied by control
Possibilities, discussions
The obvious, the destiny

Oh young boy, awake
Let this ordeal pass
Heading for new horizons
Taste the new experience

And hear the wind
Blowing across the beach
See that the fire
Has scorched the seaweed"

And did you come
To stare
Or wash away the blood?
Well tonight, well tonight
Will it ever come?
Spend the rest of your days rocking out, just for the dead
Well tonight, will it ever come?
I can see you awake any time in my head
Did we all fall down?

Did we all fall down?
Did we all fall down?
From the lights to the pavement
From the van to the floor
From backstage to the doctor
From the earth to the morgue, morgue, morgue, morgue

Comprehend the guidelines

I'm so famous, understand
New York City respect my game like Joe Nameth
And I protect my name like yo' anus... in prison

Who am I? I'm the poetical pastor
Slave to a label but i own my master
Still get it poppin' without artist and repertoire
Cause Monch is a ""Monarch"", minus the A & R

Said its myyyyy desire
Yeeaaaah

My book's an ovary, the pages i lust to turn
My pen is the penis, when i write the ink's the sperm
Desire - the fire that ignites the torch that burns
This is not rocket science, this is easy to turn
My mic's a gavel, when i talk court's ajurned
Respect, even if you was 'ashes' you couldn't 'urn'
I embody antibiotics, you are infected with germs
Rap's fatally ill, please get concerned
Players pick turns to play, get burned
I telecommentate the game like Chick Hearn
This is the moment of truth for my opponent's? alliance?
Vocals alone evoke the emotion of black choirs
Fire, you don't wanna get burned like Richard Pryor
Move back, who's that there, the livewire
You will feel me
You will admire
My struggle
My hustle
My soul

No one can close the wound this time my f(r)iend
cause this is the beginning of the end
The beginning of the end!
Deceits and lies, won't lead you far, you're trying so hard to act like a superstar
Stood you more than no one can take, fallen for the same mistake
Manifestation of fake! Were others made to break?
Ain't your sanity wearing thin, now that everything is caving in
Dark days leads to darker nights
And the world crumbles around you
Is that what you desire?
Ain't there something that you'd die for?
Something that you'd really care for?
Is this what you stand for!?
Sacrifice! The Devotion to hate!
Lies! The only way to be free in your fucked up reality
Betrayal! You stab in the back for others destruction
Pain! No recognition for chaos
Is this what you stand for?
Ain't there something that you'd die for!?
Sacrifice, the devotion to hate
and I have given everything
Dilation of chaos is eternal
and this state of hate shell prevail
Keep grinding and grinding
Rip everything apart, destroy the world around you
Withering from within, until there is nothing left
Until there is nothing left!
This is your beginning of the end!"

There are some terrible gossips in this town
With jaws like vices
And eyes like drains

There are some little weasels in this town
Scampering around loose
With yellow teeth
And the beady eyes

We should set a standard amount of words
That I am to say to these
We should set a standard type of look
That you are to give to me
When you wanna leave

There are some terrible gossips in this town
With jaws like vices
And eyes like drains

I won't tell what they say about you
I won't flourish the shit
You are my dearest friend
And I will protect you
Until the end

With a will like vices
Complete as a drain"
dialogue,jackson c. frank,Already processed,"I want to be alone
I need to touch each stone
Face the grave that I have grown
I want to be
Alone

Before all the days are gone
And darker walls are bent and torn
To pass the time of those who mourn
I want to be
Alone

Rivers that run anywhere
Are in my hand and just up the stair
Past the eyes of those who care
Who can never be
Alone

Changes that were not meant to be
Tow the hours of my memory
Sing a song of love to me
To say you must never
Never be alone

The tears of a silent rain
Seek shelter on my broken pain
And run away, but I remain
To speak the words
That sing
Of alone

I want to be alone
I need to touch each stone
Face the grave that I have grown
I want to be
Alone"

You think I'm try'na holla at you,
And maybe I am but,
You wouldn't hear me out anyway's would you?,
Rather lose love than to move on never knowing what it feel like,
Short days, long nights,
By the phone, no call,
Need a clear mind 'cause I been blind, got me goin' down that road,
Heart made of stone,
Far away from home,
Black woman you cold,
Every problem you ever had with another man I gotta face,
Started off on thin ice,
Im still here but I cant skate,
Slow sink, cant breath, no remorse, dont think,
Listen to your friend get another man for a minute then repeat,
Queen, you deserve the title but she reject what I give,
While she nurse the wounds by them,
Tried them didnt work,
Diary of a black girl,

I wonder why I sit and cry,
Wish I could shed all these tears,
Im down and out,
Ill keep it moving and tryna get out,
I dont know how to move on,
Where I went wrong,
I wish I could live with no fear,
So down and out,
Ill keep it moving and tryna get out,
Somehow

Raised by a momma who, who,
Hate her baby father so, so
She dont have a problem with, with,
Saying fuck a nigga Quick, quick,
Im just tryna be the one who never run, but you run away from me,
Girlfriends man cheat, cheat,
Why not me the same thing,
She cant see in me, what I see in her,
This pain she inherit cant be reversed,
I cant even stay living in the shade of all the motherfuckers who played you,
The irony in that is that I aint even that, but you coulda been these pages,
Wife, you deserve the label but, but, you been hurt before so you dont feel your able,
Tried them didnt work, got impossible standards, nothing that I ever do works,
Diary of a black girl,

I wonder why I sit and cry,
Wish I could shed all these tears,
Im down and out,
Ill keep it moving and tryna get out,
I dont know how to move on,
Where I went wrong,
I wish I could live with no fear,
So down and out,
Ill keep it moving and tryna get out,
Somehow

See all I wanna do is be relevant,
Just tell me that I ever meant anything more,
That you could ever see me and you in another light,
But its like the dark women indoors in the darkest nights by the wrong man,
See all of them have made you incapable of a first impression,
What it do is I channel my aggression with no cable or antenna,
Just intentions to impress you if capable,
Hoping that the material possesions can materialise to a better you,
Cars, nothing I drive can drive you out of this state of mind,
For such an ugly picture and,
Money, nothing I buy can buy more time for your ears
To tell your heart to listen to it,
Diamonds, a girls best frienf is what they say but believe me with the right allegience shorty you gonna shine anyways,
And everyday that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary,
The day before is better than the present,
So anyone presented in her presence is doing these life sentences,
Theres no key for release,
No reason to be around,
Her minds in the clouds,
She writes it all down,
In her diary,

I wonder why I sit and cry,
Wish I could shed all these tears,
Im down and out,
Ill keep it moving and tryna get out,
I dont know how to move on,
Where I went wrong,
I wish I could live with no fear,
So down and out,
Ill keep it moving and tryna get out,

She hears the last song of the night
Hear a sound, turn around, it's all in the breathing

When the bad thoughts come with the creeping doubts
I'm not so sure that we have got this figured out
When things never were quite as bad as they are now

My vices ain't my enemies, I'm not proud of them but I'm proud of me
Tiptoe along the precipice of your god and death and ignorance
It must be in our alchemy to bite whatever hand that feeds

Ya' got to swing back at the heart attack
Ya' got 10 years clear, it'll take you back
School shot up on a routine traffic stop
Or get your block knocked off in the gridlock
Tried to play God but that was no fun, so listen son
This town needs guns

This town needs guns

Tiptoe along the precipice of your faith, your pride, your prejudice
My vices ain't my enemies, I'm not proud of them but I'm proud of me

Have a grip so intense

She cries out, she cries out
I want to be like the movie stars
And models on the screen

She wants to fly away from this
She wants to fly away from this
But she does not know how to
Fly away from this

She tries just to be what she's not
But she's destroying herself
She starves herself
This compulsion must end

A dragonfly is seeing it's helped

Lying on our backs in summer grass,
So fast the day go past.

It's blown apart by the wind blowing by.

Feel like I'm blowing the glow of the sun.
As soon as the afternoon has begun,
the sun goes down."

Where the universe revolves around the pupil of an eye
And infinities stretch out from infinities within

Am I falling asleep? is it all just a dream?
Well, the cars are like water and the road is like a stream
Rolling down through the city, flowing out into the sea
Going nowhere like me, going nowhere like me

When the morning starts to glow out in the corners of the sky
And the people come and go, and the time just passes by
Then i'm only gonna see it from the corner of my eye
When the planet spins it sings like the wings of a dragonfly

The pilot's set to broil, my nimble cook.
It's useless, flying kites
It only works if the wind is right.
And I've got a question for my dragonfly:
How to navigate through a perilous tide
Without a safe or sound device
Save only I,
Save only I?

So sayeth the law of shadow
No night is so long to stop day from following.
So long as I reach the air and finally feel my colours change.

Jump in!
Wisdom's with the pearls.
The little shiny eyes the oysters took.
Deception
Dragonfly
The underage plan to drink the night.
It's not so wonderful feeling life's something just in the way.
Call up the 30 winds 'til your Persian rug flies
Without a sage for sound advice.
Who's there
Save only I,
Save only I?

So sayeth the law of shadow
No night is so long to stop day from following.
So long as I reach the air and finally feel my colours change.

Oh, I'm willing, my dragonfly
No need to slice the dark, it's just as good, I've found
So jump in while the flame is bright
And if you jump when the wind is right
Think of this not as fire but lights of coming dawn
Coming dawn
Coming dawn
Fall up into the wind if she offers a ride
With no one else to turn the tide
Save only I
Save only I!

So sayeth the law of shadow
No night is so long to stop day from following.
So long as I reach the air and finally feel my colours change!"

In this dream I found myself making love to a strange man.
Only I'm having trouble you see, because he's old... and dying...
And he smells bad, and I find him repulsive.
But then he tells me that everything is erotic, that everything is sexual. You know what I mean?
He tells me that even old flesh is erotic flesh.
That disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other.
That even dying is an act of eroticism.
That talking is sexual.
That breathing is sexual.
That even to physically exist is sexual.
And I believe him.
And we make love beautifully..."

The stars smiled down on me
God answered in silent reverie
I said a prayer and fell asleep
I had a dream
That I could fly from the highest tree

I don't know what's left to say about this life I'm willing to leave

I... I feel the wind on my heels tonight
Let everything change to be here once again
Because everyone knows that we're gonna be totally free tonight
She's on my mind, I ain't got the time
For floating & drifting along with the tide, just a castaway

So how, how did we ever come this way?
Take another pill wash it down with something
You might read today, and meditate on this...
You're just another fish swimming round up & down in the dark gasping for air,
Always escaping the one who wants to eat you
Now rise to the surface, break through the water
Take a look around, listen to the sound
And for the very first time, reach to the sky
With the sun in your eyes see the world outside you"

That you call me to have the thing banned

Who's sound so endears that whole nations cheer and sigh

Is there a melody that could lead you to me like a lullabied child lead to sleep?

So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine
And softly I'd kiss you and weep

I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look, before flying east
Last on my list and then I quit to kiss your lips and weep

I want to play a silver note that fills you with hope
And tames you to feed from my hand
A turquoise chord that invites you to soar
And fly to a faraway land
The symphony that gently leads you to sit and be still with me

And grief doesn't frighten me
As its worst it delights me
But I'm gonna kiss you and weep
'Cause I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave
I'm a traveler with one last mile my journey is complete
I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look before flying east

And I feel like I fade away
Like drowning

I don't need you
But it's so hard
To be without you
Though you're not far away
I censor my emotions
And tell myself to bide my time
But every time you come around
You batter my defenses down
But so gently
Like some sweet hypnosis
And the world just slips away
I'm drowning

It's dark
My heart is pounding
I'm sinking down
Into a pool of passion
There's laughter as I drown
Like so many lost before me
Damned by lust and gone to hell
And then I look into your eyes
And something melts
I shake inside
And cool water
Washes me all over
Washes me away
And still I'm drowning"

drown,the golden palominos,Already processed,"I am sick with this

His scent swims around me
Like a perfume too heavy for summer
Me lost thing
Intoxicated
Curled within him
Drowning over and over

Charmed disarmed
He comes when least expected
Sits too close
Lingers too long
Stares too deeply
And claims me with something I cannot name

Lightheaded and clean
This is a gift
Biting tongue until blood
I am sick with him

Talk goes no deeper than tonight
Words are tickets to spend time
Skin is talking to skin
Loud

I know not to go too deep
But when his hands stop
Tremble, temptation
I thrill back
Open up
Crawl walls

This woman is no man's
This man is no one's
This one is mine

In a full room, alone on a couch
He is throned
Doesn't move
Knows I will come

Smitten
It vibrates
Makes drinks tremble
Food wastes time
Cigarettes are for curling smoke
And drawing me in

This is bloody business

Guilt makes for poor postcards
So he comes in for a while
What do we know of this?

Doesn't know if he'll be allowed to stay
But he looks a while too long
And stirs the close air
Dragging me to the bottom of the lake

Couches are for excuses
And temptation
Crushed in too deep to breathe
Swoon again skin you do not know
With hands that know too much
Of what you must never say

Flesh to curl to grind
To feign sleep to balance wishes
On tongues and wait for the time
Now

Cozy he calls me
Says I smell like sweet cream
Closed eyes bring on a luscious film
Of time and silence

He tastes like stars
He feels like thunder

Regret makes you bitter
He says
Come in and swim

We disappear into a dusk
We'll never own
And never quite shake

A luscious slice
Of water
Lack of sleep makes me drift
Lake of sleep makes me wonder

He will exist
He will evaporate
I am sick with him, gone

In regret dreams he is low and sweet
Dark like a drift storm
Holding me down under the waves
Telling me not to talk
Not to move
This will only take an hour
Or two"

Clearly cause my blindness

The windshield is minstreled, the whole grill is road kill
So trill and so sincere, yea I'm both them there
Took both pills when a bloke in a trench coat
And the locs in a chair had approached him here

Made it clear as a ghost so a biter of the throats in the mirror

And in her mind and at the same time

With no neck left to hang a chain with

Which makes me necklace less like a necklace theft
And I ain't use my headrest yet
They said they need proof like a vestless chest
About the best fair FF jet in the nest

Who exudes confidence and excess depth
Even scuba Steve will find it hard to breathe
Around these leagues, my snorkel is a tuba
Lu the ruler around these seas

Westside Poseidon, Westside beside him
Chest high and rising almost touching the knees
Of stewardess and the pilot, lucky they make you flowered

What is not said.

Or who will harvest what we have sown,
Or how I've been dulling and dumbing,
In the service of the heart alone.

Or how I am worn to the bone by the river,
And in the river made of light,
I'm your little life-giver,
I will give my life.

Haven't you seen what I've seen?
Don't you know what you ought to do?
I was born to love, and
I intend to love you.

Down in the valley where the fields are green,
Watch my luck turn, fro and to;
Pluck every last daisy clean,
Till only I may love you.

I am easy,
Easy to keep.
Honey, you please me
Even in your sleep.
But my arms want to carry,
My heart wants to hold;
Tell me your worries,
I want to be told.

Sit and see how the fog from the port in the bay
Lays like snow at the foot of the Roanoke.
Hear the frog going courting
Till the day he croaks.

Saying even then, how there is light in the river,
And there is a river made of light;
C'mon, you little life-giver,
Give your life.

Who asked you?
Who asked you if you want to be
Loved
By me?

Who died and made
You in charge of who loves who?
All the livelong day,
If I have my way, I will love you.

But One can't carry the weight,
Or change the fate of Two.
I've been waiting for a break,
How long's it gonna take? Let me love you.

How about it?
How about what I have to say?
How about that livelong day?
How am I gonna stay here without you?

You must not fear;
You must meet me to see me,
I am barely here.

And I appear.

The people with the answers won't tell the people with the questions the answers

So the people with the questions they ask the people with the answers
But the people with the answers won't speak to them
Because the people with the answers give the people with the questions
Just a little bit too hard a time to speak to

I'm a man who likes to be alone
I'm a man who likes to think alone
I don't have too many answers, but I got a whole heap of questions
I got a whole heap of questions that I won't hide from you

So low, don't smile you get high (?)

So the people with the books they went and stood up on the mountain
To get away from the people with no books
The people with the books they started reading on the mountain but
They couldn't see a thing because the sky went dark
I don't know where the cloud cover came from
I'm just sitting here rocking on the station

I don't want to be the type of guy
Who lives alone, reading books, and never eats a pizza pie
I don't want to be the type of person sitting alone with a book on my own

With a book on my own

The people with the questions got together
With the people with the books and left the people with answers out
So the people with the answers started to make their way over the hill
To meet with people with the questions and the people with the books

And we all live together on a little round ball
We all sing together when the cuckoo calls

I'm not the type best living alone
Could we live together? Well, I don't know.

I'm not sitting here giving you a lesson
So I? ll just keep my mouth shut for the next few minutes

Can't keep quiet for long
I'm a human being
Can't help help singing this song
I'm a human being

You won't listen to me
I'm not an authority

So the people with the answers met the people with the questions
And the people with the books sat down
They finally decided to sit around to talk about their problems
To see if they come up with some answers to meet the questions
And some questions to meet the answers

Well, the leaves on the trees are green
(Ok we're agreed on that)
And the roads are not very clean
(Ok we're agreed on that)
And the food we eat is not very healthy
(Ok we're agreed on that)
And the music we make is not particularily good
(Ok we're agreed on that)
And the planets sort of revolve around the sun
(Ok we're agreed on that)
And the moon is a big ball with nothing on it, and I don't think anyone's ever been there
(Ok, so we're kind of agreed to that, so what are we arguing about?
Well, I don't know.
Ok. so let? s get together and smoke that pizza pie)

Some people with a pizza pie made me very high
The people with the questions smile
And the people with the answers lie
They lie

So no pizza for them"

When I die, I died in vain

The sun will shine
Still I can't shake her

This must be the essence of it all

Ah, ecstasy

The engine is gone
In its seat sits a box
With a note that says, Goodbye Charlie, thanks a lot

I see a child through a window with a bib
And I think of us and what we almost did
The Hudson rocketing with light
The ships pass the Statue of Liberty at night

They call it ecstasy, ah
Ecstasy
Ecstasy, ah

Some men call me St. Ivory
Some call me St. Maurice
I'm smooth as alabaster
With white veins runnin' through my cheeks

A big stud through my eyebrow
A scar on my arm that says, Domain
I put it over the tattoo
That contained your name

They called you ecstasy, ecstasy
Ecstasy
They call you ecstasy, ecstasy

The moon passing through a cloud
A body facing up is floating towards a crowd
And I think of a time and what I couldn't do
I couldn't hold you close, I couldn't, I couldn't become you

They call you ecstasy, I can't hold you down
I can't hold you up
I feel like that car that I saw today, no radio
No engine, no hood

I'm going to the cafe, I hope they've got music
And I hope that they can play
But if we have to part
I'll have a new scar right over my heart
I'll call it ecstasy

High with each step
And all the folk who'll see me there

Yea, all who from afar only my shadow see will say
For a great king
All his flesh and blood
Hold high festival and solemn revel.

And blessed is he
That hath children
Who will dance around his holy tomb
Such royal dances of victory.

We are three muscle spirits
In electricity
Force and aim in energy
While you are merely two

A form, if that
Motion - a minimum
And content defeated
The worshippers of lies

Our muscle - the fist!
Our spirit - intrepid!
Our light - blood!
Our duty - war!

Three crushing two
Muscle wrenching form
Force fights inertia
Deciding factor

The world isn't there
It never was
Harness the thought

It has no choice
It must bend
This power

This power
This power is ours alone

Our head - clear!
Our hands - clean!
Our eyes - open!

The stagnant multitudes
The hour approaches
And we exult in moment

A pit of burning corpses
And sing
An ode to joy
Avenge the murder of the spirit.

Losing who you are,

Playing in your ear,
And I'm listening, and I'm listening
And then I dissapear

And then I feel a change

Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide

And suddenly im flying
Flying like a bird

Sparks inside of me
And i'm free, I'm free

It's a bit like being angry,
It's a bit like being scared,
Confused and all mixed up,
And mad as hell,
It's like when you've been crying,
And you're empty, and you're full,
I don't know what it is,
It's hard to tell,

Its like that theres some music,
Playing in your ear,
But the music,
Is impossible,
Impossible to hear,

But then i feel it move me,

Niin äiti saapui huoneeseen
Valituksen kuullessaan
Hän vaiti katsoi juoneeseen
Kalmankalpeaan

Veti verhot ikkunaan
Ja otti tuolin alleen
Kun poika yski
Verta lattialle

Mitään sanottavaa ollut ei
Käsi tarttunut ei toiseen
äidin katse ulos vei
Aamuaurinkoiseen

Niin kului tunti, toinenkin
Ja hiljeni sen pojan peti
Ja äiti ylleen haalarin
Ja saappaat jalkaan veti

Yli pellon pahaisen
Raahusti naapuritaloon
Astui varoen
Vähäiseen valoon...

Ei kiire vaivannut kysyjää
Vain yhdestä oli huoli:
""Soittakaa kirkolle
Kun poika äsken kuoli"""

Sharing forces for the living

On past the busted back of that old and rusted Cadillac
That sinks into this field collecting rain

Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged?

Of these cut-throat busted sunsets
These cold and damp white mornings I have grown weary
If through my cracked and dusty dime store lips
I spoke these words out loud
Would no one hear me?

Lay your blouse across the chair
Let fall the flowers from your hair
And kiss me with that country mouth so plain
Outside the rain is tapping on the leaves
To me, it sounds like they're applauding us
The quiet love we've made

Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged?

Lay bare my chest, said, ""Do your best to destroy me""

I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine

Took out a personal ad

I thought it wasn't half-bad
Yes, I like pina coladas
And getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape

So I waited with high hopes
Then she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said, oh, it's you
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, I never knew...

Poitiers and then Anjou
The Roses War, the Hundred Years
Through battlefields of blood and tears

Stalingrad and the siege of York
The bloody turf of Gallipoli

Bannockburn to Austerlitz
The fall of France and the German Blitz

Chivalry to civil wars
Fascist rule and genocide

Send armies to defend us

Empires built and nations burned
Mass graves remain unturned
Decendants of the dispossessed
Return with bombs strapped to their chests
There's hate for life and death in hate
Emerging from a new caliphate
The victors of this war on fear
Will rule for the next thousand years

The song we used to sing
What was it's name
Danced together till the break of day

Sit and think about that girl from Spain
And how we used to sing

La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, Europa
La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, Europa

London, Amsterdam and gay Paris
Don't mean that much to me, they're all the same
People falling but no one for me
They can never match that girl from Spain
Now so many years have passed me by
And still I long for that sweet Spanish sky
Sènorita do you think of me and of this melody

La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, Europa
La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, Europa

A box of letters and a photograph
Are all that's left to keep our memory
Sometimes I swear that I can hear you laugh
Like a ghost of what could never be
At night I will look across the sea
And wonder if you could be looking at me
The ocean haunts me like a symphony that plays our melody

La, la, la, la, la, la,

When you learn of how to add up
All the good around
And you can paint the town
With a sad kind of beauty

Sometimes they will cry

If you often blow your cool
When hope lets you down
And you feel a clown

You're a carousel, you're a wishing well
And you light me up, when you ring my bell
You're a mystery, you're from outer space
You're every minute of my everyday
And I can't believe, uh that I'm your man
And I get to kiss you baby just because I can
Whatever comes our way, oh we'll see it through
And you know that's what our love can do
And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, you make me sing
You're every line, you're every word, you're everything

Can this life be the same
That spun me round and put me down
And filled me up with shame
And all the heads are turning now
Down the Tottenham Court road
Cause I just can't help but sing it out
Case I just might explode

I can't comprehend
The saxaphones blowning
Cherry trees snowing
Emeralds growing
Right here in my hand

A dance in the moonlight
So high on a June night
Magazines strewn right
Over the chair
Your spine a white ladder
Your eyes singing sadder
Nothing else seems to matter
As soon as you're there

Thy loving smile will surely hail
The love-gift of a fairy-tale. (x2)

Nor heard thy silver laughter:
No thought of me shall find a place
In thy young life's hereafter

Enough that now thou wilt not fail
To listen to my fairy-tale. (x2)

A tale begun in other days,
When summer suns were glowing-
A simple chime, that served to time
The rhythm of our rowing-

Whose echoes live in memory yet,
Though envious years would say 'forget.' (x2)

Come, hearken then, ere voice of dread,
With bitter tidings laden,
Shall summon to unwelcome bed
A melancholy maiden!

We are but older children, dear,
Who fret to find our bedtime near. (x2)

Without, the frost, the blinding snow,
The storm-wind's moody madness-
Within, the firelight's ruddy glow,
And childhood's nest of gladness.

The magic words shall hold thee fast:
Thou shalt not heed the raving blast. (x2)

And, though the shadow of a sigh
May tremble through the story,
For 'happy summer days' gone by,
And vanish'd summer glory-

It shall not touch, with breath of bale,
The pleasance, of our fairy-tale. (x2)

Are half a life asunder,

Thy loving smile will surely hail
The love-gift of a fairy-tale"

All these thoughts abound my mind
I wait for rescue and for a sign
I cannot kneel, I'm out of time
I'm face to face with my insides

I felt so bound by mindless ways
As life unfolds so does my faith
I've burned all paths that lead to peace
Now all of them feel sympathy

I'm singled out
My soul is pinned
I'm trapped in a state of question
I try to run away
But finding an answer beckons
How do you try, do you try to live
How do you try, do you try to live

How did I get here
Don't turn back

I'm feeling rage of a hurricane
I never thought it'd be this way
But now it is, and what to say
There's nothing so I must escape
Now where is peace and what is fair
Should we just march without a care
And go where we are told to go
Without a thought, without saying no"

Runaway, she won't run away

Faith, why are you growling in your sleep?
Do you stalk the shadows of your dream?
Little Faith, do you dream of me
When the fire is low and you are lying at my feet?

Runaway, she won't run away
Runaway, she won't run away
I called her Faith, I called her Faith
I called her dog and she came
She's a bitch, she's my little bitch

Faith you walk tamely by my side
But I see the wilderness in your eyes
Little Faith, thought you wander n your own
I know that when I call you'll come home
Runaway, she won't run away

And I ain't goin' nowhere
I'm here to make you happy
I'm here to see you smile

Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all
Oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well, I can tell you're afraid of
What this might do
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship
And that you don't wanna lose
Well, I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stand sitting around
While you're hurting babe, so take my hand

Well, did you know you're an angel
Who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart
Every time I see you cry?

'Cause I know that a piece of you's gone
Every time you're done wrong
I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope, by the time that I'm done

Who's gonna make you fall in love?

I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall

Bought weight from rastas, travel hot routes

Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit

Could never live up, could never live up
To my fantasy
Revolution from dissolution, hypnotizing and demoralizing
Pressure of the future, too much for today
How many hours will I let slip away
Before I realize existing and living
Are not the same
Are not the same
How could you be what I wanted to see?

Start it with a rumour, a whisper in an ear

? Feel what they're fighting, just tell them where to go?
Give the chance of glory, give the chance of fame
Give the boy an enemy, give the dog a name
Keep the factions fighting, start them off the school
Keep the factions fighting so you divide and rule
Football teams are splendid and fashion just a tool
Keep the factions fighting so you divide and rule

Marching ants across my temples, oh

Their feet had no intention
They followed some magnetic drum
Prisoners of their destination

From the slats of the factory come
Where once they did make rails
Old Death's peculiar songs
He didn't know I was listening

So he crowed out nice and long
To the spiders and the lumber and the dust
Of his conquests and his hunger, and his lust

I heard his feet rejoice
I heard him tap his cane
As if he had his own review
Onstage at the Athenaeum

I caught his words in my open mouth
I gagged and choked and spit them out
I heard him turn as he did hear
My tiny heartbeat in his ear
I was already running
Oh I heard him coming

Shrapnel spitting from his wheels
His scything arms rake for my heels
I dove and rolled and hid my face
And I said these magic words

My dove is home, her breast is warm, my dove is home.

I said these magic words and
Fell down, down, the anthill
For days

My dove is home, her breast is warm, my dove is home.

fire and brimstone,dragonland,Already processed,"A pale sun rises
The crowds are gathered
Now red streams flow through the streets

Upon the pyre
Enchanted beauty
Her eyes upon me

""Witch! Wraith!
Light up the fire
And feed her to the flames
Let nothing remain""

Now as I see her
Standing before me
A stranger I know
Where have I heard that voice before?

I'm stirred to silence
'Neath brazen towers
Doubt fills my heart with fear

See clouds are massing
On the horizon
Her end is soon here

I should turn away
And leave her to her fate
But something draws me to the flames

""Stop! Halt!
Who is this man
That walks unharmed by fire
That crosses the pyre?""

Now as I see her
Standing before me
A stranger I know
Where have I seen her face before?

Now as I freed her
They all stand before me

Stop! Halt!
Don't let them pass
They must not get away
Guards!

(Stop them I say) Now as I see her
Carried before me
I finally know
Where I have heard that voice before!
So far beyond the shores"

Kiss me slow and softly make me dream of you

It's just a mark of the people we are

It's just a monkey business,
They're running signs no remainders of since

We deal in abstract,
No pain and no deliverance,
This a punch i'm not punching up against

Oh, it's all just mirrors life and smoke,
We are livin' in some tiny joke,
And I'm hear to show my lust,
And be shown the...

Smash the lights,
Rip the shades,

I will never be tricked by you,
No, no, no,

That I would be this ugly,
I never thought I'd be biting that hand

That feeds the mouth,
That spits the seeds of money,
I'm just a shell, I'm a sensitive man

We make a choice to,
Unfold the tiny secret,
Put in lights for the grunt of this place

Is it the same thing,
To write it as to think it?
I'm choppin' noses just to ruin my face

Break down all the record company,
Did you turn your back on me,
Or did i turn myself against myself?

I will kick the walls,
Smash the lights,
Rip the shades,
Burn it all,
Firecracker, firecracker,
I will not complain at all

I will never be tricked by you,
No, no, no,
I will never be tricked by you

I'm still in love,
I set the love in motion,
I'm still in love with the future we planned

Tell me you feel,
The same complete emotion,
I'm still in love with your baby I am

Did you turn your back on me,
Or did I turn myself against myself?

Oh, kick the wall,
Smash the lights,
Rip the shades,
Burn it all,
Firecracker, firecracker,
I will not complain at all

I will never be tricked by you,
No, no, no,
I will never be tricked by you"

I fall asleep too early
I scream and no one hears me

From wherever the wind blows
Is it worth so much to try

I'm at the airport waiting
For lights to fade below
And then: something else
All instant things are fading
The pain will go
I won't remember
And if the lights went out
If the elevator stopped
If we were lost where I was
Or in the deepest tunnel
The train just stopped
But you gave me no chance

The heat is on for the action to speed up and tension to ease
We could keep talking but only be certain through physical means

Patience is just another word for getting old
Resolution's just as impossible as letting go

Is there a hint of a vulnerable you there, a drift in your eyes
Could it be that the sharp and the blunt side have shifted this time

first sight,these united states,Already processed,"with her mouth making movements
to introduce thoughts, i sat
deafened by trust on that sofa across
quietly calculating
the logistics of lust, of when
unspoken things couldn't
happen between us, and once
all those were done and we got
through love, we would
shoot through the hip, reacting
off of the cuff, splitting
up at the fork when the going got rough,
with a plan
for a point to rejoin on the road further up
our windows thin where the ice
carved its flowers, i would
hold her, let the wind beat
back those hours, and then
standing on subway trains, clutching her dress,
dependent
on her balance, since the walls were useless, and while it's
alright to hold tight, please don't try to hold on,
cos it's a
homerun we hit, love, cos it's going and gone
and then the world turned so fast,
it was astoundingly still
and it must have been that moment
made of midnight on the hill, right when the
cataraxed alleycat
spat back at the moon, throwing out
into the night, time nine
life times too soon [?] we had
come such a ways, and knew just what he meant
there's a picture of the three of us at the gate
to the garden of eden

you can get home, but you can't
get in
locks are like longing;
an everchanging thing
and keys are just clouds
made of
metal and spark
we knew exactly who we were, and yet
couldn't quite say who we still are
i saw it all hapenning in one grand epic sweep, from that
first sight that we wouldn't
get to sleep for a week

We was uniquely in sync, already fucking and we only met last week

We were both young not yet antiques
So her mind set was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week you could hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep
The neighbors by the creek says my house stinks and it reeks on a sheet, girl
Streaks of red even though all pussy is pink

Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which make meats for my obvious feast
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot and rethink

Cause I ain't even knock on the front door, I used the walking mat as a cumrag
And all the Wolves fucked too, yes, she's a cum bag

Beneath this blanket of loose soil,
Wrapped around my mortal coil.

Well a stem is not a rose,
But that's how my garden grows.

The stinking poison for disease
Now it's all shot to hell and back again.
I seek redemption for the
Same old sins and I fall on my knees,
And I pray that all the poppies they

But fields of poppies they remain.

Posie wreaths they crown me.

I should just fade away, fade away

You'd never touch a lady

You're not too far from maybe
Every day you find new ways to hurt me

But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
Always having my heart set on you
Till the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
Fool

God resigned
From hearing my old story
Every night
I'm paying hell for glory
I'm embarrassed
But I'm much more sorry
All this pain
Begins to feel like pleasure
With more tears
You'd make a sea a desert
Salt my wounds
And I'll keep saying ""thank you""

Always having my heart set on you
Till the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes

Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis

In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo

Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one

Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness

Ain't no question who about to kill 'em

I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring

Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me

Old money Benjamin Button, what? Nothin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me
When they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me
No you fucking wasn't

You're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack

Chasin' that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood, and I can't even act

I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans

And I would never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, to the top
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park

My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention

I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer

Nuts they go, macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa

He ain't had a real buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose

Back into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it

This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it

When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place

We can't deny the monstrous
Our flesh entwined

Now disentangles with all its pain

Disease remission

I've been busy making my effigy
And I suffer the hurt of a fragile strength
I won't open the wound delivered by weakness
I won't open the wound aware of its weakness
And be nothing but the weak...

In longing and in sorrow
The burden of effort and the weariness of distrust
We part in wordless staring tenderness.
With sores, scars, and crippled healing

Hanging over from another good time
With another girl, little dirty girl
You should listen to this, story of a life
You're my heroin

All these drugs, all these women
I'm never forgiven, this broken heart of mine

Forever we stand
And we'll make it through
'Cause I know that I can't live without you

No...

They said we're growin' up too fast
What we had would never last
So we left without goodbyes

And then some times, well, they got tough
Roads ahead looked kinda rough
And all we had was you and I

We prayed to God on those cold, dark nights
And then we knew that it would be alright
We'd go through hell just to hold each other tight

Or when you sleep with her do you sometimes think of me

friends,bobby mcferrin,Already processed,"Of all life's treasuries
One is most preciously
Kept in my heart
And that's the loyalty of friends

And family gathered 'round
And making joyous sounds
Familiar voices warm the heart
I find myself alone and feelin' blue
Then I know what to do

I phone my friends in melancholy
And then sometimes I'm filled with doubt
Something will chase it out
It's having friends, their faith will win it out

The problems that we face
Are easier to take when you have friends
To share the ways and how you knew
That they will share the load

Then you can always go by day or night
You know that you're with folk, of course
I know that some of you
Can't think of any who you might call friend

But listen and I'll tell you that
You've heard it said before
And of it's truth I'm more
Convinced that you have friends just be one

No thing comes even close
To what we treasure most
Then to be with friends

No thing comes even close

Won't rob my home or take my honey

They blind you with their innocence

A line of credit cards with a land cruiser parked in the garage
And trying to make up for the times when you was gone

Being locked up while my heart was torn
You wrote me letters
Telling me when you come home things will be much better
I mailed you a pair of tims for a wu-wear sweater

Up in the penal dipped (?) for the weather
In difficult times it's hard to maintain
I strive to live in the shelter that blocks out the rain
And that rain is pain
For stress on the brain will have a nigga insane
Forced to stay awake
Late nights it's hard to sleep
When i peek
Cause the kitchen's chopped up (?) they be trying to creep on me
Mental explosion when i meditate over by taca lake
Thoughts remain calm like the ocean
Puff a little war potion
Everything relates to emotion
When i stare at the stars surrounded by trees
Sometimes i feel like a fallen leaf
Blown away by wind realities
Strong breeze, but you're free
I took the block off the horn
So let knowledge be born
Blood brothers forever
Killa b's on the swarm





Dom p's (?) past, guns blast
I recollect on the past
On how we ran wild together
Chasing cash and ass
Small time thing
Managing stings for nugget rings
Went back far like acorn fights on modern swings
Kingpin style, juveniles raised with major flav
Tenth grade came went on our own and severed ways
Never realized poppy would die or leave my side
Homicide never
I visualize better
You live forever in my heart son
Mentally dunn we roll together
No years past i still hear blasts as guns flashed
My nigga run fast he sumble to a lifeless crash
On the concrete my leg felt weak
I couldn't eat let alone sleep
This shit is way beyond bone deep
Now i sip beers
Shed a few tears with our peers
Play the rears
Do the knowledge through glares and cold stares
Yo it's hard kid
I swear to my unborn this war's going on
Veterans taking falls to young pawns
But i stay strong and try to move on
And live life to the fullest
Rest in peace to the god who took a bullet

full moon,the kinks,Already processed,"Haven't you noticed a kind of madness in my eyes?
It's only me, dear, in my midnight disguise
Pay no attention if I crawl across the room
It's just another full moon

Don't be afraid of me when I'm walking in my sleep
Don't get alarmed, dear, when I start to crawl and creep
Try not to listen when I mumble like a loon
It's just another full moon
It's just another full moon
You see before you a truly broken man
'Cause when it gets to midnight, I don't know who I am
Full moon's a-callin'
And it's put a curse on me
And it will never set me free

The full moon's still up there
Like a great white balloon
The owls are a-callin'
And they're singin' my tune
The night keeps a-callin'
I wish the day would come soon
To get away from another full moon
Here comes another full moon

If your hands start shakin'
When night starts to fall
If you're scared of the moonlight
And the shadows on the wall
If the face in the mirror
Isn't you at all
It's just another full moon
It's just another full moon

genius,warren zevon,Already processed,"I've got a bitter pot of je ne sais quoi
Guess what---I'm stirring it with a monkey's paw
Since I saw you coming out of my barber's shop
In that skimpy little halter top
Did you light the candles? Did you put on ""Kind of Blue""?
Did you use that Ivy Leaage voodoo on him, too?
He thinks he'll be alright but he doesn't know for sure
Like every other unindicted coconspirator
Mata Hari had a house in France
Where she worked on all her secret plans
Men were falling for her sight unseen
She was a genius
There's a face in every window of the Songwriter's Neighborhood
Everybody's your best friend whey you're doing well--I mean good
The poet who lived next door when you were young and poor
Grew up to be a backstabbing entrepreneur
Albert Einstein was a ladies' man
While he was working on his universal plan
He was making out like Charlie Sheen
He was a genius
When you dropped me and you staked your claim
On a V.I.P. who could make your name
You latched on to him and I became
A minor inconvenience
Your protege don't care about art
I'm the one who always told you you were smart
You broke my heart into smithereens
And that took genius
You and the barber make a handsome pair
Guess what---I never liked the way he cut your hair
I didn't like the way he turned your head
But there's nothing I can do or say I haven't done or said
Everybody needs a place to stand
And a method for their schemes and scams
If I could only get my record clean
I'd be a genius"

One second more is one second too long
We can disappear right into yesterday
Vanish in the air, baby I don't care
Long as we make our getaway.

Fingers running up and down my back
Setting me on fire just like that
I've seen it in my mind a hundred thousand times
And now here we are at last
I want to touch you like I've never touched you
I want to love you like you've never been loved before
And give you so much more

Can't think of nothing else but you all to myself

Shake dreams from your hair my pretty child, my sweet one
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
The day's divinity
First thing you see

A vast radiant beach and a cool jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by its quiet side
And we laugh like soft mad children
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy
The music and voices are all around us

Choose they croon the ancient ones
The time has come again
Choose now, they croon
Beneath the moon beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest, enter the hot dream
Come with us, everything is broken up and dances

Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile egg-shell mind"

ghosts,james vincent mcmorrow,Already processed,"The moon holds the light
And the moon's this spinning globe
Shedding light upon the road
The bird won't fly
And a bird without its wings is a low and tragic thing

We are ghosts
We are ghosts amongst these hills
From the trees of velvet green
To the ground beneath our feet
We are ghosts
We are ghosts amongst these hills
Pressing out along the shore
Pressing out along the shore

The mountain song
Matters not the thoughts of thirds
Matters only to be heard
And though I'm gone
I will come again in Spring
When the harvest can begin

We are ghosts
We are ghosts amongst these hills
From the trees of velvet green
To the ground beneath our feet
We are ghosts
We are ghosts amongst these hills
Pressing out along the shore
Pressing out along the shore"

Set upon the most dangerous of places
Through it all
We are left with a void in our chests
We're aching to fill

And the doves come to gather our every need
They lift them up to Heaven
Through the mouths from which we speak

God, will you help us understand the meaning of it all?
Will you send your angels down to us at our every call?
Sometimes it seems the world is passing us
Faster than my eyes can adjust

I can't decide if I'm living or I'm dying
So I test your love
And I test your love
I test your love

The doves come to gather our every need
They lift them up to Heaven

To the beautiful ghosts

It's the ghost of the future that you're so frightened of
So you turn to your guardian angel

And a few of them were all that you really dreamed of
Love was the thing
So the silver haired girl looks for escapism

To feel the empty spaces she's feeling
She depends on her music like a husband
And she knows it's no good to fall in love again

One day they were lovers
One day they were friends
There was nothing else to say

It's just the ghost of the past of what you want to be

In the black air under the trees

Overthrow the colors in your mind

Catch me quick before I disappear
I'm fading like the sun
And soon as I'm gone everything will come undone

And I insist that I'll be dearly missed

I'll pour down like water
In between the sky and doubt
we talked about 'forever'
and all our other useless words.

Until I say ""in his silent sound was the
peace I found"" but she hides behind
her eyelids. I feel the breath from
her nose on my neck as it blows by.
the warmth passes me (like her love did)
""But a tree once cut down
came up new from the ground""
she smiles a lie, ""that may very well be,""
she replies ""and so it goes,
it's the devil, I suppose but it doesn't matter much to me.""

Put music to our troubles
and we'll dance them away.

From my left eye flow tears of joy,
of sorrow from my right.
""You might seem too strong to surrender,
boy, but you're far too frail to fight.""
That old dull pain beats in my brain
it runs down my back into every limb-
And its more of the same
as the warmth that I seem to lack,
you'll neither find in him."

Your selfish ways stand in the doorway
And I'm not standing in your way

ghost,voxtrot,Already processed,"I'll be the one to let this roof cave in on me
Buried in this house this wooden graveyard by the sea
We push away our families to understand our needs
The love and all the hate I used to hold in front of me

Restless nights all dizzy spells all sand between my sheets
Showing signs of thirst like dried out boardwalk-blistered feet
And now I know I never knew about you, only me
We carried this inside like some disease we couldn't beat

But we could work, we try to live and get by
To make our family in a second floor apartment
Standing on a threshold body out and flesh cold
Go ahead and celebrate the things you lost

Try to grieve, to flex and release
To cry and work out with the underrate apartment
Moments are a lifetime
Lockin' in a straight line
This could take a little while to shake things off

Down by the water's edge
Under a dying tree
I let my body slip
Something inside of me
But when I came around
Some kind of murky face
I don't ever want to be alone like this

And I will tuck into you like I always wanted to be
Shadows just a shade of light not darkness in degree
Oh, it was you who knew me first, this wasn't meant for kids like me
Some brutal natural force we only feel, we never see

But as you grip the tide
You blundered aside
Your heads got smaller until they vanished into silence
Sinking in a white foam
Running to a new home
We can only understand the things we see

You cease, desist
And view me like this
The eyes wide open in the beauty of the bright lights
Standing on a threshold body out and flesh cold
I don't ever want to be alone like this, no

I have no choice but to be vicious on my feet
I never sleep, I never eat
I am learning how to be lost completely

I want to be found, we crave the things we push away
These patterns cut like every day
I need you to reach, I need you to me

Down by the water's edge
Under a dying tree
I let my body slip
Something inside of me
But when I came around
Some kind of murky face
Shakin' my bones put me back in my place

I don't ever want to be alone like this
Haunted by the presence of things I miss
I don't ever want to be alone like this
Haunted by the presence of things I miss

No, I am becoming the ghost of myself
No, I am becoming the ghost of myself
Trapped little secrets, little things we never tell
No, I am becoming the ghost of myself"

A wise man told me that we are born with wings
But never taught to fly
Doesn't that make you wonder why
Is it to prevent us from falling out of the sky?
Or is it to stop us from soaring too high?
So let me ask you this
Are you running around in a circle, going nowhere fast?

'Cause when you look at the man in the mirror
He's made of nothing but glass
You're never aware that mountains don't move themselves
Tectonic plates takes something to make them shift
That all it took was a staff to part the Red Sea
All it took was a bus to Montgomery
A single woman who refused to give up her seat

We fought an entire army with a bouquet of flowers back in the '70's
But now you're taught to remain without will until you run out of energy
Afraid that if you strive for an ideal you end up like a Kennedy
It's like being on a treadmill every day but never losing any weight
'Cause to see success the food before you digest has to change
We're stressed and high, get depressed and die
But still afraid to question why
One of the biggest criminals I ever met wore a suit and tie
When did we stop believing? When did we stop marching?
When did we stop chanting?"

You split my skull and reached inside my head
And pulled out the pictures I'd been wishing I'd forget
And you stitched me up then
And wiped the blood from off my chin
Now I sit on the rooftop's edge
The muddy street beneath my swollen head
Trying to forget you
To believe we've never met
And the sky is wrecked, full of rotting clouds
From chimney mouths spewing smoke around
And I can't stop coughing
My lungs just won't calm down
But still I keep grinning
As the blood from my face stains the ground
A bird, caught in the wires
Bleating for help I can't provide, I'm not that big

I miss the meeting by the door

And in the telling of the story
I lose my way inside a prepositional phrase
I read his lips and I see glory
But what I hear is ""be afraid""

So from the fog of every morning
Until the heat of day is still
I watch the clock as it turns backwards
I see the water run uphill

Time has turned an angry face
And throws a dark eye back to see

As if might and will made right

Lovers laugh and cross this way
Weaving out into the street,
It seems we never were so young
Or it was never quite so sweet.
But the world is always beautiful
When it's seen in full retreat,
The worst of life looks beautiful
As it slips away in full retreat.

No more or lass than He'll allow,
God only knows that we mean well
God knows that we just don't know how.

When I took his life he fell to his knees
And as his eyes began to fade
He whispered softly
God speed this letter
Away from here
I'm sealed in with my tears
And stuffed in with my fears
And God speed this letter
Away from you
My work down here is through
I'm on my way
To better days and so are you

I'm in his pocket there I saw a picture of his children and his family
And I began to realize this person I despised
In actuality
Was not much different from myself
We probably could have taught each other many things
And now I know it's much too late
Although I couldn't hesitate
He checked his gun and his chamber was empty
Then I saw him standing with a bayonet
And as I ran towards him he hardly broke his word
When I took his life he fell to his knees
And as his eyes began to fade
He whispered softly
God speed this letter
Away from here
I'm sealed in with my tears
And stuffed in with my fears
And God speed this letter
Away from you
My work down here is through
I'm on my way
To better days and so are you
We know not what we've done
And oh
We know not what we've done
God speed this letter
Away from here
I'm sealed in with my tears
And stuffed in with my fears
And God speed this letter
Away from you
My work down here is through
I'm on my way
To better days and so are you

golden,fall out boy,Already processed,"How cruel is the golden rule?
When the lives we lived are only golden-plated

And I knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for me

Though I carried karats for everyone to see

And I saw God cry in the reflection of my enemies
And all the lovers with no time for me
And all of the mothers raise their babies
To stay away from me

Tongues on the sockets of electric dreams
Where the sewage of youth drown the spark of my teens

And I knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for me
(Too heavy for me)
Though I carried karats for everyone to see

golden,red house painters,Already processed,"Sister woke me up
As he fell out of the sky
There's a golden place
Where the angels crash and die
You can jab and poke
But what did you ever give?
I don't hear your voice
Resonate like his
Hear it resonate like his

You were endless fuel
Burning fast and burning free
Not a wide eyed fool
That fell into the sea
That vanished in the sea

You're alive and good St.John
As the AM waves the horn (?)
You belong as much to me
As a shipped steered to the sea
As a ship steered to the sea

You're the corner stone
Filled my room with sun
When the polished vinyl spun
I will see your face
Crashing down against the wind
And it's a sadder place
When that crackling vinyl spins
When the crackling vinyl spins

You still living good St.John
High up in the yellow sun
We can find your vacant grin
In every thread store bin
You're a dime-a-dozen man
You're a dime-a-dozen man

And you're far beyond me
But your dreams touch so soon
And you're life was big and for
Like your words so beautiful
Dum de dum de dum:)
Always echo across the world"

She's alone tonight with a bitter cup and
She's undone tonight, she's all used up

Another so-and-so""

You are golden
You are golden, child
You are golden
Don't let go
Don't let go tonight

There's a fear that burns like trash inside
And your shame, the curse that burns your eyes
You've been hiding in your bedroom
Hoping this isn't how the story has to go
It's not the way it goes
It's your book now

You're golden
You are golden, child
You are golden
Don't let go
Don't let go tonight

You're a lonely soul in a land of broken hearts
And far from home is a perfect place to start

La, la-la, la, la, la
La-la, la, la
La, la-la, la, la, la

So this final verse is a contradiction
And the more we learn, the less we know
We've been talking 'bout a feeling
We both know inside but couldn't find the words
I couldn't write this verse
I've seldom been so sure
About anything before

Golden
You are golden, child
You are golden
Don't let go
Don't let go tonight

This world is a dead man down (golden, you are golden)
Every breath is a fading crown we wear (child, you are golden)
Like some debilitated king (don't let go)
(Don't let go tonight)
The Earth spins and the moon goes 'round (golden, you are golden)
The green comes from the frozen ground (child, you are)
And everything will be made new again (golden, golden, golden)

At dawn, and then they forget

And you're only allowed so much time on the shelf
Time isn't money, it's only a lie
Because everything lost can be found but your time when you're

Sun, the sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then they forget

So live in doubt, live in fear
And you might live forever
Or live it up, and watch your back
And you might live for better

You just look ridiculous in your disguise

Were it the other day
I fell asleep, now she's gone away
So won't you tell me all the secrets
that I need to know
Before I go and throw it all away
Before I go and throw it all away

Maybe there's a couple things that I should have done
Or I could have done
Well I don't know, but she'd still be here today
If I just changed my old perspectives or my attitude
Or the things I do
Well maybe she'd have never gone away

Chorus (done twice):
I am done, take me home [al. & Chuck]
She gave up a long time ago [Rob]
Take the time, take the time [al. & Chuck]
It's a shame he's the last to know [Rob]

So I'll just sing another song about the love and loss
to get my point across
Bestowing words of wisdom on the way
Unless you'd rather hear another one about the rain
or the singer's pain
and the important things that he has to say

Chorus (twice)

Bridge x 4: Rob on lead
(parts are sung simultaneously)
They were happy in another place
(Turn back the hands of time [Al and Chuck])
Always thought they'd get by [all]
Woke one morning, and he heard her say
(Turn back the hands of time [Al and Chuck])
Why'd I waste all of my time. [all, only Rob on last refrain]

gone,shirley bassey,Already processed,"Gone has my lover
No familiar step upon the stair
Now I'm alone
With my memories and his empty chair

Gone like the wild wind
Gone to keep some secret rendezvous
Has he gone for ever
To the arms of someone new?

They tell me I just cry to forget him
For he can only fill my heart with pain
There are times I wish I'd never met him
But I love him and I want him back again

I know I'm a fool
I need a rock to build my dreams upon
But what can I do?
For without him I can't go on

In my life there's an empty space
That no one else can replace
So how can I face the world
Now he's gone?"
gone,switchfoot,Already processed,"She told him she'd rather fix her makeup
Than try to fix what's going on
But the problem keeps on calling
Even with the cell phone gone

She told him that she believes in living
Bigger than she's living now
But her world keeps spinning backwards
And upside down

Don't stay so long, and trough cell phone
Don't spend today away, 'cause today will soon be...

Gone, like yesterday is gone
Like history is gone
Just try to prove me wrong and pretend like you're immortal

She said, he said, live like no tomorrow
Every day we borrow brings us
One step closer to the edge, infinity
Where's your treasure, where's your hope
If you get the world and lose your soul?
She pretends like, she pretends like she's immortal

Don't say so long, you're not that far gone
This could be your big chance to make-up
Today will soon be...

Gone, like yesterday is gone
Like history is gone
The world keeps spinning on
You're going, going

Gone, like summer break is gone
Like Saturday is gone
Just try to prove me wrong and pretend like you're immortal

(You're immortal)
You're immortal
(You're immortal)

We are not infinite
We are not permanent
Nothing is immediate
We are so confident in our accomplishments
Look at our decadence

Gone, like Frank Sinatra, like Elvis and his mom
Like Al Pacino's cash, nothing lasts in this life
Gone, my high school dreams are gone
My childhood sweets are gone
Life is a day that doesn't last for long

Life is more than money, time was never money
Time was never cash, life is still more than girls
Life is more than hundred dollar bills and roto-tom fills
Life is more than fame and rock and roll and thrills
All the riches of the kings end up in wills

We've got information in the information age
But do we know what life is outside of our convenient Lexus cages?
She said, he said, live like no tomorrow
Every moment that we borrow brings us closer
To a God who's never been short of cash
Hey, Bono, I'm glad you asked
Life is still worth living, life is more that we are."

As it is, I might watch TV
'Cause it's nice to see people more messed up than me
I say to myself, as I smile at the wall, just let myself fall

It's gonna be all right, no matter what they say
It's gonna be a good day, just wait and see
It's gonna be alright, 'cause I'm alright with me
It's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gotta be

I shiver, shut the door
Can't think standing here no more
I'm alone, my mind's racing, heart breaking
Can you be everything I need you to be?
Can you protect me like a daughter?
Can you love me like a father?
Can you drink me like water?
Say I'm like the desert, just way hotter

The point of it all
Is that if I should fall
Still your name I'll call

It's gonna be all right, no matter what they say
It's gonna be a good day, just wait and see
It's gonna be okay, 'cause I'm okay with me
It's gonna be, it's gonna be

As long as we laugh out loud
Laugh like we're mad
'Cause this crazy, mixed up beauty is all that we have
Because what's love but an itch we can't scratch, a joke we can't catch
God, but still we laugh

Get back in bed, turn off the TV
You say, ""I'll be alright baby, just wait and see""

I hope it's just your laugh that is infectious

Good morning
In sorrow
I know that
Tomorrow
You'll be with some winner
Who's richer, younger, maybe even thinner

Rubles in the bank and petrol in the tank of some Mercedes Benz
Who spends and spends and spends on booked up restaurants
A thousand phony fronts

But will he ever wish you a good morning?

Thank you, God, for something rare as this
What surely must have been a holy night of bliss
Gratitude for having thought of me
I know your time is tight, and yet you thought of me

And did I stumble have a fall,
Hit my head against a wall
At some point did we trade vows?
Are you just some high-priced service from uptown?

Good morning
Buon giorno
Ohayo,
Buenas dias
Hey, where you going?
Hey, where you going?
Does dasvedonya really mean good morning?

Please spare me derision
I'll do my rendition
A lengthy recital
Of every song with foolish in the title

Good morning
Good morning

Good morning
I need you, I need you
Who are you?"
good morning,the dandy warhols,Already processed,"In my good good morning
I'm up before the sun can bring,
Early morning, and everyone
Like a shining thing.

All my angels appear
Before my window saying
Good morning
In my good morning

In my good, good morning
I feel before my thoughts all spring.
Am I conscious or
Is this my unconscious being
No more like a dream than a
God before my conscious saying
Good morning in my good morning?

In my good, good morning
I'm up before the sun can bring,
Early morning, and Everyone like a shining thing.
No more like a dream, then a God before
My conscious saying
Good morning
In my good morning."

Take a walk down its molding streets
And feel right at home

Cities blur before me
A swirl of colors leaned against the sky
Gone so far away
And I never really told you goodbye

And I know it's kind of lame
But sometimes things just turn out that way
We were the best of friends
And I'll always thought that it would be that way

We started out with nothing
Wild plans and big ideas and dreams
You were quick to swing the hammer
Always fast with some ingenious scheme

Sometimes we argued violently
Forged it out of bedrock into steel
Foundations were so solid
And our instincts based on something very real

And I feel so damned nostalgic
Every time I think about those times
I forget how it became
That I wouldn't recognize you on the line

And now I start to feel so guilty
But goddamn it I swear to you I tried
To bridge between the distances
Before I left without saying good-bye

I have friends I met last weekend
Friends that I've had known since I was eight
Friends I've said goodbye to
Friends who unexpectedly passed away

Nothing is disposable
At least it's never been that way to me
It's not like you were an acquaintance
That I could say never meant anything to me

We were really great friends
And I always thought that it would be that way
Yet I wonder if I'd know you
If the guy that I saw last walked in here today

And I swear until I die
I never would've expected you and I
To grow so far apart and leave
Without ever saying goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

One lost his liquor
And the other lost his head

Ten sticky thumb prints on the door and the sink
But nothin' saw nothin' - just smelt' the stink
Five hundred mugshots and a hundred to one
Four forgotten and the rest just won't come

The rest of the year has already gone
When you've begun to think like a gun
The days of the year have suddenly gone.

Blood on the windows and blood on the walls
Blood on the ceiling and down in the halls
And the papers keep pounding on everything I burned
And the people getting restless but they'll never learn

I picked up a doctor - he's good with a knife
Says anaesthetic's a waste of his time
Works in a hurry but always worthwhile
Knows they won't be back for a long long time

Top of the staircase was ready to fall
We were still waiting downstairs in the hall
Watch out for big mama, she'll set you on fire
Or go for your neck with the chicken wire

The room was small but I liked it anyway
He watched TV while dreamed through my mind
And the pregnant girl was busy all the time

September and October passed me by
I decided to go home for a while
I got a lift with an old friend of mine
I wanted her still she reminded me on the way

So when I got home I went to see mum and dad
They asked was I okay, was I happy enough?
And I smiled and said that I was

A few days later, I decided to leave
I couldn't find anyone who would take me
The only thing I could do was take a bus
So at half six I left to get the late express

I boarded the bus with my clean washing on my back
I sat beside a girl all dressed in black
We talked and smiled most of the way
'Til her jealous boyfriend angrily led her away

Then when I reached the house, there was a party on inside
My friend came to the door, took my bags from my hand and
Welcomed me in from the night

As I was walking through the happy house that Halloween night
My friends were all there, my heart was glad
And my life felt actually alright
My friends were all there, my heart was glad
And my life actually felt alright"

But what will the boss say to you?

And what will your girlfriend say to you?
And the people out on the street
They might glare at you
And what do you know?
You're pretty self-conscious, too
So, you run back and stuff yourselves
In rigid business costumes
Only at night to score
Is your leather uniform exhumed
Why don't you take your social regulations
Shove 'em up your ass?
Why don't you take your social regulations
Shove 'em up your ass?
Why don't you take your social regulations
And shove 'em up your ass?

On Halloween.

Scary...

Thinking of all the cool creatures
That I will meet... on this night.
Ghosts and goblins and witches,
Roaming the streets... in moonlight.

Bowls of candy and goodies,
Delicious and waiting... in store.
The sound of cute little footsteps
As they approach... my front door.

Letting the children inside to drink beers,
Razor blades hidden in three musketeers,
Screams from the basement of kids begging to be set free...
That's what Halloween means to me.

Tightening the clamps that are holding
Their little heads... so tight.
Putting my lips to their ears
As I whisper, ""Please... don't fight.""

I promise I'll let you go home
If you swear not to tell... a soul!
Well, I'll just untie these—I'm kidding.
Now, where is my chainsaw? Let's rock and roll!

A pinch of your brother, a teaspoon of you,
With the head of your sister, would make a good stew.
I'd give you a taste, but your tongue's in the stew. Irony!
That's what Halloween means to me.

Give me something good to eat.

あの時あの場所の出来事が
残したものは tangible so
説明不要 for you
I'd give an arm and a leg
電子メール from me predominantly
聞こえてくるはず my voice

no denial, so 夢かなえよう
キャンタンカラス
onslaught of 論争と方針

hands,tunng,Already processed,"He stands with his head in his hands
In the corridor in A&E
He couldn't resuscitate her
And now he'll go home to his wife for tea

We sing as the sky falls down
We sing as the sky collapses
And make what we can of this
It's okay, we're all going to end up dead and gone

He crawls into her aorta
To pull him out of his reverie
And mentally puts her back together
With sticks and glue until she breathes

He crawls like a rat inside her spine
It's a passage to another world
He pulls on a coat of new born skin
And sends a secret message to that girl

Positions himself in space
And looks down on such slight a thing
Swears he'll make what he can of this
Because one day out there we will all be dead

So leave your imprint upon
All the atoms you press against
All the people you press against
Because one day out there we will all be
Leave your imprint upon
Every mouth that you press against
Every word that you press against
It's okay because one day we will be dead

All the little lights"

How your mind is set for it
When I know the fault's all mine

And still you're hanging on
You're hanging on
I know the fault's all mine

We're in the wait of something else
It's like a subtle sense
And all comes back again
But you're going all the way
It's hard to draw the line
When I know the fault's all mine

And still you're hanging on

'Cause girl I can't stop looking at you
Ooh, and the sweetest thing that you do for me baby
Besides the little things that you do

Well, if the world don't feel like turning
And the sun just wants to hide
All the stars come out to remind me
With the universe by my side

Because all that happens is happiness
Happiness, when I'm with you
All that happens is happiness
Happiness

We ain't got a whole lot of money
How 'bout a five star happy meal
Girl, any thing will do, it's just like a party
There's nothing left of me for you to steal, that's right

When the winter wind is blowing
I feel you blowing kisses in my ear
And when you think that you're just talking girl
You know it's singing that I hear

Because, all that happens is happiness

To fill my head with useless stuff
Wisdom sometimes comes my way
Stolen from the words you say

'Til I know where my life has sent me to

My life feels so worthwhile
When I go where you send me
When I can't find a smile
You've got one to lend me

My life feels so worthwhile
When I go where you send me
When I can't find a smile
You've got one to lend me

What I don't see will sometimes find me
The truth is not what love will blind me to

When I can't find a smile

All I know since I found you
I'm happy when I'm in your arms
Happy, darling, come the dark
Happy when I taste your kiss
I'm happy in a love like this

There's a house upon a distant hill
Where you can hear the laughter of children ring
Guardian angels, they watch from above
Guarding over the love that they bring
But at night I feel the darkness near
I awake and I find you near
And I'm happy with you in my arms
Happy with you in my heart
Happy when I taste your kiss
I'm happy in love like this

In a world of doubt and fear
I wake at night and reach to find you near
Lost in a dream, you caught me as I fell
And I want more than just a dream to tell

We're born in this world, darling, with few days
And trouble never far behind
Man and woman circle each other in a cage
A cage that's been handed down the line
Lost and running 'neath a million dead stars
Tonight let's shed our skins and slip these bars

Happy in each other's arms
Happy, baby, come the dark
Happy in each other's kiss
I'm happy in a love like this

Melted away like I was free

I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be, I could be happy, happy

Don't go out much at all
I've never been the type to call
I realise to be happy
Maybe I need a little company

So now you know, you know it all
That I've been des-desperately alone
I haven't found the one for me
But I believe in divinity

I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be, I could be happy, happy

I believe (I believe) in possibility
I believe (I believe) someone's watching over me
And finally (finally) I have found a way to be happy, happy

I was looking for a holy ghost

hate me,blue october,Already processed,"I have to block out thoughts of you
So I don't lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach
Leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape
To remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head
That make a porno feel like home

There's a burning in my pride
A nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you
Will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me?
Just to put it in my face
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things
I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally
See what's good for you

I'm sober now for three whole months
It's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart
Is the one thing I won't touch again
In my sick way I wanna thank you
For holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself
You were trying to stop the fight

You never doubted my warped opinions
On things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself
When it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away
That I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart
To leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things
I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally
See what's good for you

And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street
For every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry
And I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, ""Make it go away""
Just make a smile, come back and shine
Just like it used to be
And then she whispered, ""How can you do this to me?""

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things
I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally
See what's good for you

For you
For you
For you"

Everyone will tell you there's no place to hide

So glad they made it out alive

Everyone loves the fun
Everyone comes by
In the wind I crunch, I want to die

They can give me pills
Or let me drink my fill
The heart wants to explode
Far away where nobody knows

Do you believe she said that?
Do you believe she said that?

I said ""I hate myself and I want to die""

Half of it is innocent
The other half is wise
The whole damn thing makes no sense
I wish I could tell you a lie
Hey, come here
Let me whisper in your ear

Can you believe she repeated that?

If I'm with you I'm a happy man.
If you feel safe and cold
While you count your gold.
If your problem is you can't find

Mistakes are never lightly
And colours hardly run

You're over everything

And I can't find my place
Some voices all around here
But I won't back away
Instead I talk to you
You're so hard to figure out
One minute interview
From next to help breathe it out

It's a hard wait (yeah)
Hard wait (yeah)
Hard wait (yeah)

When every second takes its tour
With every kiss you kill me more
But I'm here and I decide
So come close and watch me 'til I die

It's true I understand too well
This price of touch and go
Still search your awful secrets
That I found out on my own
Come on just give me something
Or let me be left alone
Hide my face in the crowd
Just keeps me moving and moving out

It's a hard wait (yeah)
Hard wait (yeah)
Hard wait (yeah)
Hard wait (yeah)

When you've been there for a few at home
Because you've been off way too long
And it's too much just to leave again
So you've figured that you'll stay instead

Hard wait (yeah)
Hard wait (yeah)
Hard wait (yeah)
Oh it's a hard wait (yeah)

Just a tear on the falling edge
And in the end it's just another stretch

Find someone who's got the tact in hand
For every moment and stance
Every wink and every glance
You get caught up in another night
And you hit me with those hazel eyes"

Look at you you're growing old, so young
Traffic lights blink at you in the evening
You tilt your head and turn it to the sun
Sometimes the TV is like a lover
Singing softly as you fall asleep
You wake up in the morning and it's still there
Adding up the things you'll never be

Alright, I can say what you want me to
Alright, I can do all the things you do
Alright, I'll make it all up for you
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you

Time can take it's toll on the best of us
Look at you you're growing old, so young
Traffic lights blink at you in the evening
You tilt your head and turn it to the setting sun
You disembark the latest flight from paradise
You almost turn your ankle in the snow
You fall back into where you started
Make up words to songs you used to know

Alright, I can say what you want me to
Alright, I can do all the things you do
Alright, I'll make it all up for you
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you

Kurt Cobain, he never had a chance you know
Incurable romantics never do
He held a flame I wasn't born to carry
I'll leave the dying young stuff up to you
You get back on the latest flight to paradise
I found out from a note taped to the door
I think I saw your airplane in the sky tonight
Through my window lying on the kitchen floor

Alright, I can say what you want me to

Alright, I can do all the things you do

Would you try to run inside when it opens would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder finally believing His power?
Even if you couldn't see, but you could feel would you still doubt him?
How would you start acting?
Would you try to put the ki's down?
Thinking every drug sell that you make in the streets He can see now
Would a fiend even want to get high, would he stop smoking?
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for an atheist
It's hard taking this
Racist planet where they take another brother in a handcuff
Even if he innocent nigga get on the car put your motherfucking hands up
Thinking I'm a lose it

I'ma stop feeling like I'm Amistad's great great grandchildren

Since the quarter water days in the hallways making fake coke
Pass with the Reeses Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while that same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time to them cats never looked back Cristal blowing dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me
You see the broads and Bentleys is nothing less my nigga spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all I'd buy some new kicks free of any autographs so
Not to be recognized forgive me
It's becoming unbearable
Making hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on the hook there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise
Preachers touching on altar boys
Sodomizing not realizing God is watching before the Lord
How can they do the devil's work?
A man giving another man head in church
Hell it hurts just to fathom the thought wishing that I fled the Earth.

These can be lonely times
It's hard to know who's on your side

Who can you really trust?
Who do you really know?
Is there anybody out there

Some times you just can't make it on your own

If you have broken dreams
Just lay them all on me
I'll be the one who understands
So, take my hand

If there is emptiness
You know I'll do my best
To fill you up with all the love

I promise you you'll never walk alone

It can be so very hard
Looking for a dark horse in the night

I see you

I do know you very well
And I will until you can prove me wrong
Maybe I'll find you are not
Anything like what I've thought all along

And I'll find my way by your light of touch

homecoming,vienna teng,Already processed,"It's desert ice outside, but this diner has thawed my ears
Hot coffee in a clean white mug and a smile when the waitress hears
That I was born in North Carolina
Not an hour from her home town
And we used to play the same pizza parlor pinball

And there's a glance in time suspended as I wonder how it is
We've been swept up just by circumstance to where the coyote lives
Where my days are strips of highway
And she's wiping tables down
Holding on and still waiting for that windfall

But I've come home
Even though I've never had so far to go
I've come home

I pay the check and leave the change from a crumpled ten-dollar bill
Head across the street where VACANCY is burning in neon still
Well, the night eats up my body heat
And there's no sign of another
And I find myself slipping down into that black

But things are good, I've got a lot of followers of my faith
I've got a whole congregation living in my head these days
And I'm preaching from the pulpit
To cries of, ""Amen brother""
Closing my eyes to feel the warmth come back

And I've come home
Even though I swear I've never been so alone
I've come home

I just want to be living as I'm dying
Just like everybody here
Just want to know my little flicker of time is worthwhile
And I don't know where I'm driving to
But I know I'm getting old
And there's a blessing in every moment, every mile

Thin white terry bars of soap and a couple little plastic cups
Old Gideon's Bible in the nightstand drawer saying, ""Go on, open up""
Well, I'll kneel down on the carpet here
Though I never was sure of God
Think tonight I'll give Him the benefit of the doubt

I switch off the lights and imagine that waitress outlined in the bed
Her hair falling all around me
I smile and shake my head
Well we all write our own endings
And we all have our own scars
But tonight I think I see what it's all about

Because I've come home
I've come home"

Of bird long since gone

To spread it's new wings
Or maybe it nourished
A stronger sibling

Stop the rain from falling
Keep my ocean calm

'Cause there's nothing to replace
I was just a mere distraction
Till you found a better place

In your soul that's full of bridges
In your heart not built for me
I was hanging from the scaffolds
Ignoring treachery

I was just perspective
And I was just a fling
I was just the pillow where you once
Asked me to sing

A song that reminded you of him
A song that reminded you of him

At first I was exciting
At first I felt brand new
A breath of air so fresh and clean
You didn't know what to do

But inside you were hurting
Inside you were confused
You want to love another
To show another what they'd lose

I was just transition
An edit if you will
Until the man you left before me
Gets your love once more to steal

'Cause in the end he'll chase you
So terrified you left
And then you'll take him back
With his tail between your legs

I was just perspective
And I was just a fling
I was just the pillow where you once
Asked me to sing

A song that reminded you of him
A song that reminded you of him

Just let him go
To let me in
For I can never replace him, no, no, no
Just let him go
To let me in
For I can never replace him

You can never know when you go
That's why you tell them baby
You tell him that you love him

Baby how much can I tell you
That I love love love you
Baby how much can I tell you
That I love love love you

Baby we need to be strong
We'll keep love alive,
That's why I sing this song
For you
I'm gonna tell the world
I love you

Baby how much can I tell you
That I love love love you
Baby how much can I tell you
That I love love love you

Baby how much can I tell you
That I love love love you

Carried gold
More than he could handle
More than he could hold

It weighed him down
To a sand shallowed grave
Where his bones were eaten
By a heat wave

While here it rains all night

Think, I'll call you up
And say, ""Please, baby, please""

I love you, I love you
Yeah, I love you
Yeah, I love you

Ah, the dream machine
Makes it hard to see
If I could stand outside myself
And watch it come to me

I'd make the dream
Filter down to my fingers
And rip at the fools head
And follow your scent that lingers

'Cause I love you
Yeah, I love you
I love you
Yeah, I love you

'Til the crash
And the booming of the white bomb
Come sure, come soon
Come leave just one song

One song, one beat
One dust, one end, one for all
One stone for the marking
For the dream when it falls

Let me tell ya now
Uh-huh
(Mmhhmmm)

When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)

(I want you back)
Yes I do now

Ooh ooh baby
(I want you back)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(I want you back)
Na na na na

Trying to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl I didn't even want around

Let me tell ya now
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go

i want you,common,Already processed,"Once the love was strong
Now it's long, long gone
'Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holding on
'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you

I've been thinking 'bout, I've been thinking 'bout
I've been thinking 'bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love, feel I need another dose
I know it's a feeling that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl, it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice, where did the king go wrong?
Emotions that, that they linger on
I guess 'cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls, I need your warm
The taste of your mouth, girl, I need your warm
Good food and love, I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer so I'm a keep dreaming on

It's kind of like 'The Breakup' with Jen and Vince Vaughn

Once the love was strong
Now it's long, long gone
'Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holding on
'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you

'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you

They say you don't know, know, know what you got
'Til what you got is gone
Yeah, I like such and such, yo' a lot but the feeling's not as strong
We were like two birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasn't able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you, my God
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess it's only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you

A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you

Once the love was strong
Now it's long, long gone
'Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holding on

'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you
'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you

We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way 'cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it, I never hid

The love that I wrote on the mirror, it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say, girl, you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun we can sing this together

'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you
'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you"

The girl has found another and gone away
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying
Crying when I go outside
To the world outside my tears
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain
Let it rain, let it rain
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
Oh, let it rain
I'm a man and I got my pride
Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain"

Przechowuje w głowie jasny portret twój i tysiąc slow
A kiedyś ci powiem, że (I'm in love with...)

A rozum chce je zagłuszyć i mówić za nie
Nie czas na racjonalność, to zbrodnia emocje tłumić
A mi jak Skaldom wszystko mówi, że (I'm in love with...)
Nawet jeśli w tej minucie tylko
A jutro obudzimy się obok, wiedząc, że noc to było wszystko
I nic, nikogo nie win za to, bo do miłości
Nie potrzeba czasu a namiętności
I jeśli to jednak start, choć nie umiem myśleć o jutrze
Wiem, że jutro tez chce budząc się widzieć twój uśmiech
Choć pewnie łóżko będzie puste, serce pełne
Całuję twoje zdjęcie (I'm in love with...)

Miłość dla mnie to huśtawka, która stoi w równowadze
Bo chce cię z każdą wada nic nie zmienię
Mój narkotyku, mój tlenie
Nie jestem sam kiedy bębny grają, to kłamstwo
Bo potrzebuje ciebie, jesteś moją inspiracją
Jedno dno, brak intryg, pułapek, brak gier, brak masek
Ty śpisz ja się patrzę, słuchaj, to ważne
Zostań tu ja ci włączę

Dowiesz się więcej, czemu znikam
Na długie dni i czym dla mnie jest muzyka
Wiem, ze słowa maja moc, której należy się szacunek
Ale gdy mówię, wszechświecie uwierz mi, wiem co mówię
32 wersy nigdy wcześniej, nic później
Bo ja kocham a nie mówię (I'm in love with...)

A nie załatwia się spraw wciąż się kłócąc
Uciekając w świat brawur, wciągając dym w płuco
Jestem świadom swoich wad, ale ty tez popatrz w lustro
Jeśli dni te trafił szlag, nie łudź się, nie wrócą

Hoping what you need is behind every door
Each time you get hurt, I don't want you to change
Because everyone has hopes, you're human after all

Feeling as though you never belong
This feeling is not sadness, this feeling is not joy
I truly understand, please don't cry now
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you, please, please don't leave here
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel
The world is just illusion trying to change you
Being like you are, well, this is something else
Who would comprehend? But some that do lay claim
Divine purpose blesses them, that's not what I believe
And it doesn't matter anyway
A part of your soul ties you to the next world
Or maybe to the last but I'm still not sure
But what I do know is to us the world is different
As we are to the world, I guess you would know that
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you, please, please don't leave here
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel
The world is just illusion trying to change you
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you, please, oh please don't leave here
I don't want you to change for all the hurt that you feel
This world is just illusion always trying to change you
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you, please, please don't leave here
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel

There is no one compares with you

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Let it be right for belief and denial
To share a space in the heart
And leave us only to imagine
About the things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

Make me pretend
Make me expect
Things can go and come to pass
Without trial or tribulation

Let this life space and time
Leave my body with permanent marks
Faded scars and lines
But not a single impression
Of the things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

Let me be tempted
Let me be torn
But make my thoughts pure and not
Morally corrupt in form

Let us sleep tonight
Let innocence lie in our dreams and secret hearts
With burning desire
A need to know and do
The things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

She's lying still but she's not dead
Awakens slowly, sees a picture of herself
On the wall as she gets up
Straightens her dress and calls me up
She says: 'I know now, I am whole now. Can you come?'

In your room
Where both of you are talking
Your good side and your bad
Discussing who has better hair
In your space
I hear four feet walking
And there are two more knocking
In case you're wondering
I'm still on your side

As she embraces all of me
I want her only to need me
It doesn't matter what I tell her because she changes
Her mind before she speaks
And tends to talk before she thinks
But how I love her

I know there's truth for you somewhere
If I were wise I'd take you there
But I'm not, at least not yet
So I'll be watching you instead
In your room, in your room

In your room
I can wander around forever
And I recognize the color of the walls that we painted
In your chair
That I broke because I was careless
I can sit and watch you dance around
My words are spoken
I am on your side
My words are spoken I am on your side
In your room..."

Just give me fifty thousand lire for my thoughts

When you eat no one else does but you always wonder why
Always wonder why
It would take a gunshot just to clear your head awhile
And after all this time how can you stand there
Look at me and smile?

And you and I are set in motion
Every fear disappears
Like a tear into an ocean

Say my name just the same
Like a flame slowly burning
Fill my eyes with the sight
Of all that lies beyond the yearning

Baby there is nothing but surrender left in me

All at once our worlds collided
I ain't strong enough to hide
I've fallen, darling
I long to take each breath beside you
Burn down all the nights before you
Slipped your hand in mine and swore to reveal it
The secret that lets me be the one inside you

If there exists a deeper bliss
Plant a kiss that wakes the morning
Reach for me, sweet as sin
You took me in against the warnings

So I will love you everyday until my days are done

All at once our worlds collided
I ain't strong enough to hide
I've fallen, darling,
I long to take each breath beside you
Burn down all the nights before you
Slipped your hand in mine and swore to reveal it

A mission probe into the unknowing
We send a seed to a distant future
Then we can watch the galaxies growing

This ain't no time for hiding your care

You see the stars are moving so slowly
But still the earth is moving so fast
Can't you see the moon is so lonely
She's still trapped in the pain of the past

This is the time of kingdoms falling
This is the time of the worlds dividing

Send your precious love into some distant time

There's no religion but time and motion
There's no religion, just tribal scars
Throw a pebble in and watch the ocean
See the ripples vanish in the distance

It's just the same in every instance
There's no religion but the joys of rhythm
There's no religion but the rites of spring
There's no religion in the path of hate

Feeling like you didn't be done
Here it comes, strawberry sponge
Chasing away the sun

It's just a candy colored frown
You were going on at half-past seven
Now it's going on a quarter 'til nine
All the angels want to know
Are you lost or treading water?
And you're going on your fifteenth bender
But you've only got a matter of time
Yes we've all got seeds to sow
Not everyone's got lambs to slaughter
When the night wind starts to turn
Into the ocean breeze
And the dew drops sting and burn
Like angry honey bees
That is when you hear the song falling from the sky
Happy yesterday to all
We were born to die
Sometimes you're filled with the notion
The afterlife's a moment away
You want to tell someone the way that you feel
But then you ain't got nothing to say
You fight for freedom from devotion
A battle that will always begin
With somebody giving you a piece of advice;
By the way you're living in sin
Now there's never gonna' be an intermission
But there'll always be a closing night
Never entertain those visions
Lest you may have packed your baggages
First impressions are cheap ambitions
Sometimes are long goodbyes
Truth so often to living dormant
Good luck walks and bullshit flies
When the headlights guide your way
You know the place is right
When the treetops sing and sway
Don't go to sleep tonight
That is when you see the sign
Luminous and high:
Tomorrow's not what it used to be
We were born to die
Happy yesterday to all
We were born to die"

intro,dave matthews band,Already processed,"This is Dave è strano dirlo
L'ho detto sottovoce ora lo grido convinto
Chiuso versi in uno scrigno i testi chiavi per aprirlo
Mi son giocato tutto anche se non ho mai vinto
Ho Seguito l'istinto non mi servono le prove
A me bastano gli indizi questa è la prova del nove
Forse è l'ego che mi ha spinto a cercare la soluzione
Per essere me stesso ma una versione migliore
Nulla accade per errore ma non ci credo al destino
Credo solo alla biro ad ogni giorno che vivo
L'obbiettivo nel mirino finché mi manca il respiro
Forse c'è la faccio ma meglio non dirlo in giro
Non ho mai pregato ma forse mi piacerebbe
Aver qualcuno che mi ascolta e fare parte del suo gregge
Qualcuno che mi consiglia è quando sbaglio mi corregge
Che alla fine della strada mi aspetterà a braccia aperte
Si quando mi piacerebbe ma qui non si fa vedere
È con la fede solo il prete sai ci si paga le cene
È quelli che ci guardano dall'alto sono iene
So che non fidarsi è meglio ma anche che fidarsi è bene
La prendo come viene a volte è meglio non pensarci
Sono passati anni fa quasi stano guardarci
Che nonostante tutto siamo diventati grandi
Ci hanno spinto nel vuoto senza nemmeno avvisarci

Se avessi un'occasione
Tu non la sfrutteresti
Se avessi un'altra opzione
Sicuro la sceglieresti
Se avessi un'opinione
Sei certo che la che la diresti
Avessi la tua attenzione
Si Forse mi capiresti
Entra nel mio mondo anche se forse non dovresti
Entra nella mia testa poi dimmi cosa ne pensi

Ho imparato a godermi il volo Stringo i denti nervi tesi
Per avere ciò che cerchi sai basta che non lo chiedi
A vederci in foto sembriamo quasi sereni
Ma cosa penso davvero da quanto non me lo chiedi
Volevi le risposte a domande che non puoi farmi
Vorrei accontentarti ma non so dove trovarle
Scusa non posso fidarmi forse è meglio se non parli
Le parole sono armi meglio se sai come usarle
Forse dovrei accontentarmi scordarmi dell'ambizione
D'essere migliore anche se so che non basta
Ma non riesco a addormentarmi Di pensieri ne ho un milione
Che nascondo tra le note sopra ad un pezzo di carta
È per oggi mi basta e mi è sempre bastato
Spero il peggio sia passato e quello che è stato è stato
Ancora non capivo quanto fossi fortunato
Ad avere un un motivo per essere motivato
Sono sempre lo stesso e tutto il resto che è cambiato
Accendi il motore ed allacciati la cintura
No non me ne vado sono appena arrivato
È se finisce male beh me la sono voluta
Preferisco ancora il rischio tu tieniti il posto fisso
Aiutati da solo che qua nessuno ti aiuta
È scusa il cinismo resto pure se fallisco
Questo non è un disco è una promessa mantenuta

Se avessi un'occasione

intro,dj shadow,Already processed,"In the twilight of a time
There emerges a need for man to comprehend his own bitter fate
Finally resigned to the inevitable beyond, he searches the ages
Desperate for stories of assurance, redemption and hope
Such tales fill page upon page with enough ink
To flood a thousand valleys, and drown the tallest tree
But there is one tale that as yet been told
The story of... The Outsider

Desolate and baron, humanities at a crossroads
The people have retreated shuttering their once carefree lives
From unseen enemies which seem to plague not only
The physical form but the innermost thought
Driven by panic, compelled by dread
The masses begin to devolve
Once dear neighbours turn wary foes
Brother against brother, sister against sister
Achievement and ambition are dismissed
As heretical, or worse, treasonous
Even nature itself is scorned
Choked with suspicion and fear, voices do not dare to sing
Nor fingers to play, imminent defeat is all but assured

But in the darkest hour
Whispers begin to tell of a figure emerging from the darkness
A being without a name, faceless and obscure
Part presence, part idea they say
As if the very force they describe has existed for eons
A dormant seed awaiting nourishment word of radical acts...
Disobedience, non-compliance spread among the people
At first fearful, then defiant, as the legend grows
Whispers turned to cries and the cries into screams
And tend to cower no more the fury of the people
Whose talent behold as they exact revenge on their captors
Spare neither the repentant nor the bold
Now the fire is lit, smouldering in the belly of humanity
It cannot be extinguished, for the stories The Outsider endure
Even as evidence of its presence is debated with the passing years
Messages, dictations, warnings, stories, such as these..."

Nah, I'm just kidding witch'all

Then he hold me slightly tightly
Mom, your wish came true, I got one just like me

I wake up every mornin' in the canopy bed
Slip a kiss to the miss, you the man she says
Mirror, mirror, need I call? You know, who know, bad breath and all
Times I been fed up, still didn't let up
'Stead a doin' dirt, did work and kept my head up, set up
For the future, much love to my girl
North pole got my butt, cold sittin' on top of the world

And I'm feelin', touch the ceilin'
You say, I smile 'cause I'm on top of the pie
But yo, the cream can only finance the smile for a little while
My grin got longevity, got family backin' me
That's why I'm livin' happily, ever after, love and laughter
Hustle 'cause I wants to, not 'cause I have to
Ask yourself, who made the polar caps melt?
F P the phenomenon, true Don Vuan, Jon Blaze
The fonz ain't seen my happy days
The track plays, I'm in the shades, singin' a phrase

Take my hand, watch me freak this
Hot mommy's tryin' to creep this sleep with this
Tryin' to entice me to let it off
But na, come on baby you saw set it off
Proposition by trio, in Rio
Menage trios down at the Mardi grass
But na, my clothes by Versace
Attitude cocky, the scent Isimiaki
Like a felon, no tellin' what I do next
I don't front 'cause I'm paid, but I do flex
South western crib like a Villa

Every night I dream of you a part of me inside

When you came around I couldn't get over loving you

'Cause you are beautiful
Your scars are beautiful
Like the jade
You'll still shine, when you sink into the sea
When the bleeding scarlet jealousy
Carves the way you believe

Brink of the light, the wings of the night
Look into the eyes of fallen angels
Sink like a stone into the dark
Where no light can touch

Will God break my fall?
I feel the mystery, tries to take me along
To the end of the world, where I still believe
The colour is from your eyes

'Cause you were beautiful
Your blood was beautiful, yesterday
I still hide at the seam of memories
Oh, I still hold my rosary, beneath the pain of life

Where all the tears, when the bloody face of love
They take away the stain
Know that the stars of the sky
Glowed in the ocean, the art of life
Makes me wanna die
In the colour of heaven

Oh, another day has gone
Another friend has gone
Into the flame
It's burning now
自分で切り裂いた 胸の傷痕さえ
綺麗になるまで

Oh, 'cause you are beautiful
Your scars are beautiful, like the jade
You'll still shine, when you sink into the sea
When the bleeding scarlet jealously carves the way you believe

Now and forever, you'll be loved
Let your destiny lead your heart

The fact that we're white isn't why we're friends
But we are white, and we're friends (In Japan!)

At this point in the video we'll be super drunk (WEEEE!)
Standing near some kind of Dragon (Rawwwrrr!)
And then we'll buy some stinky used girls panties
Out of one of those pervert vending machines (heehee)
Now we've seen sumo wrestling live (Cool!)
Unless we get dropped by our label

Cause we're three white douchebags in Japan (That's us!)
It's all part of our master plan
To get some much needed R&R
At the expense of Universal Records

It's called Yen

I've been waitin' to tell you this for oh-so-long
And these feelings I have deserves to be in a song
I wish I could just squeeze you 'til you was out of breath
Grab you by your neck and choke you half to death
Wish I could kick you in your ass without going to jail
Or lock you in a trunk without creating a smell
If only for one night, I could take you by your hand
And cut that ho off, while it's still in the heart of a man
If we could sail across the sea, just you and me, in a boat
I'd throw your ass overboard and just look at you float
I'll glue your eyes wide open, have you roped in the kitchen
Take a picture of my nuts, so you can see what 'cha missin'!
Take a walk on the beach, bury your body with sand
And keep packin' and packin' until you couldn't
Withstand
Get a hotel suite, 20 stories above
And chunk you out the window, see you fly like a dove

Tie to you to a motorcycle, start jumpin' ramps, doin' donuts
I'll take you climbin' to the mountaintop
Trip you and watch you drop from rock to rock
Only you can make me feel this way, mayne there's no other
But you had to find another lover or whatever
And I really wish you happiness, I hope it work out
So y'all can get a crib together, so I can blow up your house
I put my ring in your mouth, I put my foot in his rectum
Ain't hatin', but if he's takin 'from me, I ain't gonna' respect 'im

I got the Kool-Aid
I hear the
something from my baby
I wade out to the ocean
Put on my sunset lotion
I see the sun glow
The water flow in slow motion
I got a beach chair
I see the blonde hair
Pick up my feet there
I feel the cool air
The breeze is nice now
I'll tell you right now
I sip my Kool-Aid
Boy I'm feeling better now
Do I need a vacation?
Just need to get away for a while
Wait, did I forget my sunglasses?
No
Got 'em
I paint my nails pink
There in the sand dome
I hear the oh-so calling on the radio
I see a young boy
He on the upswing
He gets a nose bleed
And I hear the girls sing
I hop on the water slide
Gotta get my swims on
I pull my straps up
I'll see your better slides

Look at the seashells
I see the young boys swimming"

Gotta take what you can these days
There's so much ahead
So much regret

knight moves,suzanne vega,Already processed,"Watch while the queen
In one false move
Turns herself into a pawn
Sleepy and shaken
And watching while the blurry night
Turns into a very clear dawn

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love many, can you love one,
Do you love me?

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love twenty, can you love one,
Do you love me?

One false move
And a secret prophecy
Well, if you hold it against her,
First hold it up and see
That it's one side stone
One side fire
Standing alone among all men's desire
They want to know

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love many, can you love one,
Do you love me?

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love twenty, can you love one,
Do you love me?

And if you wonder
What I am doing
As I am heading
For the sink
I am spitting out all the bitterness
Along with half of my last drink
I am thinking
Of your woman
Who is crying in the hall
It's like drinking gasoline
To quench a thirst
Until there's nothing there left at all

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love many, can you love one,
Do you love me?

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love twenty, can you love one,
Do you love me?

""Walk on her blind side""
Was the answer to the joke
It's said there isn't a political bone
In her body
She would rather be a riddle
But she keeps challenging the future
With a profound lack of history

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love many, can you love one,
Do you love me?

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love twenty, can you love one,
Do you love me?

Can you shit on me? I just want you to shit on me, Obie

Chorus: Eminem
Hey lady, hey darling, hey baby, I'm sorry
(I don't think you really wanna be my girl)
But I can't be, your boyfriend if you toy with my mothafuckin' emotions
(Fucking with me could be dangerous)
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fucking for real, I'll make you suffer
(You never know what I may really be like in real life)
Like I suffered, if you fuck me, don't make me fall in love
(I'm the type, that might flip and get a little bit crazy)

Verse 1: Obie Trice
Baby I'm extra large (huge) in magnitude
And Magnums the lubrication that I use
To chose which hole on a ho I abuse
Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who
When I fuck the shit out you, then the next day (bitch)
I'll rush the shit out you off my two-way (ooh wait)
You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's
Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own
No, I'm in and out your home
And this in, and out your tone
I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
Put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around
I bounce 'em around, camcord the sex
And sell 'em around town, how that sound?
If I was in love with ya, now you wanna clown?
Fuck with them clowns until I pound on your crown
Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
You don't want it with me, you just horny as me
You want a nut, nothing but what it should be

Verse 2: Eminem
I'm internationally known baby but actually
There are few people who know how I am naturally
All you know is that I can act irrationally
When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV
So they label me this crazed loony rap bully
But truthfully that ain't the truth and if you believe
In that shit then you'll believe anything's true
And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally
But personally that actually works for me
Cause the last thing that I need's a string attached to me
I'm a bachelor, bitch, and I ain't in no fast fury
To run out and find a new Mrs. Mathers
Cause see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully
But we do still make booty calls occasionally
But be damned if I end up back in that pattern
And we end up back at that god damn tavern
And having another déjà vu, we seeing security
Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry
I got news for you bitch, your new curfew's early
You ain't home by 2:30, [gunshot], you heard me?

Chorus: Eminem
Hey lady, hey darling, hey baby, I'm sorry
(I don't think you really wanna be my girl)
But I can't be, your boyfriend if you toy with my mothafuckin' emotions
(Fucking with me could be dangerous)
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fucking for real, I'll make you suffer
(You never know what I may really be like in real life)
Like I suffered, if you fuck me, don't make me fall in love
(I'm the type, that might flip and get a little bit crazy)

Verse 3: Obie Trice
See you looking at the life, you looking at the lights
You looking at the ice, you ain't looking at the Trice
You should look at some advice when I say he ain't nice
Despite the fact you think you the feisty type
O love to fight, I love the drama
Love when my bitch get to cussing out Yolanda (fuck you, bitch!)
Find the Obie condom on the counter
Swinging her weave, can't breathe like I can't believe!
Least I ain't deceive and try to mislead
And sell a dream just to get you on my team
I came clean to keep down the beef
Keep down my reach, you can keep all your teeth, sweety

Verse 4: Eminem
See what we do under the covers
Should stay between the covers
And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage
On the front page cover of Us as new lovers
But this is when a bitch get to showing her true colors
Cause the truth of it, everything that I do's public
And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends
Guess who you just screwed
As soon as me and you've done it
And save the used rubber to show 'em the proof of it
I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
But you better be careful of who you're doing it to
Cause you never know when the shoe could end up
On the other foot and it backfires on you
Cause you may think you want it
Then you want me, til you get me
Then you got me and you're fucked
'Cause you'll be stuck with me
For the rest of your life cause if I get attached to you
We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you
You'll be walking out the house and I'll run up and tackle you
Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you
You don't think you're leaving this house in that, do you?
Not 'til I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you
And have you walking out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters
Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather
Front on me? Never cause we gon' be together forever
Right, bitch? Right, bitch?

Chorus: Eminem
Hey lady, hey darling, hey baby, I'm sorry
(I don't think you really wanna be my girl)
But I can't be, your boyfriend if you toy with my mothafuckin' emotions

They never leave her

That you will cry in spite of you

Little wet tears on your baby's shoulder

And I have walked these streets so long
There ain't nothing right, there ain't nothing wrong
But the little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
The little wet tears on your baby's shoulder

Lady lights a cigarette, puffs away, no regret
Takes a look around, no regrets, no regrets
Stretches out like branches of a poplar tree
She says, i'm free
Sings so soft as if she'll break, says
I can sing this song so blue
That you will cry in spite of you
Little wet tears on your baby's shoulder
Little wet tears on your baby's shoulder

I have walked these streets so long
There ain't nothing right, nothing wrong
But the little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
The little wet tears on your baby's shoulder

But on this stage
I've learned to fly
Learned to sing
And learned to cry
Little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
Little wet tears on my baby's shoulder

But now it's time

You'll find another life to live

I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give

I know you'll get over it

So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you

And every time that you're lonely
Every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know

I know your hope is heavy but
You'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it

And I know you feel like everything
Is falling to the wind
But don't you let the thunder in
Cause I know you'll get over it

So when you're caught in a landslide

And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you

And every time that you're lonely
Every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know

You fell down by the wayside
Love locked in an overflow
And you threw stones at the starlight
Cause I stood on the sidelines telling you

That I get that you're lonely
And I see that you feel alone
But I heard in a heartbeat
I'll be there here for you, you know

So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Well, I've been afraid of changing 'cause I've
Built my life around you
Time makes you bolder
Even children get older

last kiss,taylor swift,Already processed,"I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July 9th, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing but for you I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss

Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss

Never imagined we'd end like this

Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss

Forever the name on my lips

Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last"

They built a world outside

When I dragged crippled legs
Through long winding streets
Fell on knee with suffering
And the people would see right through me"

And it's very slowly picking me apart
I've tried to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart

Now just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thought's your keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Sie sagten: Laura, wieso hast du jetzt 'nen schwarzen Mann?
Der hat bestimmt schon 20 Kinder und 'nen Drogenproblem,
Wir wollen dich nicht in der Zukunft in 'nem Wohnblock seh'n!

Sie fragen mich nach meinem Beruf, ich sage, ich mach' Sprechgesang.
Sie fragen nach dem Schulabschluss, ich sage, ich bin Rapper, man!
Die Mutter zuckt mit dem Kopf, weil sie es nicht besser kann
Sie fragt mich kurz darauf nach meiner Zukunft und dem Kontostand.

Tut mir Leid, dass ich kein Cappuccino oder Wein trink'.
Tut mir Leid, dass meine Hosen leider etwas zu weit sind.
Tut mir Leid, dass ich nicht auf fein Essen gehen steh'.
10-Gänge-Menü, aber nichts auf dem Teller seh'.

Es ist alles nur Zeitverschwendung,
Es liegt nur an deinen Eltern.
Ich bin nicht der Grund!

Sie wollen mich nicht als Schwiegersohn!

Listen to me...
Jetzt steh' ich hier vor euch, so wie Gott mich schuf.
Und ich frag' mich, sind wir nicht alle gleich?
Warum darf ich diese Frau nicht lieben?
Ist es, weil ich schwarz bin?
Say: Hell no! Say: Hell no!

Seitdem wir zwei zusammen sind herrscht bei dir nur Chaos,
Deine Mutter ist verwirrt und nennt mich ständig Carlos.
Für sie sind wir alle gleich, haben kein Ziel vor Augen.
Wir klauen nur ihre Kinder und woll'n sie versauen.

Tut mir Leid, dass ich manchmal etwas unrasiert bin,
Tut mir Leid, dass mit mir euer Familienbild nicht stimmt.
Tut mir Leid, dass ich nicht Boss oder Guci Sachen trage,
Ist schon arm, dass dein Prada-Papa mich deshalb nicht mag.

Sie fragen mich, ob ich studier', ich sag', na klar, seit Jahren schon!
Die Straße, den Bezirk und die Leute, wo ich wohn'.
Sie sagen nichts - kurze Stille - okay, das war's jetzt wohl.

Well, in simple english I'm lazy, I wanna be lazy,
I long to be out in the sun, with no work to be done.
Under that awning they call the sky,
Stretching and yawning, and let the world go drifting by,
I wouldn't peep through the deep tangled wildwood, counting sheep,
'Till I sleep like a child would,
With a great big valise full of books to read, where it's peaceful.
While I'm killin' time, being lazy.
Wrong number, wrong number.
Oh Sam, you're sweet!

Resentment remain
Both east and west
Police expect
An arrest

In despair
Recoiling from the slaughter

They're raising an army

From York Minster
To the Firth of Forth
A pilgrimage of grace
You won't believe it
Such a human face
When you receive it
And you will
Get over it
With time to kill
You'll get over it

There's a cruiser waiting
At Scapa Flow
To take you away
From all you know
The old man agonised
He really has compromised

Public opinion
May not be on your side
There are those who think
They've been taken for a ride
You'll get over it
I'm on your side because
You'll get over it
And what a ride it was!

Has been on the phone
He wants to upgrade
The mobile you own
Have you realised
Your computer's a spy?

Shorn of your freedom

Twenty minutes long

Lower the standards
To half their mast
Let's toast the future
With a shotgun blast

Masses arise, war is nigh
We are legion
Bombers in the sky rain fire

Tourists in tanks, join the ranks
Of resistance
Clemency denied in the land

Seems much too high

The ink is fading
The future dims

And got love in father's singing

They got engaged, they were inflamed
Seduced by the like of butterflies
How they shimmer, how they glimmer
Those butterflies

We seven kids, we almost died
Nearly put to death
By a lightning strike
Instead there was hot pink
Flashes in the sky
We climbed the rocks in snow and rain
In search of magic power

To heal our mother's pain

Shot a rabbit from the back seat window

The sugar in your tea
The knock upon your backdoor
The twist that turns your key
Am I the sweat you feel on your head
The shadow on your face
The tune inside your head that put you here in the first place
Well I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be your sweet temptation
I don't want to be your new sensation
It's just a delicate distraction
With just a hint of satisfaction
Look me in the eye and let me know
If you can't love me that let me go
Let me go
Let me go

Do you try to stay suspended
In your deepest fantasy
After night has ended
The scent of mystery
The power of suggestion
Tangles up your soul
A neutral state between love and hate
Is bound to take its toll
Well I don't think you know
I don't think you know
I don't think you know about the screaming
You don't understand the meaning
You could trade it in for laughter
To keep your happy ever after
Look me in the eye and let me know
If you can't love me then let me go
Let me go
Let me go

Baby in your ivory tower
Do you sleep tight dream fight
Baby does it wet your appetite
Maybe in your darkest hour
Am I the keeper of your beast

And bring back the **** who was livest

Old hustlers, reminiscing on better days
They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers, one foot in the grave
They used to love us till we found our own way thru the maze

Got the West Coast laughing, now Esco's asking
What happened? My homegirl from upper Manhattan
She remembers the quarters that's Latin, a lotta rat-a-tat-tatting

Not manned-a-wanno like the parents of Lionel
Nas is the Ghetto American Idol
No matter what you do you're never getting my title

I can't sound smart' cuz ya'll'll run away
They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about 'ye
Like there's no other way for a ex-hustler
Cake ya, the X-ray splitter to touch ya, I beg to differ

When you're four years into the game, we can have a conversation
Eight years in the game, I invite you on vacation
Ten years in the game, after I've enjoyed my fame
Only then I let ya pick my brain

And I, they don't really see, I don't even deal with all that garbage

You can do nothin with me, like weed with too many seeds in it
I'm more - vicious, it gets - more pathetic
You testin somethin more than a medic nigga or mortician
I'm more than rap, I will RUSH you
For the sacks like Warren Sapp, like nigga FUCK you
I'll STUFF you in a Atlanta mansion
Paint the wall with you on ""Candid Camera,"" like I'm a phantom answered
Demand a ransom; cause a fire at your momma's house
And take all of the tires off of the ambulances
Of course the track, fits Mr. King

They beat and break

When you run away from harm
Will you run back into my arms?
Like you did when you were young
Will you come back to me?

Bad times give you something to talk about
The next time you feel you're all worn out
Remember life is a story
Don't you doubt
It only takes a day for everything to turn around

Love is a story they tell to you
But the way they tell it ain't quite true
You'll wake up one day and you're twenty-two
You know love is just a story that they tell to you
Love takes a lot of work like everything else you're Gonna do

Friends are just the people that you can talk with
Somebody to talk about that somebody to talk About this
But everyone changes and forever is a myth
Friends are just the people that you can talk with
A lot of them'll leave but only a few you're gonna Miss

School is the place where I did my growing
They fill your brain to overflowing
They tell you this is all stuff you need to be knowing
School is the place where I did my growing
Just when I got to like it it was time to be going

The world is the place where it all happens
They draw lines on it and call it a map
In between every line's a different flag flapping
The world is the place where it all happens
Six billion people all taking turns eating in a napkin

Animals are critters just like you and me
The only difference is that they don't worry
About things that they can't smell or see
Animals are critters just like you and me

I listen to yours and you listen to mine

Songs are just something to waste your time
So is everything else to do whatever makes you feel Fine

God's just a story someone made up long ago
Before they had books and tv shows
I don't believe in him and I ain't afraid to say so
You know god's just a story someone made up long Ago
But it's hard not to be superstitious despite all you Know

Everyone's born and everyone dies
Everyone has a time and wonders why
The ocean's blue so is the sky
Everyone's born and everyone dies
The old lady cries, the new baby cries... and sighs

Kisses are weird but they can be fun
Instead of shaking hands it's like shaking tongues
I wish I got to do it more when I was young
Kisses are weird but they can be fun
I hate going once a month without kissing anyone

At this point it's been since uh... how many months
1 2 3 4 5 6... 7
I think if kissing someone could make them Pregnant
The last person I kissed would have had their kid by Now

*Snort laugh snort*

Dreams are weird but they can be fun too
They happen more often than kisses it's true
In some I was naked and in some I flew
Dreams are weird but they can be fun too
I wonder if you're dreaming about me when I'm Dreaming about you

Now that you heard everything I said
There ain't nothing new inside your head
If you want, disregard it all go ahead
Now that you've heard everything I said
There are probably one or two things you coulda Been doing instead

And he's playing the part of a modern guy
All his time spent thinking
And praying like it's going out of style
God is just a rock like her
And you and me and Jesus
Can she feel the boundaries we make up?
It's time for everyone to see

Stare into the mirror
And it's all I can do to keep laughing
And feeling fine
Should we need to stand out?
Oh no.

Everybody's got a story
A sad, sad story
It's a short walk down
Stop playing along
And then it goes away
And this one takes no brain

So we can stop talking now
Insane, I know, but we can be quiet
And take the silent ride
Do you shake with sweating hands
When the part goes ""...""
Or smile undercover?

Couldn't wait for the chance to raise your eyes
Ride around on tales and won't you please tell me what you believe?
We can say anything that we feel
But it isn't this
This has no name

Everything you feel
As everyone creates you cannot be real
So excited because you've done so well
And we say:
This one takes no name
This is just the page
This is the field"

With places I have never been
Hoping for a blackout to save me
But electricity keeps flowing
And I surrender

You go straight down to the water

little brother,black star,Already processed,"Yeah (doin' this song for you)
The revolution will not be televised or broadcast live on the net (to all my little brothers)
My man Mos said it's personal (out in the street)
Know what I'm sayin'? (Strugglin' to survive)
It's gotta start from right up in here, ya know what I'm sayin'?
(Keep your eyes on the prize, you know)

Ya can't stop, you know
Ya can't stop, you know
Ya can't stop, you know
Ya can't stop when we rep

We rep the ain't-gots
Ain't nobody can't start
No party like us, we crush the faint hearts
From Hallsey to St. Mark's

Walk in the main blocks painted with blood that's still hot
So deep it stain socks
The pain spark frustration, situations lead to hatin'
Some deal with drug distribution, others walk the plantation

Some know the code o' the streets, some got a college education
Come down on the weekend and peep the conversation (yo)
On the corner, units stormed out
Ghetto-lookin' bombed out

Police waited to roll – for those who walk the wrong route
Shorties goin' all out, they got they swords drawn out
Ready to brawl out, gettin' fought 'til they fall out
Black like Morehouse, 40 O's is tossed out

For brothers that they mourn 'bout, get wrecked 'til it's dawn out
Whether they broke or flossed out, honeys pass they draws out
Lookin' for a ticket out the poor-house
A jungle out here, lions keep they claws out, fangs and jaws out

Weak just get forced out
Names is called out, ghetto fame is sought out
You wanna be the man that they talk 'bout, I walked out
I had some things on my mind to sort out

I thought 'bout the wild circumstance we born out
Remember myself at your age and I was just like you
If that was now, I don't know what I would do
My answer's closest to me

So what I say to you is goin' for me
Son we both still growin' indeed
But where you at, I was and where you been, I left
Utilize my experience to guide ya step

Some people get love but don't command respect
It's somethin' that you can't ride wit' a check
Over-rollin' your lex or icy links that hang from your neck
If it's real, who need to deal with the special effects? (Come here, come here yo)

Let me drop this on ya, look they got you cornered
The corner of the block is hot, I ain't got to warn ya
'Cause I see you every day, trapped in every way
And shit, I'm a thug, and that's all that I can say

Who are you anyway?
Mary J.? I spend, many nights awake (uh)
Watchin' you while you sleep (word)
Tryna figure out how to be the example, 'cause talk is cheap

As you – walk the streets, study cats on the real
In a convo, just make your point to relax and chill
Niggas wanna destroy each other in a cypher instead of build
Be a – man of will, don't be – standin' still

If you – don't plan ahead, then you – plan to fail
Those be – in a daze when the ways reveal
Like they funny style but I'm not laughin'
Serious niggas makin' money while the police is passin'
Can't wait for opportunity to knock, you gotta make it happen
It ain't about no spectacular ways of rappin'
Just immaculate ways of action, dig
Little Brother
I know that times is hard
Keep your mind on guard
Stay clear of things that are harmin'

You'll get along
I sing my song
For little brothers
Out there in the street

Strugglin' to make ends meet
Gotta hold the heat
Strugglin' so hard to compete
Stay clear of things that harm

And stayin' wit' y'all
Try to stay strong
Keep movin' on
Keep movin' on

Keep movin' on
Keep movin' on
Keep movin' on

locust,the drones,Already processed,"Georgie, i can't stop drinking
Seems like every time i try i can't stop thinking
Georgie, when i was a boy
I would stand there in the shade
Of a wedding cake hotel doorway
Watching sister with her liquor in a jar
Talk to older boys in cars.

Ether was the town where i was born
They pulled iron from the ground
And knife wounds from the port
They built a prison and it tempered in the sun
It rose up off a plateau like the last tooth in a gum
You went there by train and you would never be the same.

They made the blacks live outside of town
The weekend come they'd tear the whole place down
Chinese came without weekends at all
And the whites complained the pay was better
Shooting them in the war
Home may be where the calm blinds
But i could see that they weren't lying.

My first girls old man was in a later war
He drank like a motherfucker, now i know what for
She took my van, put louie in the jack
Left a suicide not and i've got him to thank for that
And he can thank our statesmen hosts
Although his chances are remote

Georgie, i can't stop drinking
Seems like every time i try i can't stop thinking
Georgie, when i was a boy
I would stand there in the shade
Of a wedding cake hotel doorway
Watching sister with her liquor in a jar
Talk to older boys in cars."

That no one can understand

And lived to walk away I slept all night on a bed on nails
Ive walked bare feet on a fire trail
Ive felt hot needles under my skin
Since you went away Chorus
Dont forget me I once lived to see your smile
Take a moment and add this to your pile
This dream is over and you want a change of style
Now Ill been lonely for a while
Verse 2Ive broken through your battle lines
Tampered with the hands of time
I walked for miles under desert skies
And still Ive made no ground

Everything are puppets of madness that try to lie me
And I'm the stupid puppeteer that moves the threads of my intelligence

I need to feel living people not been programmed
Not to be pushed by their terrific look
To deeply breathe with nobody stealing the air

Than into my autistic refuge
Reality is as mad as my madness is
And the only solution is to enter again
Into my universe and dominate everything
To forget the outside
And become the almighty of the absurd [yeah!]

Real life preservation
What I'm hustling for
My name black thought
The definition of raw
I was born in South Philly
On a cement floor
I had nothing at all
Had to knuckle and brawl
They swore I'd fall
Be another brick in the wall
Another life
Full of love
That lost
That's silly
This Philly
Y'all really ain't stoppin
The boy with the pen
Like Willie
On top of the hall
Pure soul is what the city
Most popular for
Hear the tones
That will ease you
Smooth
As Bunny Sigler's soundtrack
Keepin your head boppin and all
It's something in the water
Where I come from
They used to sing it on the corner
Where I come from
Making somethin outta nothing
Because everybody fifty cents
From a quarter
Where I come from
Yeah
The streets ain't timid
But I feel at home in it
Gotta see a couple people
I ain't got at

Pressure my word

Of you chump
Stomped on a different ground

Come get high on me
Before a nine millimeter shell
Hit my pelle pelle

For crack to make it happen

Ghetto could have took me under

Never had
You don't know about me
You ain't stroll my streets
Look familiar
I feel ya
Longtime no see

Uhh
Clap somethin
But whatever you clap
Clap to the record spinnin
While I'm takin you back
To the top paper era
Baby big on that
Picture the pool room
Where the money getters was at
And street people
With feather in the cap
Or their bossolino Pullin paper
As if it's a small casino
I was a young boy
Sweepin the floors
And runnin to stores
But all those old heads
Woudl talk to me About the way
To clutch the eagle
On a buck and truck
And if I'm down
How to get back up
Just survival kid
And it's a struggle worldwide
I'm positive
Shit the ghetto might as well
Be the Gaza Strip
You know where all the monsters is
Street walkers
You don't see no consciousness I'm coming back to where
The core of the problem is
We on the job again

look away,deerhoof,Already processed,"All alone
Standing here by myself
And my girl is walking right down the street with someone else
There's not a place that I can run in a town this size

So I just better look away
I said I better look away
I said I better look away before she sees the tears in my eyes

He's so close
The girl I knew so well
With the eyes and the lips and the skin
That I know so well

I know they both want to look at me,
If I smile, that's a poor disguise

I just better look away
I said I better look away
I said I better look away before she sees the tears in my eyes

There they go, and I wonder if either one of them is wise
That when I look away
I said I when I look away
I said when I look away
Did she see the tears in my eyes?"

Well honey, I'm just trying,

And now you wanna say you see through me,
Well, what you want to see ain't your memories of me,
So I could turn around tonight, but I'm already there,

So if you see that movie star and me,
If you should see my picture in a magazine,
Or if you fall asleep while you're watching TV,
Well honey, I'm just trying,
To make some sense of Los Angeles.

Boston gets cold this time of year,
Seems like each day just leaves me numb,
I gotta get outta here and go walking in the sun.

Well honey, I'm just trying to make some sense,
Honey, I'm just trying to make some friends,

For coming to Los Angeles,
Oh, Los Angeles.

With silly pranks like you ain't gonna win kid

Fix these plans I got hopes and dreams son
Rolling down hill and the year has just begun

From this bleeding heart rolling down a bitter start

Pull my guns out shooting at the TV.

And you make a fine point
Not all city you hitting up the five points

You fake stunts that's strictly for super Dave

The antidote over these working class beats
Woke up in the pm the face is all crusty

Its such a pain when the Bullshits repetitive
So why bother even takin' these next steps
Even yesterday is harder to recollect
Muster it up and step out of the house
Take a little trip and start tearing it out

A tall order of beef is high stakes

Since childhood they've been callin you an old soul
Now bop that head its hip hop irony
For twenty sum odd years probably
Actin the same way ain't nothing really change
Mabey that internet and new heads to blame
Glimps of the future makin these toes curl
And mabey then ill stop spyin on my ex girl
In this world famous to nameless
None of it is easy and none of it is painless
Weighless on the moon watchin the earth turn

Got a new watch I got heat in the house
Got rhymes got beats no kid no spouse

As I sing in the lost voice of a stranger in love
Out of time letting go
In another world that spins around for fun

And I wonder where I am...
Could he ever ask her why?
So happy and so young
And I stare... but...

I can't find myself
I can't find myself
I can't find myself
I can't find myself

In the heart of this stranger in love
Giving up holding on
To this other under faded setting sun

And I'm not sure where I am...
Would he really turn away?
So happy and so young
And I stare
As I play out the passion of a stranger in love
Letting go of the time
In this other world that spins around for one

And I'm not sure where I am...
Would she know it was a lie?
So happy and so young
And I stare... but...

I can't find myself
I can't find myself
I can't find myself
I can't find myself

In the soul of this stranger in love
No control over one
To the other under faded setting sun

And I don't know where I am...
Should he beg her to forgive?
So happy and so young
And I stare...
As I live out the story of a stranger in love
Waking up going on
In the other world that spins around undone
And I don't know where I am...
Should she really say goodbye?
So happy and so young
And I stare... but...
I can't find myself
I can't find myself
I can't find myself
I can't find myself

The man in the blue suit's got God
Are we there yet?
The congregation's been sold off,
They've been bought

What to do about tomorrow?
Please let it come, just let it come
What you gonna do about today, man?
It's right here staring you in the face

What a difference that would make
If we were finally awake

We getting scared yet?
The man in the blue suit's got guns
Are we there yet?
The congregation's been killed off
Are we getting scared yet?
We drop our bombs to lift them up

You've gotta be out of your head!
Is it worth all the dead?
Do you like it?

Does the wife
Mind the touch
Of your reddened hand,
Or the money on your breath?
Does your balance turn her on
Regardless of the sin?

Blind your eyes watching sunbeams
You can't see this creeping pack of dogs
Blind your eyes watching sunbeams
The pure bred beasts wait licking their chops"

The future is shining like a giant metal beast.
It shines so bright tonight, with its legs open wide
And love is blind.
Falls in love with itself again, like it never should, the way it always can.
And she is mine, but the world is much bigger now
Oh tell me, should I hold her hand, and give her love,
Or take her heart and throw it far away?
Oh now is the time, to jump into it all.
I'll just hold my nose, and try not to fall.
To seek and to find, instead of walking around with eyes glued to the sky
I turn them down to the ground.
Oh and I used to think that maybe one day,
I'd find the love of my life.
Oh but it's so far away.
Oh I don't know why.
Oh but I, I want it all tonight.

We held hands, and we looked out of the bedroom window.
We could see all the buildings collapsing around us, so we kissed.
And we laid on the bed, and we waited for the ceiling to fall in.
But it never did.
In the morning it was all still there.
The spilled milk and the dog-turd,
In that grey ashtray morning light.

Oh, you take all their love, and you suck out their eyes,
And then you rip out their hearts, and you eat their insides.

From lack of love many hide, some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of actin' in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Tryna find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion, it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man, uh

Then we shall see each other face to face

And i watched this fight occur
But only thought about lovers
Oh it's strange how this world becomes pure

And you were standing on top of tip toes
In the kitchen as the water starts to boil
And as we removed each others clothes
I thought i would sing some notes
So that maybe you would slow dance with me

Everyone has something I need
Don't let me wake up & find
All those others leaving me behind

Then I'm happy to say neither have I
Although I'm not going to shrug my shoulders & suck my thumb
This time
'cause there's something I deserve
Love, just love yourself like no one else

They can say what they like but they still can't take that
Picture my house in a postcard town
Picture a bomb in the sky
History at the door who could ask for more?

So kill me with love
Just love yourself like no one else

What was normal in the evening
By the morning seems insane

And I'm not sure what the trouble was
What started all of this

Lucy gave me veil - like shaken crystal clear
When lights were turning pale - then i would still be there
Lucy shone is neon - lucy swore she's mine
And in anothes aeon - i would be the first in line"

Never knew the best was yet to come

And I hear your laugh like a serenade

How long do you wanna be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How long do you wanna to be loved?
Is forever enough
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

I slip in bed when you're asleep
To hold you close and feel your breath on me
Tomorrow there'll be so much to do
So tonight I'll drift in a dream with you

How long do you wanna be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How long do you wanna be loved?
Is forever enough
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

As you wander through this troubled world
In search of all things beautiful
You can close your eyes when you're miles away
And hear my voice like a serenade

How long do you wanna be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How long do you wanna be loved?
Is forever enough
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

How long do you wanna be love?
Is forever enough, is forever enough

lullaby,hayden,Already processed,"The long long day is through
The light's been replaced by blue
You lie awake in your room
Thinking about what to do
And everything depends
On one single chance
Should you accept this dance

The last ten years have flown
Days come and then they go
Is this your life you're meant to know
Is it too late for you to glow
Everything depends
On one single chance
Should you accept this dance

The long long day is through
Figure out what is true
Close your eyes and think about
What you can live without
Close your eyes and think about
What you can live without
Close your eyes and think about
What you can live without
Close your eyes and think about
What you can live without
Close your eyes and think about
What you can live without

Put the pillow under your head.
I'm sick and tired of all of your worries.

Shut up and say goodnight.
Say your prayers and turn out the lights.
I'm sick and tired of all of your sob stories.

Shut up and shut your eyes.
No more histrionics, no more college tries.
Stop pushing. Stop shoving. Stop straining.

Shut your mouth and button your lip.
You're a late night faucet that's got a drip.
All your doing is mearly complaining.

The excuse that you're crazy is useless.
You're not biting, you're barking.
You're toothless.
But you're ruthless.

Shut up and count some sheep.
Do me a favor and don't bitch in your sleep.
No more agony.
Please, no more sorrow.

Shut up and catch some ZZZs.
Ice cream with a cherry plus a big pretty please.
I promise we'll resume tomorrow.
Good night."

For visions I'd never see

Laid out on the floor

That you're gonna make it through another night

You've the breath of my mother, the life of a stranger;
and there's so much to tell - so much I need to know.
All of the stories, and reasons
But your face I remember and your breath I remember
Take me in your arms, take me in your arms
So go out tonight and look up at the stars,
the light that you see is as old as I am.
And that's what I see, when I gaze in your eyes
Loving a ghost lost in confusion of time - but our love remains
through these brightest hours.
And my secret world
And your face I remember - and your breath I remember
Take me in your arms, take me in your arms"

And, oh, what a wreck you've made me

Are you there, over the ocean?
Are you there, up in the sky?
Until the return of my love, this lullaby

My hope is on the horizon
Every face, your eyes I can see
I plead and pray though each night and day
Our embrace is only a dream

And as sure as days come from moments
Each hour becomes a life's time
When she'd left, I'd only begun this lullaby"

And you stood tall
Now you will fall

Now you will fall

It's hard to know where to begin
So send the question in the wind
And give an answer to a friend
Place your past into a book
Put in everything you ever took
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook

Softly through the shadow of the evenin' sun
Stealin' past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searchin' out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the Spiderman is always hungry"

I know that you're shy
Just let me sing you to sleep

Just say the word, I mean anything
Rest assured, if you start to doze
Then I'll tuck you in
Plant my lips where your necklace is closed
It's those pills that you don't need to take
Medicating perfection, now that's a mistake
I know that you're spent
Just let me sing you to sleep
It's your finger, and how I'm wrapped around it
It's your grace, and how it keeps me grounded
I know that you're weak
Just let me sing you to sleep
If you need anything
Just say the word, I mean anything
Rest assured, if you start to doze
Then I'll tuck you in
Plant my lips where your necklace is closed
While you were sleeping, I figured out everything
I was constructed for you and you were molded for me
Now I feel your name, coursin' through my veins
You shine so bright, it's insane, you put the sun to shame
If you need anything
Just say the word, I mean anything
Rest assured, if you start to doze

No heaven above us
Just mile after mile of empty sky

No right or wrong

A world where there's no more need to cry
But no joy or passion
Its seems that the price is much to high
But I am holding out for something real

And though you offered peace
What I really need comes to so much more
Your dreams are not enough
What I need is love that's worth dying for

You say that you're a dreamer
Well I'm a dreamer too
But I wont sing your lullaby
However well intentioned
Its neither good nor true
The pallid dream is just a lie

All the people, heading for home
They don't believe that what they saw was magic

Oh, it was magic I know
This night was full of it
I never saw the undertow, no
Never saw the evil, never saw the evil
I never saw the evil down below

I will never forget that night
I saw the magic in your eyes
We will never forget that night
We saw the magic in each other's eyes

In the darkness, after the show
Outside the theater
The air is damp and cold
All the people, they are gone
Just you and me, and we believe in magic

Oh, it was magic I know
Talking the night away
The things we like are all the same
Wanna get to know her
Wanna get to know her
I gotta get to know her deep down inside

Suddenly I feel so cold
It feels as if a ghost is next to me
Cold breath in my ear, as it whispers
Kiss her now

Oh, it was magic I know
That kiss one year ago
A magic seal of our eternal love
Tonight she went to the theater alone
She never came home and I gotta find her now

I will never forget that night
I saw the magic in your eyes
We will never forget that night
We saw the magic in each other's eyes

I will never forget that night
I saw the magic in your eyes
We will never forget that night
We saw the magic in each other's eyes"
magic,nick drake,Already processed,"I was born to love no one
No one to love me
Only the wind in the long green grass
The frost in a broken tree.

I was made to love magic
All its wonder to know
But you all lost that magic
Many many years ago.

I was born to use my eyes
Dream with the sun and the skies
To float away in a lifelong song
In the mist where melody flies.

I was made to love magic...

I was born to sail away
Into a land of forever
Not to be tied to an old stone grave
In your land of never.

I was made to love magic..."

Under what holy spell?
Nature's mother knew it
Only too well

She reached out her fingers
To point at the sky
Leaving me helpless
Not knowing why

And this is the hour
That they turn out the light
Nothing but memories
Burning so bright
Burning so bright

Oh, what made us do it?
Under what holy spell?
Nature's mother knew it
Only too well

Without your touch, don't know what i become
With all my heart, I still believe in magic

No more shadows, you gave me light
Woke me up, brought me back to life
Won't be lonely again

In a trance, I'm oblivious

Right here, right now, always

how could we say goodbye...
In the heat of the day...
it could have been the end...

And didn't you love New York
And the sight of natural green
A sad adventure this has been
But now my mind is new and clean
We'll meet again in another dream
Make a wish for all you've seen
Oh make a wish
Don't hand me down some clever book
There may be time for just one look
We'll have to say it all
With just one look we'll have to say it

And all things sweet
We sing a yum-a-yum chum
To the moon and the sun
And the rumble of the drums

And we shine our gold teeth

A flame on a match

Barking up the wrong tree
A creature conditioned
To employ matrimony

Crumbling continuity

The ceremony makes me zealous

Fear from being neutered

Quickly I'm altered and tempted
By new love only rented

Alternative plans
So I did without the lot
Put emotion on hold
And hoped my instincts
Would do what they were told

But every now and then
Often at night
A particular feeling would surface in spite
Of what I'd told myself

Was getting strange

Caught my eye

I might be their kind of guy

Of an adolescent urge
Was in retreat
And I was on the verge
Of falling in love
Or having fun
Time was running out
Something had to be done

I wanna know, yeah

Laying down the law
Dancing with the others
Out on the floor
Music and smoke
What did it mean?
Somebody spoke
And I went into a dream
I had what I wanted
Madly in love
Nothing else mattered
This was enough
Questions were answered
Which used to perplex
In particular those about
The big s.e.x.

The most important thing
Is not to end up bitter
'Cause when you start to feel
Increasingly forlorner
- Woomph! - love comes
Right around the corner
It may not last

He hides behind the rocks and waits for you
He deftly never steps ashore.
While he wastes his time, his dreams are full.
He's ready now to steal it all from me.
My greatest joy would be to destroy you,
Your greatest joy would be to destroy me.

Go ahead, and come so far
God is watching, you know you're a star.

He painted his room, since he lived like a dog.
I want to watch you suffer violently.
When you're with me you forget your alone.
Found a birthplace for a blooded corpse.
You've got to slow it-slow it-slow it down some,
The blood is crimson on my shoulder,
Shines like the blood of the older.

Muscles of his muse were stronger.
Branches of a metal shelter,
Calculating your course mentor. (?)
The inflection of a local dialect,
Leaves us stuck with no regrets.

Go ahead, and come so far

Why happiness belonged to the other kids, not me in any way

Couldn't learn to read the signs
I kept hiding within myself
Like a bird afraid to fly
With no fire within myself
I couldn't burn to reach the skies
The child within myself was a mess and yes,
I needed a miracle to open the gates
For the light to kick out loneliness

What I need is a miracle

The keeper of the door faced me eye to eye
I couldn't let the mirror fall for the fear I would break inside

The only constant is me, and me I can't trust.

Did you ever see a man
Who did walk down the street
White robe with no shoes on his feet
And on top of his head place a box with two slits
And the sign from his neck said
""I do not exist""
Or a woman who could not remember her name
Did stutter and stutter
Again and again
And saw you and called you her son
Her eyes said
""My being is gone

Have you listened to an image
Have you ever touched a thought
Have you ever tasted nothing
Have you ever told a lie

Because truth it had lied
All its life when it spoke to you?
And what did it say
It is that it is this
This goes here here is there
It is not yes it is
It was dulling your senses
Your eyes they were bound
Have you ever my friends
Been looking around?

And the other replies
With a wave of a hand
I am already here
In this promised land
But not by a god and not by a king
And not by a spirit
Deep from within
I am here
Because a miracle's a whim
It's a flash of glory
It's an empty tin
And maybe might lets you in
Not to save you
But to keep on looking-

Miserere

Been so happy that you're sad?
That the lights turn to stars
And the stars become eyes
And hello's are goodbye's
And the laughs are the sigh's

Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad
Even when you smile
Even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes
Deep inside, you wanna cry
Cuz you're scared
I ain't there?

No more crying
Wipe them tears
Daddy's here
No more nightmares
We gonna pull together through it
We gon' do it

We're all we got in this world
When it spins
When it swirls
When it whirls
When it twirls

Looking puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move
Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it
But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that
The more it backfires on me
All the things, growing up
As daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see
But you see just as much as he did
That we did not plan it to be this way
You're mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being
Together ever again
Like we used to be when was teenagers
But then of course
Everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something
We have no control over
And that's what destiny is
But no more worries
Rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up
And this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Mama's gonna be alright
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christamas presents up
And stuck them under the tree
And said some of them were from me
Cos daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night cryin'
Cuz daddy felt like a bum
See daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom, was saving money
For you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you
So you can go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars
Till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
Mom and dads was arguing a lot
So mama moved back on the Chalmers (?) in the flat
One bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novarra
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me
But daddy had to work
You and mama had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it
And you and Laney were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone
Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin'
Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown
It's almost like your sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are
And daddy's still here
Laney I'm talking to you too
Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I told ya daddy's here to hold ya
Through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise
Mama's gonna be alright
And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mocking bird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you
I'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if the mockingbird don't sing and the ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdy's neck
I'll go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat
Don't fuck wit dat

Breakdown these walls that we've built around ourselves
All we need is a little bit of inertia
Breakdown and tell, breakdown and tell

Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there

Are you warm? Are you real, Mona Lisa?

money,that poppy,Already processed,"When I was a little girl
I used to think I was wrong
For wanting diamonds and pearls

I never had anything
No Chanel or Tiffany
Like all the popular girls

They say the best things are free
But I don't get what they mean
'Cause I want everything

And money doesn't grow on trees
You can't just plant a seed
You gotta work it out

Gimme some of that cold cash
I want to stuff it in my couch
Come and bring me those big stacks
I need the bricks to build my house

Give me all of that, all of that 'til the ATM runs out
If money can't buy happiness then why is it so fabulous?

When I was only 15
I packed my bags and I said
Goodbye to mom and dad

I was afraid and alone
Living without a home
Got rid of all I had

They say the best things are free
But I can't get what I need
Without some currency

And money doesn't grow on trees
You can't just plant a seed
You gotta work it out

Gimme some of that cold cash
I want to stuff it in my couch
Come and bring me those big stacks
I need the bricks to build my house

Give me all of that, all of that 'til the ATM runs out

It caught on in a flash

From the hall of gore in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

The party had just begun
The guests included Wolf-Man,
Dracula and his son.

The brain surgeons were all digging the sounds
Of Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The poodle stabbers were about to arrive
With their vocal group The Crypt-Kicker Five

Holding hands with other monsters
And attempting to be human beings
Shuffling around the shops

Sitting on park benches
Eating little packets of sultanas
Licking chocolate off their chubby little fingers

And I don't know why
It is they scare me
But they do
And the thing that really frightens me
Is that all my friends from school

Are turning into monsters
Picking patterns out for curtains
Making friends with all the other monsters
Pushing little baby monsters
Around the shops in prams

This town is full of monsters
Peeping out from under parked cars
In multi-storey car park
Evil little eyes like fairy lights
Blinking in the dark

This town is full of monsters
Making out with other monsters
Picking sweet corn out of their teeth
Dipping pissy little fingers
In the pick 'n' mix

And I don't even know why
It is it scares me
But it does
And the thing that really frightens me

Telling me how great their life is
And how happy I would be if I could

I drink you in and breathe you out

I'm camouflaged when the sun shines

Two ships passing in the night
Two lips pressing ground the tides

I believe the world it spins for you
We will never be, I am the moon

I believe the world it spins for you

We will never be, I am the moon

I long to be a part

I isolate my heart
You've drawn me into your world
Now I too spin limbless

One hand clapping, where's the wind
I stand spanning at your distant wings

I believe the world it spins for you

After a long and sleepless night
How many stars would you give to the moon
Do you see those stars from where you are?
Shine on the lost and loneliest
The ones who can't get over it
You always wanted more than life
But now you don't have the appetite
In a message to the troubador
The world don't love you anymore
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun?
Stuck inside the rainbow years
And you could happen to me
'Cause I've been close to where you are
I drove to places you have seen
It all seems so familiar
Like they'd been sent to kill ya
It doesn't take an astronaut
To float in the space is just a thought
The morning brings a mystery
The evening makes it history
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun?
And the village drunk
Sadly passed away
It was a shame
I never knew his name
I wonder if he sat there every morning
And watched the sun rise
How do you rate the morning sun?
It was just too heavy for me
And all I wanted was the world
If you are the starlet in the sun
Don't go wasting your time
'Cause there is no finish line
And you don't see anything
Not even love, not anything
The night can take the man from you
A sense of wonder overdue
The morning brings a mystery
The evening makes it history
Who am I to rate the morning sun?"

My nigga's wife said niggas just ran up on cousin
What niggas? She said it was some rappers from Ohio
That been out here north of Atlanta bone thugging
Ran up on him and did what then?
She said they stomped him at the club then pandemonium erupted

Going through my mind, is she telling me shots was fired
Them Ohio niggas is rock supplying
Heated, stop answering, start spending them niggas calls
Every time he went to see him he went in them rented cars
So it was even harder to find him so they figured
They'd go to the D tomorrow and surprise him
Did they kill him? ""Nah, they only shot a couple times
Heard they was hitting walls."" The nerve of these niggas' balls
Who was he with? ""He was with Tre""
He in the hospital too? ""Nah."" Needless to say, call you back
I called up Tre, Tre answered, I said
Hey man, keep it real fam, why the fuck you still standing?
He said, ""Nickel I'm a killer, not a fighter
So I got up out the way because my weight's a lot lighter
Them niggas was big so I slid but I promise on my kids

I hit the exit without blinking to thinking in the process
Tre come running out with a fully on some hot shit
I'm like weapons ain't a thing, killing is the object
What was you doing when they was kicking all on my fam?

Why you got to be so obnoxious?""
What? Just tell me where them niggas at before I take your ass hostage

This ain't the time
""But what if this our only opportunity to find them""
I said you right, pulled into the alley and seen two people in front of them niggas' car taking out garbage
I said wait till these people finish, they innocent
Soon as they go back in their cribs we going to finish it
No sooner than a second after
Tre jumps out of the passenger side blasting
Past them niggas we here to kill, hitting them innocent bystanders
Tearing their trash up
Our enemies jumped out of their car waving badges
They all shooting at me, nobody blazing at him
This ain't adding up
Car in reverse, now I'm mashing, leaving Tre behind
Even though it's some questions that I got to ask him

Murder

Burning rubber away from there in a bullet riddled car
Trying to piece this shit together, hitting the boulevard
If them niggas is the police, what the fuck is Tre?
He ain't dead or in jail by now then he the other way
Snitch or pig, I got to talk to my cousin
That nigga setting me up then I'm a lift his lid
That nigga know how hostile my reactions
I call and try to find out what hospital he at then
Every nigga pickup just laugh when I ask
Have you heard about cuz getting smashed maybe I'm the ass then
Head hurting like a motherfucker, looking for a gas station
Now a nigga need a fucking aspirin
I hear a familiar ringtone from my phone
It's my bitch texting me telling me don't come home
I'm thinking damn should I text back, why me
My phone starts ringing it's Tre on the ID
He said, ""Them niggas tried to get me but I slid""
He want to tell me in person, meet me at my crib
I said nigga please
I threw the phone out the window rolled over it crushed it into a million pieces
I hit the blinker quick then hit the highway
If I'm a be a target y'all know I'm a do it my way
After I rolled for a few hours I'd say
I was tired after I got out of the tri state
Can't help but feel like another lame exposed
Pulling up to an old telly in the rain and cold"

Dancing 'round like that will drive me crazy.
But why would i want you,
When it's plain you're not ever wanting me?

Well my whole life all i had was this guitar.
Never gonna be lonely when all i have is music in my heart.
Never gonna wanna be something i am not.
As i get older i'm a be happy with what i got.

(Chorus)
'Cause i got music,
And it makes me feel alright.
Got this here music,
And it helps me ease my mind up.
'Cause i got music,
And it takes away the pain.
Got this here music,
And i got it every, every, every day.

Hey my friend's like that,
He drives all those little girls crazy.
Say did you see us,
In the background of the crowd on the TV?
On a summer's day we go and catch some morning waves.
Hanging out with my friends and the vibe can only be ok.
Just like I don't remember rainy days when i was small,
You know i won't remember hatred or nothing at all.

(Chorus)

No tempremental alibis,
And I'm not wasting all my time.
And I am looking for the truth in this.
And i don't know just what I'll get, just what ill get.
Coz i got this in music

You're calling off the guards (Am I coming?)
I'm coming through (Am I coming?)
Adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission
You know, sometimes it just feels better to give in

And it's all too familiar
Only it happens all the time
All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime
But it's you I can't deny
(You I can't deny)

Dull heat rises from the sheets
I'm both a patient boy
Well, and a jealous man (Am I coming?)
But double standardized suspicion
Is remedied, oh, my blue heaven
Sometimes it just feels better to give in
(Sometimes it just feels better to give in)

And it's all too familiar
Only it happens all the time
All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime
But it's you I can't deny

We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in
My head starts to sing
""You're safe, child, you are safe""

Is this all too familiar?
Does it happen all the time?
I'm just asking you to hear me
Could you please, just once, just hear me?

She moves among the flowers

I was walking around the flower show like a leper
Coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria
When I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair
Up against the pink and purple wisteria
You said, hey, nature boy, are you looking at me
With some unrighteous intention?
My knees went weak,
I couldn't speak, I was having thoughts
That were not in my best interests to mention
And she moves among the flowers
And she floats upon the smoke
She moves among the shadows
She moves me with just one little look
You took me back to your place
And dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit
You played the patriot, you raised the flag
And I stood at full salute
Later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb
And made it impossible to speak
As you closed in, in slow motion,
Quoting Sappho, in the original Greek
She moves among the shadows
She floats upon the breeze
She moves among the candles
And we moved through the days
and through the years
Years passed by, we were walking by the sea
Half delirious
You smiled at me and said, Babe
I think this thing is getting kind of serious
You pointed at something and said
Have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?
It was then that I broke down
It was then that you lifted me up again
She moves among the sparrows
And she walks across the sea
She moves among the flowers
And she moves something deep inside of me
She moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
She moves among the flowers
And she moves right up close to me"

Threw all my old things away

I got your letter
Thanks for the offer
Really don't need a thing
Open the door in front of me

The sun is now shining down on me
Meet me as soon as you can
Bring me the money you're holding for me
Taking my head out of the sand

Oh, maybe I'll go see the world?
There's plenty of places to see
Voices I never have heard
Look at the way it ought to be

Oh, I'm on a roll
Oh, I'm on a roll
And are you still listening to me?
There isn't a light as far as I see"

That's the sound somebody makes when they're getting away
Leaving next week's hanging jury far behind them
Prisoner only of the choices they have made

Night Train...
Night Train...

Ice cube in a dark drink shines like starlight
The moon is floating somewhere out at sea
On an island in the blur of noise and color
Alcatraz, St. Alina, Patmos and the Chateau D'if

Night Train...
Night Train...

And everyone's an island edged with sand
A temporary refuge where somebody else can stand
Till the sea that binds us like the forced tie of a blood oath
Will wear it down, dissolve it, recombine it

Anyone can die here they do it every day
It doesn't take much effort though it goes against the grain
And the ultimate forgetfulness of violence
Sweeps the landscape like a headlight of a train

Night Train...

Ice cube in a dark drink shines like starlight
Starlight shines like glass shards in dark hair
And the mind's eye tumbles out along the steel track
Fixing every shadow with its stare

Night Train...
Night Train...

And in the absence of a vision there are nightmares
And in the absence of compassion there is cancer
Whose banner waves over palaces and mean streets
And the rhythm of the night train is a mantra"

Fuck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret
Talking to me is like a fucking body missing her neck
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off
Life is a bitch and my cock's soft, the Glock's cocked
My hands trembled, my finger's slipped, the wall's red
Her life is fucked, she sad now, her son is dead

I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems

When I was younger, I would smile a lot
I'm getting older, getting bolder but a wiser top
Now I'm drunk driving, lap's full of the Budweiser tops
Life is a movie and you're just a prop
They begged me to stop but I listen like death drones
Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some

But I never had a drink, ""Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!""
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough
I won't feel the feeling I be feeling when I'm sobered up
But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that I'm
As emotionally strained as Travis when he's. (Tyler, calm down)
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5"" about to fucking cry

I finally had a family
Domo's in another state, where the fuck is Riley?
Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death
One ear I got kids screaming ""O.F. is the best""
The other ear I got Tron Cat asking where the bullets and the bombs at
So I can kill these levels of stress, shit
They say that I'm shock value
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
I haven't got around to telling my mom shit
Cause I don't know how to. (Whoa)
All I want is her support, whenever the fight's at home
When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown
Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown
And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis pad with a backpack
For the whole week full of plastic-wrapped black tees
And deodorant like this house is my home
I could live with the same hat
And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday
Where I skate with the same fucking friends at
Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
""Message from GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat""
Email full of emails, I never write back
Ain't kill myself yet, now I already want my life back

I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air

I'm blowin' them flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
You're on the side of faggots and cock blockers
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human

You niggas can't harm me cause you all know that

North Carolina on the way to somewhere.
And it began to snow.

And the bus stopped at a little cafe
In the hills and the passengers entered.
And he sat at the counter with the
Others, and he ordered, the food arrived.
And the meal was particularly good, and the coffee.

The waitress was unlike the women he had known.
She was unaffected, and there was a natural humor which came from her.
And the fry cook said crazy things and the
Dishwasher in back laughed a good clean pleasant laugh.

And the young man watched the snow through the window.
And he wanted to stay in that cafe forever.
The curious feeling swam through him that everything was
Beautiful there and it would always stay beautiful there.

And then the bus driver told the passengers that it was time to board.
And the young man thought ""I'll just stay here, I'll just stay here""
And then he rose and he followed the others into the bus.
He found his seat and looked at the cafe through the window and
Then the bus moved off, down a curve, downward, out of the hills.

And the young man looked straight forward.
And he heard the other passengers speaking of other things,
Or they were reading or trying to sleep.
And they hadn't noticed the magic.
And the young man put his head to one
Side, closed his eyes, and pretended to sleep.

There was nothing else to do,
Just to listen to the sound of the
Engine, and the sound of the tires, in the snow."

will I sink or swim up to the gods to pull me in?
Like a fish in the sea
come to me
bad retention is
killing our sheep

light through sleeping eyes
blend the colors with the night
song constructed from the fire
sing it all the way to the sky

ten thousand years and you're still not ready for changes
you've got your fathers eyes
but who will have them after you die?"

I tried to leave you many times I almost succeeded once
Dreams are coming one by one to ask me what I've done

She did so well without me but I wonder if she's free

Get out from my heart
夕立そっと空に虹をかければ季節もう変わってる
行き交う人の波に君に似てる背中をまた探してる

I'm out here in the street
Everything is quiet

You left me without warning

It's still the same old city
But you are here no more

Not alone
You're not alone
If you're still out here on your own
You're not alone

Here comes New Year's dawning
I'm out here on my feet
There is a cold wind blowing
But no place we could meet

It hit me without warning
My life won't be the same
I see the same old faces
Except you to call my name

Not alone
You're not alone
If you're still out here on your own
You're not alone
You're not alone
Yeah, I wish you would have known
You're not alone

This world is like a vampire
That slowly sucks you dry
We should have been together
We should have been so high
This world is just a bird cage
That doesn't let us fly
We should have been together
We should have been
Should have been
Not alone

You're not alone

The only thing a-touching him is a crack of light
Pieces of her hair are wrapped around and 'round his fingers
And he reaches for her side, for any sign of her that lingers

And she says you are not alone, laying in the light
Put out the fire in your head and lay with me tonight

One of them bullets went straight for the jugular vein
There were people running, a flash of light, then everything changed
Nothing really matters in the end, you know all the worries sever
Don't be afraid for me my friend, one day we all fall down forever

CHORUS

The wedding date was June, just like any other bride
She loved him like no one before and it was good to be alive
But sometimes that can slip away as fast as any fingers through your hands
So you let time forgive the past and go and make some other plans

Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you been gone, I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose

I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you

I went to the doctor, guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said, ""Girl you better try to have fun, no matter what you do""
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted mama
In the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you"

He's waiting down at the corner under the streetlight
He's only following orders 'til midnight
And then he'll sneak back home to his wife,
And his everyday life.
He says he's been at the pub with the boys all night,
She acts as if she don't know says its alright.
But he knows she don't believe him.

On and on, on and on.

(Chorus)
Cause nothing lasts forever,
And nothing lasts forever.
Everything dies eventually,
Cover your eyes if you don't want to see.

(Verse)
This isn't how she thort that her life should be.
When they first met back in '63,
And a future together was all she could see.
He said if you stick with me,
Then you know we'll be alright.
A family for the rest of our lives,
And ill always be by your side.
And that's when she cried.

On and on, on and on.

(Chorus)
Cause nothing lasts forever,
And nothing lasts forever.
Everything dies eventually,
Cover your eyes if you don't want to see.

(Verse)
So he takes off his tie and he tells another lie,
She only believed it for a minute.
And she dosen't ask why,
She doesn't want to pry.
She only believes it for a minute.
He's walking out the door and into a new life,
He's already got plans with his new wife,
And a house in a new neighborhood.
He says he's been at the pub with the boys all night,
She acts as if she don't know,
Says its alright.
But he knows she don't believe him,
But she's sick of arguing.

On and on, on and on.

(Chorus)
Cause nothing lasts forever
And nothing lasts forever
Everything dies eventually
Cover your eyes if you don't want to see

She's been waking around,
With her heart dragging on the ground.
She don't need to frown."

There was a light that shined on us

Only they can't see where this is gonna end
They all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense

I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words

I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing (nothing, nothing, nothing)

So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences

The sky looked sweet
When we dropped
A big bomb at our feet
And sometime soon
We all might zoom
To space and continue
With another zoo

Work and pace
For paper face
Spend it wisely
And keep it safe
Because the human race
Is a non-stop race
With too many trials
But no real case

Something about this second
Something about this hour
Take away the money
Then the time becomes the power
A moment just to swim
And to shower and to sing
And to brighten and to dim
And to sleep and to wander in

Nothing
Oh sweet nothing
Today we're doing nothing at all

Yesterday
I climbed a hill
Then cycle down speedy
On a great big wheel
Feeling ill
Laboured still
Grinding and stressing
In that giant mill

Drove a car
Stop and start
Round and round in circles
Never got too far
Running barefoot
On the hot hot tar
? Cause if you stop
Then you burn
Then your feet get scars

Something about this instance
Something about this minute
Striving for the future
But don't realise that we're in it
A moment just to float
To ponder and to dote
To dry and to soak
And to take a little toke of that

Nothing
Oh sweet nothing
Today we're doing nothing at all"

On my way home, each day
And no, I won't admit it
Not even to my friends
They think I'm doing well
And I even lie to myself

How long can you keep a secret from yourself?
Like that storm that blew me back two years
To that first step I took away from you
And the hope that you left
It's hidden in my room
I'm a strong woman
But sometimes I'm weak for you

On and on, I close my eyes and I'm still there, I'm still there

But I never made it to the phone

And if it falls then I might blow away

I'm numb inside

A storm of times and overlapping things
This information has left me overwhelmed

One that stops him feeling at all
He's in love with a drug
Forget everyone
He really doesn't care anymore

Come on a trip to the centre of the nebulous place
I'm your host (Space Ghost!) on this cosmos chase
It's a pattern around Saturn, so watch the rings
Then follow the flight plan to Andromeda's wings
Point your kaleidoscope at the balance expanse
Never any bending the surface of molecular plans
Enhance, the beat can secret so can search's and saves
and signals, but not radio waves
Cause' you've tuned into the top ten, the pop is repetitive
A sedative that would make insomniacs relax
Into a mummified state, but I'll unravel the clock
Travel the harp, and feed a bon-bon to a ton-ton
In other words, I duck and make the cargo drop
In simple terms, I stop and rock the spot
So I'm working on a new anti-gravity design
In the jet-propulsion lab with Young Einstein,(and)
Let me play Willy Mays and say hey to Dizzy Dustin
Formerly known as cue-ball, back when I was called too tall
But now with you-Haul, packing up, making moves to new places
(Including the Oasis!)
It's not a mirage, but a barrage of spoken ballet
Everyone is spun by the tongue, conductors DJ
It takes your ora from the world of the morbid
Shoot you through a vacuum, put you into orbit

Head to handicap, contact someone
To the percussion club drubbing up the non-hum drum
As it runs it and thus becomes a product of the ugly
Now we can make it lovely (Like)
A life can become a slow death, but one is left
It's sold to a genie with bandini on it's breath
Never came to baggage claim, so no venture over the fences into the frontier
Where regret is varied consequences
On the laster days, there will be no castaways
Coming aboard cause' there'll be more into the black hole
But we can clear this stratosphere
And watch planets disappear from the inside of our capsule
Andy Cat to Earth(This is mission control)
Prognosis?(All systems go)
Good, I'm going to make the jump to light speed to see my mom and d-a-d
Hey the apple didn't fall to far from the tree
Though it's not the route I claim, but the food I became
That should be judged because their not always the same
And if your aim is to criticize me
(then you)Then you can call the 1800 hotline(but it's not mine)
I don't make money like the hubbly and bubbly house
Still I'm thirsting to stay at the O.K Crowd
But my stomach won't growl and I'll bathe in the graces
Of timeless joy, via the oasis

And light our fires in Egypt Bottom

When we meet we can talk awhile
I can sleep in your dreams
The night alone I've been waiting

The saddled streets, the burro beats down my door
When you say it's no love affair
I will know and when we go
I'll be the only thing who cares

I've been waiting awhile

Here I come, Omaha
Hiding out
I got hot head, hot eyes, hot ticks, hot mouth
Each howl, I get bigger
I can't stay, I can for the night, for the night
For the weekend and the night
I've been aiding my fall
Aiding my fall, aiding my fall

We would tell all of those other fucking cunts to go to hell

They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that

I'd be so afraid (so afraid)
'Cause the love that we share would be hard to replace
Baby, hold me and never leave me
This love is my oxygen

Open your heart
Take a deep breath
Stop searching, start believing
Make sure you're there to answer when love comes around
Don't be surprised
When true love knocks at your door

You're the breath that I take
You're the smile on my face
Every time I breathe in
Brings me warmth from within
When you touch me I start believing
Loving is like oxygen

C'mon down we're having a parade!""

Everybody in this town
Is turning brown, it's summertime
C'mon down we're having a parade
Don't answer your phone, let it sing
And join the orchestra of rings
That will be our soundtrack for today

A million people realize there's better things to do
Than wasting their whole lives being accessible to you
Like throwing off their clothes and marching down the avenue
Singing ""i'm in new york city, don't i look so pretty? hey!""

Mike bloomberg and jesse jackson
Sit in tompkins square relaxin'
Reach a stalemate start another game
Sarah jessica, tawana,
And the indian jane fonda
Eating mr. softies in the shade

A big fat mama in a thong
And a college girl with nothing on
Share a laugh over a lemonade
Seven foot trannies trading tricks
With business men on pogo sticks
'Cause everyone's invited, hip hooray!

A million people realizing that reality
Is much more real outside their door than it is on TV
A plethora of specimens have taken to the street
Singing ""i'm in new york city, don't i look so pretty? hey!""

It's summertime in new york city
And the people aren't just plain old pretty
They're hot as hell, i think i'm gonna faint
Even the junkies and the hari krishnas
And the guy who spray paints solar systems
On the backs of plastic paper plates

It's so hot you could fry an egg
On the back of the pit-bull humping my leg
I kinda like it, what more can i say?
'Cept here comes hot dog in her wig
She's three times a lady, sweating like a pig
The sun is shining everything's okay

A million people realize a smile on someone's face
Is even more contagious than west nile or sars or aids
And what makes people smile more than a big parade
Through the streets of new york city
Where everyone's so pretty
Life used to be so shitty
But it's summertime, summertime, summertime, wooooooooo!

Is it me that they see or is it my act
Is it G's that I need to go and stack
Is it pleasing and smiling to react
To the teasing they do with a new contract
All I see is fake smiling men in black
Acting like they my friends like dudes in an act
Matter of fact; I'm about to crack
Break glass, quick fast
This lack of cash got me making these rash decisions
Looking passed my mission
Paranoid thought blurring my vision
As I'm sitting in front of the television I won't fail to bite a nail
As I'm waiting to exhale
Like when my landlord tries to call me
I throw away the phone and reject the call
See, probably one time too many
That I had to pay my rent but I didn't have any
Pesos or cashflow I lace flows on the daily, but it don't pay a penny
Paranoid thought be consuming me
Leaving no room to see myself as anything other than a doomed mc
So maybe i'm a doomed mv
Or maybe...
Snakes in the grass, they on my ass
Don't know who they are cause they're moving fast
So many cats that be on my dick
It makes me sick
Thik they can take my cash quick
Paranoid as fuck
They be looking at Pete Phily like they starstruck
Don't they know me, wanna know me
Wanna throw me a pound like they my homie
Nah, they aint getting nada
Talkin don dada yadayada, wearing they pradas
Nah, I'll keep my distance
It's the business
It's this crazy existence how weird it feels; the chills through my spine
I just need to unwind
Yo, some say I'm manic depressice (panic)
All I can say is they been stalking me ever since I was an adolescent
Now between you and me
All that I can see is all these eyes folowing me
Now they're coming for me
Now they're gunning for me

And solitude is never easy to maintain,

While a little dog barks its head off,
In the distance.

Oh, what a perfect day,
To think about my silly world.
My feet are firmly screwed to the floor.
What is there to fear from such a regular world?
Passing by a cemetery,
I think of all the little hopes and dreams,
That lie lifeless and unfilled beneath the soil.
I see an old man fingering his perishing flesh.
He tells himself he was a good man and did good things.
Amused and confused by life's little ironies,
He swallows his bottle of distilled damnation.
People turn around with unseeing eyes.
They're looking for something that doesn't exist.
The world you once knew is being eaten up by rust.
No-one has time for the past, but still, in God they trust.
The future is now, but it's all going wrong.
Bodies good for nothing, but it's to nothing they belong.
People say prayers and some work hard.
If you give them all your money, they'll give you their hearts.
This town ain't going like a ghost town.
It's going like hell....

Rifle through, find a very nice one
If there's a crease in my face over time
There's plenty more where that came from

Wasted, I am better shut up
And a frame is quite confining
Hang me up, hang me up

When I'm alone and the world is a fist
Well, I am weightless

Free from all the picture perfect

Faced around with honest answers
Choking on a silent device

The deep orange brickwork let it be

When I'm excited and have to wait,
My organs start to move, my lungs pump,
Cells flow faster on tracks inside me,
I demand to see myself from within,
Be a cell for a day.

Gliding down imaginary rollercoaster-paths along the sky
I can do somersaults around Jupiter if I feel like it
Nothing can stop a planet

Tin foil and melted sugar everywhere,

And now he talks about dragons on the walls,
He used to like german expression films,
Now he drinks until he falls,
I was confused, didn't know what to do,
So i called his momma
Had to come on over,
She got him off the ground,
Started slapping him around

My views of this world are ever growing
Thus ever growing is the way one must view me
A soul of conviction unjustly convicted
Happy tv commercials and bi-racial shows
The smell of reality still burns my nose
Not content until it smells like a rose
Whether it's in syle to keep the fight
I tread these waters and make my waves yes I do
And I will fight until my dying day
And even after that my ghost resides with pride
Forward ever backward never
Day by day these trials I trod
Always triumphant never fail
We've come too far to turn back now
I won't turn back I move
My blood is thicker than the waters of any flood
Here I am facing the almighty herself
If she approves then I am saved
Clear of trouble is the path I pave
For generations to walk and run
Whether it's in style to keep the fight
I tread these waters and make waves GOD knows
And I will fight until my dying day
And even after that my ghost resides with pride"

You lied, you lied, you lied, you lied

Dancing around with all the ghosts in empty homes
You sang and you sounded like you knew it was your own
Rang out a shot in the dark, some things are best to let fall apart
And you knew, oh, how you knew

In the red July
When we bit the dust on Providence
Oh, tangle me up, tangle me up
And on the last hurrah
We'd better make it hurt
'Cause our time is spent
We lied, we lied, we lied, we lied

Dancing around with all the ghosts in empty homes
You sang and you sounded like you knew it was your own
Rang out a shot in the dark, some things are best to let fall apart

Now in the bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed, have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before during or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids, in a more derogatory way

And what not to say
Let's ask Dr. Dre (What up?)
Dr. Dre, I got a question if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt butt when he tees off (Yeah)
But uh, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hut-hut
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay
I just need to clear things up

When the Springsteen came clear in my headphones with a pertinent question
Oh is love really real and do any of hope for redemption?
Or are we are merely biting our time down to the lonely conclusions?
Darling let me take your hand as I talk you through this
How loneliness edged into deep seated psychosis
Lying awake in crowded hotel rooms focused on tape hiss,
With my failings laid clear on the ceiling
I don't think I can do this
I don't think I can do this
Well I tried so hard to not turn into my father
But if I only ever skip out his choices will I ever choose better?
Oh the sad truth is the grass it will always seem greener
So I left you alone in a restaurant in London in winter
You deserved better
Adam Trask is on my back and in my ears
Sound comes clear and brings the awful truth that I can't stand what I've done to you
And it's written clear in my diary today should have been our anniversary
But I'm far way and I'm far apart
And you're back home with a broken heart
And loves is real and I can escape
I only ever have myself to blame
These failures shift and save me in the night
Like a fever I can't break, try as I might
Wake me darling I need you to take me home
But I know in the end redemption is mine and mine alone
So if each of us is made of a tally of mistakes and successes
Then that hour in the restaurant makes my score less than impressive
But each can be redeemed with the courage by which he confesses
So darling I miss you, your music and your musk and your kisses

Things you rather wanted to see in me
Should I forget myself to get over you?
All I can do is pretend and lie
To myself
Over and over again

Ghost of you
Still breathing
It won't leave me alone
It keeps on teasing
Reflections of eternity
Are dark as hell, now I can see
Despite of that I'm glad my heart and soul are still mine

I couldn't stop believing in fantasies
You destroyed then forgot, now I rebuilt
This promised land
Made by sand
Of an hourglass we've misplaced
It's broken, it has disappeared and so have you

Ghost of you
Still breathing
It won't leave me alone
It keeps on teasing
Reflections of eternity
Are dark as hell, now I can see
Despite of that I'm glad my heart and soul are still mine

reflection,tool,Already processed,"I have come curiously close to the end, now
Beneath my self-indulgent, pitiful hole

Defeated, I concede and
Move closer
I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness, how pitiful

And it's calling me...
It's calling me...
It's calling me...
It's calling me...

And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping
The moon tells me a secret, her confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me
The source is bright and endless
She rescusitates the hopeless
Without her we are lifeless satellites drifting

And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt
Don't wanna be down here serving my narcissism
I must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out

Before I pine away...
Before I pine away...
Before I pine away...
Before I pine away...

So crucify the ego, before it's far too late
And leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
And capable of all that's imagined and unconceivable
So let the light touch you, so let the words spill through
And let them pass right through
Bringing out our hope and reason

Before we pine away...
Before we pine away...
Before we pine away...
Before we pine away..."

is I've gone through my fair share of shit

I just hope you don't regret it

I wouldn't even trust you

He was after the wild ones, the mustangs, the shy ones
And hoping that I'd understand

But there's too many long nights, a wife should have some rights
It seems that it's so plain to see
Reno my husband, oh, he loves the wild ones
Much more than he'll ever love me

He's riding somewhere out there with his raven black hair
And a heart that is loving and wild
He's too much afire with ambitious desire
To be tied to a wife and a child

The horses are cunning, they soon will be running
And Reno will always be gone
These things I'm knowing, the Rio is flowing
And Reno, I'm goin' back home

'Cross the Mexican border, my house all in order
I wait for a knock on my door
Little Juan, the small one, the son of the tall one
So peacefully plays on the floor

But what are these yearnings that always keep burning?
I feel so deeply inside
My love for Reno, my flashing young gringo
Has suddenly vanquished my pride

He's riding somewhere out there with his raven black hair
And a heart that is loving and wild
He's so much afire and with too much desire
To be alone without a wife and a child

Looking for a whole lot of nothing
And then you found me at your door

Full of silent expectations noone could have known
So how would I?

restless,gordon lightfoot,Already processed,"There's a kind of a restless feeling and it pulls me from within
It sets my senses reeling and my wheels begin to spin
In the quietude of winter you can hear the wild geese cry
And I will always love that sound until the day I die

There's a plain and a simple answer to each and every quest
From every quiet dancer who might be a special guest
In a movie made for TV or a late night interview
You might even find them on the young and the restless too

Do you get that restless yearning when you hear a whistle blast
Hear an echo from the past
Of an old engine flyin' down a road that's ironcast

The lake is blue, the sky is gray and the leaves have turned to gold
The wild goose will be on her way, the weather's much too cold
When the muskie and the old trout too have all gone down to rest
We will be returning to the things that we do best

Would you get that restless feeling when you think about your dad
And the scrimshaw that he had
Of an old schooner rovin' 'neath a sky that's ironclad

There's a kind of a restless feeling and it catches you off guard
As we gaze out in a distance through the trees in my back yard
I can feel that restless yearning of those geese as off they roam
Then trade that for a warm bed and a place I can call home

Will you get that restless feeling when you hear the wicked blast
Of a spectre from the past
Of a cold diesel rollin' down a road that's built to last

Do you get that restless yearning when you hear a whistle blast
See an image from the past
Of an old schooner flyin' down a sky that's overcast"

I struggle every night with every muscle in my mic

I drink a little liquor tryin' to heal my nerves
Cuz y'all don't listen here and feel my words

And happy in my life is what I'm gonna be

She didn't need the world to make it worth the while
So I don't need no magazine to reach the pinnacle
Screw a review and you can eat the interview

I'm on the underground trying to scrape and scrounge
And sure it feel good to take a break and lounge
All these ups and downs like a roller coaster
Life is a bitch I'm trying to hold her closer
I'm killin' every nigga in sight (sight)

The bigger the dog, the bigger the fight
If you really say you know me then you'd figured I might
Try to use my anger as a trigger to write
I put it down simple on the paper or pad
And try to take a stab at what is making me mad
I jump on the track and I ride it through
And do it for the people that are tried and true
But y'all so fickle y'all love me today
And tomorrow love another cat and shove me away
But most ain't committed to do it how I did it
In the way that I did it, in the way that I spit it
It's like my burst of truth and it might hurt the booth
But first the proof, it gave birth to youth
Rap's like trying to take a piss in the wind
I'm just glad to know that some of y'all are listenin' in

Yo, you say neato, check your libido
Then show up at the church with Max Vonzeeto
Like Warren Brady in the parallax view
It's real, it's true, it's how we do

Let's chill, got take my birth control pill
It's ill, when we made it be like bovine

When I start to rhyme, can you feel my heart pound?
I just breathe and listen to the only sound
You know my thoughts are flowin freely
From my head to the page
You might think that I'm a teacher
But I am a sage

Hesta Prynn be graspin at straws
Northern State, we writin' the laws
I'm tired of all the 'what's it all' voices
For the lovin' of the game and I am livin' the dream

I flow so stupid you can't get enough of this
My [?]'s imaginary like Snuffaluffagus
I'm runnin off my mouth and Gwen Stefani says don't speak
But I got more stories than NewsWeek

Now I can see, but I used to be blind
Yo, Guinea Love I'm gonna press rewind
Said now I can see, but I used to be blind
Yo, Guinea Love I'm gonna press rewind

Yo, I hate to be the one to break it to ya
You thought you had me in the palm of your hand
But you flaked, dropped the ball, yo I can't understand
Just when is a man gonna act like a man?
See I'm married to my pen, like my name is Ayn Rand
Time slippin' through my fingers like grains of sand
Yo, throw that beat in the garbage can

Northern State don't fool around
So underground we're over ground
Ron holds it down on the pitcher's mound
I get my five-one-six on and I'm homeward bound

Beastie Boys always on vacation
Run DMC lost the motivation
ODB's on probation
Northern State is here, make sweet salvation

Chuck D talked about his uzi
Biggie smoked down up in the ja'causezi
Guinea Love is no dimwitted floozy
Got discriminated kids, I can't afford to be choosy

Ya see my rhymes will flow just like a stream of consciousness,
Like a laser beam
You fill the paper, I fill the whole ream
Yo I rocked the hot corner on my softball team, 'cause
In my dreams I fly around, 'cause I am Super Sprout (what's up)
I look good in tights and I eat ice cream
And I wipe all the bad-guys out.

Said I'm a queen, sitting on my wicker throne
In my castle on a cloud
I got a neon sign on my drawbridge that says,
""No fools allowed""

Oh oh oh
In my dreams I call the shots
'Cause I am the Invincible Prynn
I got red hair, I'm a millionaire
And I keep only good thoughts in

But I feel negative, and my life is so rough
And I'm waiting for my call back like I'm Waiting for Guffman
Smoke weed every day but I still be buggin'
My momma raised me up with lots of huggin'
Your father next round and you know I be chuggin'
When I'm up at the fable that you know I be selectin'

Said now I can see but I used to be blind
Yo DJ Sprout, I'm gonna press rewind
Said now I can see but I used to be blind
Yo DJ Sprout, I'm gonna press rewind

They call me DJ Sprout, yo
But it's just my name
I got tired of that fucked up kindergarten game
My nails are growin' long 'cause of creative juices
I got a straight flush, you got a pair of dueces

The colour of my ride is titanium frost
I always use a copy so I never get lost
I might look like a girl,
But I feel like a rapper

Hesta hooks it up when she dresses like a flapper
You can ask your friends, I'm a bit of a napper
Throw your hands in the air if you like the clapper

Northern State don't fool around
So underground we're over ground
Ron holds it down on the pitcher's mound
I get my five-one-six on and I'm homeward bound

To all the boys - no for drunk dialin'
'Cause my smile's so fuckin beguilin'
'Cause I always go that extra mile, and
Julie's in love with Scott Weiland

Yo I smoke that stinky marijuana
My favorite band used to be Nirvana
Gonna get my hoody on and go for the gold
I'm Doctor da Prynn I never do what I'm told

Yo Guinea Love keeps a pen up in her messy hair
Hesta Prynn sometimes wears underwear
Yo my rhymes have got a northern California flair

I'm writin some rhymes, sippinl some wine
I'm wonderin who's gonna be my valentine

Yo Hesta Prynn is in a sugar shock
When I do my art I like to wear a smock
I don't listen to Rebel or j.s. spock
You know I drive a l-tima just like Chris Rock

I don't do X or crystal meth
I'm not a [?] block
Well you check with death
I keep my body healthy
I keep my body tight
Just don't ask me where I was last night

Yo if it's not a drug, I want enough
So can I stay inside that summer flow
Even though it's cold and I am a loner
Gonna catch a wave and ride it home

Northern State, you know we sound tight
Our rhymes so phat, they got cellulite

Rosie helped the kids stay alive
She gave them the drugs
So they didin't die
She cleaned up their mess
As they wept and they moaned
She got paid so little
She rented her home

An angel face, with the strength of a tower
Worked every day, every minute every hour
When she wasn't on the ward
She was travelling on the train
Through the wind and the sun
And the snow and the rain

Oh rosie - we thank you again
Oh rosie - we thank you again

Works all day, no time to eat
Running back'n for to help children see
We piss up a wall all the poison we take
She barely gets out, not to dine or to drink

And bringing her back to her own little world

Fake it till I make it

You see we're born with light in our hearts
And people come around and tear us apart
And when my whole world turns to dark
I can't see anything

And when I feel it coming
I run into the shadows
I'm trying to fake it
Fake it till I make it
People try and save me

Where I could be queen of all the dark inside

But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

Cold as stone in the kitchen light

As I packed my clothes up
My dad was a man without plans to attack
And tends to show love
I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold up

And mama was the same
None of us are saints
I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces, and hope that
Things change, but for now I'll leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

And the air will be thicker,
It will be hard to breathe sometimes.
You won't know what hit you,
You'll be sad and lonely before you know it.

Now, don't go make a decision that's going to leave your life down a collision course of failure.
But you're a grown up now, you're 18.
Just don't come running back to me when you need something,

I must admit on some occasions
I went out like a punk and a chump
Or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect I used to never get
'Cause all I got was upset
When n-used to be like
(What's up, fool? N-, what's up?)

And tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip
For no reason at all I can recall n- throwing C's in my face
Down the hall I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eating chicken at three
Wondering, ""Why is everybody always pickin' on me?
I tried to talk and tell them, chill, I did nothin' to deserve this
But when it didn't work, I wasn't scared, just real nervous and unprepared

To deal with scrappin' no doubt
My pappy never told me how to knock a n-out
But now in '95 I must survive as a man on my own
F- around with Fatlip, yes, ya get blown
I'm not tryin' to show no macho is shown
But when it's on, if it's on, then it's on

Can't keep running away

One, two so listen here
There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta handle shit up on his own
Can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
Please, they got problems of their own
Down for the count on seven chicken sh- don't get to heaven
'Til they faced these fears in these fear zones
Used to get jacked back up in high school, I played it cool

Just so some real sh-won't get full blown bein' where I'm from
They let the smoke come quicker than an evil redneck
Could lynch a helpless colored figure and
As a victim I invented low-key
Till the keyhole itself got lower than me
So I stood up and let my free form form free
Said I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me
I don't sweat it, I let the bullsh- blow in the breeze
In other words, just debris

Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away

It's 1995
And now that I'm older, stress weighs on my shoulders
Heavy as boulders, but I told y'all
Until the day that I die I still
Will be a soldier and that's all I told ya
And that's all I showed ya
And that's all I sold ya
And all this calamity is rippin' my sanity

Can it be (that I'm a celebrity who's on the brink of insanity?)
Now don't be wishin' of switchin' any positions with me
'Cause when you in my position, it ain't never easy
To do any type of maintainin'
'Cause all this gamin' and famin' from entertainin'
Is hella strainin' (to the brain and)

My pockets is mean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy

Don't leave nothing unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she getting knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dipping with that
Uh, down-shifting on 'em like I got gears on me

(Run!) Scared to death, running like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timbs start feeling like they Nike Airs on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the Thruway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm trying to hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm ashmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
Imagine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

A delayed reaction
When she left her craft voluntarily
For your nest, for your love
Did you understand?

Appreciate
Build a bridge to her
Initiate a touch

When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong

Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes calling
And negativity lands

Cold cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passing through

And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

Mutual misunderstanding
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act

We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through

And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word

The catalyst, thought with the knack for splashin'
I'm dashin' I mastered the craft of mashin'
The level-headed through bred, the female's passion

Or would it be the same for you like I was Eric Clapton, huh?

Clap for your freedom dog, that's what's happening
My spit take critical political action
The hustle is a puzzle each piece is a fraction
And every word that's understood is a transaction

I'm an S.P. soldier, microphone holder
Rep Philly set from Bolivia to Boulder
Paris, France to Tip and Tioga
How we gonna make it through the dark, I show ya

I tell you one lesson I learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice and

Ooh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly, if you want to be high

Listen, yo kick off your shoes, jump off the jock
I fly higher than them dudes, from off your block
My name Black, the style is unorthodox
It tap chins in your mens till you thought could box

A couple of people wanted thought to stop, but guess what?
My man grab the missile, plug for the gut
Now next time beatty stop being such a glut
I'm precise with it like Faheim with haircuts

We up close on 'em with toast but no crust
It's fructose on 'em they froze and won't bust
Choke on your face you jewels is lack lust
Got to put it to you straight, y'all fools is jacked up

Came close to the utmost but no cigar
Nose to the grindstone, head to the stars
The number one runner with the number one drummer
Grammy award winnin' it's the world's eighth wonder, come on

I tell you one lesson I learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice and

Ooh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly, if you want to be high

Your first impression might be I'm a asshole
Or say I'm sometimey and give people a hassle
Or try to sun touch and put the heat in the capsule
Dog I'm far deeper than that though, I get in the zone

Recognize I'm a rolling stone
No time to lolly gag or lounge with scaliwags
Give me the disc or I put it where your body at
Old school spit flow laid over Trotter tracks

With no apology fraud or trick-knowledgy
Just trust, what I see and I say and follow me my way
I read an open booklet inside me
The star of the story that the groove teller got me

Through all the dark times part of the business
The light be contingent on small forensics
My microphone'll make a man a newborn infant
It's true so the crew gon' sense it, I get in the zone

I tell you one lesson I learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice and

Ooh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry

What we don't see
Well it can't be real
What we don't touch we cannot feel

But it's all just the same at the end of the day
And we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong
So we don't ask why
Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day

Something I can give
I know I'd help you if I can
If you're honest and you say that you did
You know that I would give you my hand
Or a sad song
In a lonely place
I'll try to put a word in for you
Need a shoulder? well if that's the case
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do

My true love did breathe by the Sally Ann so softly
That while walkin' through town
Only my heart did hear him
In views of the city

There ain't many folks by the Sally Ann so pretty
That while walkin' through town
Many a twisted feature
Made a terrible beauty, beauty

And then I knew
And then I knew
I'd been there before

One thing you must know by the Sally Ann directly
Is that the pockets don't hold any more sunken treasures
After baptism by whiskey

But when leaving the bar by the Sally Ann just barely
That old angel may allow light from above the mountain
And red brick walls blooming, you might see
And then you'll know

Couldn't even find himself a room

We are one, we move as a unit, this is our mic, we are one!

Killah Priest We fight the ungodly (Salvation)
With the righteous sword of justice
And we will follow him all the days of our life (Salvation)
We are one, we move as a unit, this is our mic, we are one!

The plot was to stop the Nazarene break up his black regime
Smash his dreams from being the greatest that rap has seen
They laugh while scheming on ways to stop him having cream
That's blasphemy to not mention his name in magazines
Luckily the young warrior had mad esteem
He kept writing, back in his lab he hit his pad extreme
And in the midst of all the chaos he took half his team
Called'em Black Market and Maccabeez (This is my mic)
While the serpent use the worldly things to attract his queen
Broke his heart she played the part Mary Magdalene
Hissing his words that the other side of the grass was green
But I ain't trying to hold you baby go ahead flap your wings
Gun in the waist of his baggy jeans stayed strapped
Yankee cap above his durag lean
Police that pass flash sirens outside his projects
Where the dealers push crack to fiends
There he did some soul searching now he's back redeemed
Look at his album cover stained glass of the King
Wallpapers of gangsters hang up
Next to King Solomon Amen Ra and King Tut
Beneath that incense burns frank incense the fragrance of the prince
Priests the saint the angels fight in his defense light the hemp
It's bright take a glimpse at the crouching statues

Within the tall fence of his castle

We are one, we move as a unit, this is our mic, we are one!

I called on Michael, Gabriel and Uriel to pull me from Hell
A jury of twelve await my burial
They said they want my great material
My vision blurry can't tell I hear the bells near the church steeple
Where Rafael awaits his fate break the curse of evil
I'm holding rosemary beads it's scary roll the hairy weed
Inside the blackberry leaves
Its cold but what worries me will my crew leave when they bury me come hurry see
The Brotherhood climbing a hillside at the fall of darkness
The night arches over the projects
As they speak of the legacy of Priest the artist
They share words of his hardship
And he sung his psalms to a harpist
His garment was blood soaked
Around his crown he wore halo of blunt smoke below his navel his guns poked
So may this Offering give your thoughts wings?
May it fly high start soaring pass the corpse of kings
Beyond the cloud scraping mountains, travel the way of the falcon
To a tucked away enchanted Island
You land see the ruins of his old palace
The wide stone steps that leads to his throne
You see his face made of hard stone, he just sit there and zone
My eyes are open but they're empty as the painted eyes on a doll
Walk inside the fog sit beside my catalogue
See his face? It aged to something strange come in range
Upon his sculpture grows weed vines with small rosebuds
So show love to the Priest (Salvation) revelations (My Salvation) and this is my salvations, This is my salvation

'King of Mysteries, who wast and art
Before the elements, before the ages
King eternal, comely in aspect

Keenness to discern your will
Wisdom to understand it
Courage to follow where it leads.

Halte fest - und folge mir!

So - wie ich Dich
Durchflute mich - verschwende Dich
Halt mich fest - ich folge Dir
So - wie ich Dich
Erstürme mich - ergieße Dich
Halte fest - und folge mir!

Ich - hab' mir vertraut
Und doch hab' ich mir nicht geglaubt
Der Strom der mich umspülte
Und der mich hierher führte
Versickert tief im Grund

Ich komme nicht zur Ruhe
Verfluche meine unendlich -
Tatenlose unverfälschte Suche
Nach dem Ziel das viel zu fern
Und doch zu Füßen mir erscheint
Verloren stehe ich im Spiegel
Aufgebrannt erkenn' ich meine
Tatenlose unerfüllte Leere
Wie ein Wolf - als wenn ich etwas suchte
Das zu finden sich noch lohnte

Hier - trage ich
So wie Du mich - in den Tag
Hier sind wir fremd - und verbrannt
Im Morgenlicht - das uns zerbricht
Halte fest am meinem Blick!"

That's heaven to me
You don't know my girl
But she's right as right can be

It's like yonder mockingbird
In the cottonwood tree
You don't change that, no
It's meant to be

And that's the soul of a southern girl
Gonna set you free

When we go walking
On a summer's eve
We take the long way home
That's guaranteed

Thinking about Sarah
That's heaven to me
Thinking about my Sarah girl
She is love to me

Sitting there by her window
Sunshine in her hair
Sun can't help but love her
In fact I think he's jealous of her
Because he's just passing through
And she is ever Sarah

And that's the soul of a southern girl
Gonna set you free

Sure as that river
Is gonna run to the sea
Sure as the sun's gonna shine
She's thre for me

Thinking about Sarah
That's heaven to me
Thinking about my Sarah girl
She is love she is love

Like those lazy willows
Playong in the summer breeze
She's got that that easy rhythm
Swinging right along with them
But they're just melodies
In the symphony called Sarah

She sets me free
And that's the soul of
My southern girl
And she sets me free"

Me and Sarah my best friend
Stripy tights and fairy wings
As safe as safe can be

We drank the gin we'd snuck in
Danced to Ben Folds Five
I turned around to Sarah
Couldn't see her anywhere
As safe as safe can be

Oh Sarah, I didn't mean to let you down
But you left me on my own, Sarah
Why didn't you scream?

I went to all the stages
And to the St. John's stand
The man said ""You just missed her
Stay - maybe she'll come back again""
I sat and watched the crowds

My father came at midnight
We searched til half-past four
I was half hysterical
My father wasn't sure
He called for the police

Oh Sarah, I didn't mean to let you down
But you left me on my own, Sarah
Why didn't you scream? Why didn't you shout?
Sarah, I hate it that I let you down
But you left me on my own, Sarah
Why didn't you scream? Why didn't you shout?
Why didn't you shout?

The next day the sergeant
Found her blue dress in the creek
Her parents were so angry
They put the blame on me

Then a fortnight later
Sarah knocked upon their door
Her mother asked her ""Where've you been?""
And she said
""I don't know, I don't know, I'm not sure.
I'm not sure, I can't remember anything at all.""

Oh Sarah, I didn't mean to let you down
But you left me on my own, Sarah
Why didn't you scream? Why didn't you shout?
Sarah, I hate it that I let you down
But you left me on my own, Sarah
Why didn't you scream? Why didn't you shout?"

'Cause the blind are never free

I think you forgot how bright you are

The sky is battered and bruised
But I'm still hanging on all because of you
Cause you held up the sun
And you never let go
The world needs you now more than you'll ever know

When I saw you in a
Mirror humming like a
Jet plane coming overhead
A rooftop faraway at night
Coming coming coming bright
Like a swirly eye-shape on
A simulated wood-grain god
In a dazzling form of flames
Recurring dream where I saw you
And nothing happens but I do
See the sun
In your heart
Feel the shine
Above
And if she laughs with happy
Little bubble colors
Bursting silent like a star
Shut your eyes and some things change
Skeletons will rearrange
See the sun
In your heart
Feel the shine
Above

Was the rhythm-less rave of your cloven hoofed babe
Calling to you from the street.
And she taunts you as she danced
Your genitals in the dirt.
Your paternal heart aches as your bones bend and break
But the beating barely hurts.

So desperate to love but you just can't pretend
That her hands weren't claws.
Your Madonna was Medusa in the end.

Shiver yeah, you'll shiver through the night.

Left me alone and I can't forgive them

Is you end up on your own

That the night had blown in a vision a siren in black
With green velvet eyes and a porcelain smile
The fireflies danced in her hair

She said, ""Please can you help me
I'm lost and I've nowhere to go
Please can you be the kindest soul?""

Well, I couldn't resist her undauntable charm
As she brushed passed me through the door
There was something inside
Burned, I just couldn't hide

I'd never seen beauty before
""Please can I stay
For my body is weak to the bone
And can you tell me are we alone?""

Heaven is only one kiss away
And I can take you as long as we stay

Well, the first lie I told
Was my wife had been gone
One year ago to this day
And I still hear her cries in the trembling night
And the nightmares just won't go away

Please come close
And look deep in my eyes
And I watched them turn black as night

Heaven is only one kiss away
And I can take you as long as we stay
Heaven is only one kiss away
Hells here on earth boy so drink for today

Well I watched her lay sprawling
Beckoning and calling
Burning holes right through the floor
And the wind started howling
And my hands started shaking

And the smell of death rose through the air
This is the last thing that I'll ask of you
Embrace me tonight and let us take flight

Her siren song seeped slowly into my head
As I drew her close to my lips
And as they gently touched I felt a terrible rush
As the life was crushed right from my heart

With my last breath I watched
The black angel of death
Spread her wings in bliss
For she had stolen my soul through a kiss

Heaven is only one kiss away
And I can take you as long as we stay
Heaven is only one kiss away

Beat a frantic pace
And it's not even seven AM
You're feeling the rush of anguish settling
You cannot help showing them in
Hurry up then
Or you'll fall behind and
They will take control of you
And you need to heal the hurt behind your eyes
Fickle words crowding your mind
So
Sleep, sugar, let your dreams flood in
Like waves of sweet fire, you're safe within
Sleep, sweetie, let your floods come rushing in
And carry you over to a new morning
Try as you might
You try to give it up
Seems to be holding on fast
It's hand in your hand
A shadow over you
A beggar for soul in your face
Still it don't mater if you won't listen
If you won't let them follow you
You just need to heal
Make good all your lies
Move on and don't look behind
So
Sleep, sugar, let your dreams flood in
Like waves of sweet fire, you're safe within
Sleep, sweetie, let your floods come rushing in
And carry you over to a new morning
Day after day
Fickle visions messing with your head
Fickle, vicious
Sleeping in your bed

Are you there

I know it's late
So please forgive my persistence
But I'm hanging
Do you care

So lay back
Call off the attack
Cause if you look deep
Dreams are nothing that I lack
And all I seek
A final chance to speak
And I would let the whole thing keep
If I could just sleep

Hey there you
Way out there could you show me
Just a signal
Or a sign
That after all
All these years
That you know me
And I'm not just
Killing time

So lay back
Call off the attack
Cause if you look deep
Dreams are nothing that I lack
And all I seek
A final chance to speak
And I would let the whole thing keep

And as I lay there at night
Building castles in the air

And a red little girl's at the top of a slide
And an an orange old man at the bottom
Wants to take her for a ride
As she slips and she tumbles the orange man mumbles
Pennies crash down from the sky
And he tells her he'll take her away where it's safe
And of course it is a lie
She's a third the down and her skirts are yanked up
And her little girl cheeks start to wrinkle
But her smile is wide and her legs are spread wider
Her hair growing long and her hips getting larger
Past getting brighter
Light growing weaker

She is halfway down now but the man is impatient
Shakes change in his pocket he might have to wait but she's coming
She's coming
She's coming

Who are you blaming?
They're just playing!
That's a good one
Who left the playground
A good decade before the bell rang?

As she starts to draw nearer the view becomes clearer
The splinters are painful but she doesn't feel it
The pennies were loaded and as they exploded
She starts to spin out of control...
Her eyes are now closing her sleeves are unrolling
Up past her head and her veins are all showing
Not that she noticed she's thoroughly focused on
One old man who's laughing...
Who's laughing
Who's laughing
Don't worry
I've got you
Don't worry
I've got you
Don't worry

Prodigy performer, musically divine
Classical composer, innovative each time
Gifted individual, say no more
Going through the motions feeling sad on tour
Scared of the fame, pressure on the brain
Rhyming backstage when they introduce his name
House lights go down, everybody claps
Fuck it, the show goes on and that'll be that
Smile for the camera, running down the classics
Close out the show climactic with backflips
Thunderous applause for the audience that amazes
Inside the mind, though, he's going through changes
Suicidal thoughts while the audience is loving
Their source of amusement, he feels disillusioned

He gives the show of his life, though he's breaking down
Although you'd never know it
But there's something different about him now
He's painted his smile on upside down"

In a photo frame I'm losing again
I'm losing my friend
His face down on the pavement

Then a woman, she screams 'It's a terrible night'
As the mood changes to dark from light
Tell the doctor what's become of me
So they can analyse, analyse my dreams

Of a smoke filled room

Of a smoke filled room

Then we kiss and his lips turn into sand
And the whole of him cascades through my hands
Making a castle on the floor
Then I'm alone again
No keys and three doors

In a smoke filled room

Now we're both in the room
And we're breathing the fumes
No doors this time, just a gap in the roof
Light floods in, heaven we're blind

Then slowly suffocating, we're dying

Morning mist laying dead

On naked shoulders
No flowers, no thorns

Hey love, stay the fuck out of my home
I've told you a thousand times
'Cause my brain tells me you're dangerous
And my belly says you're just too hard to find

Something tells me this smoke is here to stay

Romanticized as always
I cannot afford not to invest in myself

When I need me most you need me more

Wake up without a blink
To an even pace where nothing moves
Except the pressure from a funky saturday
Dropping like bricks on my head
Or over the milkyway
Starlit electric beams had only just touched me
I must have dreamt myself astray
The only milkyway I have is in the middle of the day
Chorus:

Somedays are better than somedays
Good Sundays are better than somedays
Today I'd even take a bad Monday
Cause this Sunday's a pure pressure inside of me

Danced till my feet were blue
To erase the thoughts I just remember you
Tears lost in the turn of the years
Return on days like this
Kissing in the sunrays
I knew that it was Sunday
Cause my memory's like blueprint in my head
Chorus

(And the little rap says)
Give me grits and eggs give me ham and bacon
And a pancake with some maple syrup
Cause it is Sunday
(God knows what the dogs are saying)
We made it thru... maybe"

It helps to think we're sleeping, underneath the same big sky

song of joy,nick cave & the bad seeds,Already processed,"Have mercy on me, sir
Allow me to impose on you
I have no place to stay
And my bones are cold right through
I will tell you a story
Of a man and his family
And I swear that it is true
Ten years ago I met a girl named Joy
She was a sweet and happy thing
Her eyes were bright blue jewels
And we were married in the spring
I had no idea what happiness a little love could bring
Or what life had in store
But all things move toward their end
All things move toward their end
On that you can be sure
Hit it!
Then one morning I awoke to find her weeping
And for many days to follow
She grew so sad and lonely
Became Joy in name only
Within her breast there launched an unnamed sorrow
And a dark and grim force set sail
Farewell happy fields
Where joy forever dwells
Hail horrors hail
Was it an act of contrition or some awful premonition
As if she saw into the heart of her final blood-soaked night
Those lunatic eyes, that hungry kitchen knife
Ah, I see, sir, that I have your attention!
Well, could it be?
How often I’ve asked that question
Well, then in quick succession
We had babies, one, two, three
We called them Hilda, Hattie and Holly
They were their mother’s children
Their eyes were bright blue jewels
And they were quiet as a mouse
There was no laughter in the house
No, not from Hilda, Hattie or Holly
“No wonder”, people said, “poor mother Joy’s so melancholy”
Well, one night there came a visitor to our little home
I was visiting a sick friend
I was a doctor then
Joy and the girls were on their own
Yeah
Oh yeah
Joy had been bound with electrical tape
In her mouth a gag
She’d been stabbed repeatedly
And stuffed into a sleeping bag
In their very cots my girls were robbed of their lives
Method of murder much the same as my wife’s
Yeah, method of murder much the same as my wife’s
It was midnight when I arrived home
Said to the police on the telephone
Someone’s taken four innocent lives
They never caught the man
He’s still on the loose
It seems he has done many many more
Quotes John Milton on the walls in the victim’s blood
The police are investigating at tremendous cost
In my house he wrote, “red right hand”
That, I’m told is from Paradise Lost
The wind round here gets wicked cold
But my story is nearly told
I fear the morning will bring quite a frost
And so I’ve left my home
I drift from land to land
I am upon your step and you are a family man
Outside the vultures wheel
The wolves howl, the serpents hiss
And to extend this small favour, friend
Would be the sum of earthly bliss
Do you reckon me a friend?
The sun to me is dark
And silent as the moon
Do you, sir, have a room?
Are you beckoning me in?
Hit it!

Just say the word and I'll strip

Then when I wake up, I'm all covered in sex
With eyes that fall somewhere between rubies and stars
Don't look at me, baby, or I'll flex

We rented a car and left our bands
And drove outside the city

It was the stars and you

When I went away you made me a book
Full of goodnight letters
I answered each one and we made plans
For when we'd be together
But when we wanted more
And told you I wasn't sure
It started a storm
You think it's all my fault

And everything is free and there were still so many things to see
So many things so many things left to be very small drop in the

Rather than the lies rather that the cruelty
That sometimes we were guilty of as everybody knows
We were only young and really couldn't have known

And from my house
As I look out
The stars align

You make me wanna measure stars
In the backyard
With a calculator and a ruler, baby
I found a letter that describes
How the moonlight will lead me
To a distant place that you will be

The open sky
Is mine tonight
It gives a sign
Of what I'll find

The open sky
Is mine tonight
It gives a sign
Of what I'll find

You make me wanna measure stars

stars,fun.,Already processed,"Growing old is getting old
I often find myself here thinking
About the birds, the boats, and past loves that flew away or started sinking
And it's crazy here without you
I used to think this all was ours
We'd stay up late, debate on how we'd find our way
Say it's all up in the stars
Some nights I rule the world
With bar lights and pretty girls
But most nights I stay straight and think about my mom
Oh God, I miss her so much
And there are people on the street
They're coming up to me
They're telling me that they like what I do now
And so I tried my best when I took the phone
To get right back up, back in your arms
If you're out here why do I miss you so much
I feel like I had it all
Back before I lost it all
Now I just wait for you to talk to me
But you won't even look at me, baby
And I'd be saying that you
You're always holding on to stars
I think they're better from afar
'Cause no one is gonna save us
Oh, and me
Well, I have faded in the dark
So don't you ever kiss me
Don't you wish on me
Why can't you see that no one's gonna save us?
Oh, come on girl
I just need a helping hand
I close my eyes and think about tomorrow
It never came true
It came true
It never came true
Oh, and you
You're always holding on to stars
You're always holding on to stars
'Cause no one is gonna save us
Oh, and you (You)
You're always holding on to stars
I think they're better from afar
Because no one is gonna save us
Oh, and me
I have faded in the dark
So don't you ever kiss me
Don't you wish on me
Why can't you see that no one's gonna save us?
No one's gonna save us
No one's gonna save me now
No, no, no
No, no, no
No one's gonna save us
Who we are, who we are
Who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are
You're always holding on to stars
You're always holding on to stars
You're always holding on to stars
You're always holding on to stars
You're always holding on to stars

stars,janis ian,Already processed,"I was never one for singing
what I really feel
Except tonight, I'm bringing
everything I know that's real

Stars, they come and go
They come fast or slow
They go like the last light
of the sun, all in a blaze
and all you see is glory
But it gets lonely there
when there's no one here to share
We can shake it away
if you'll hear a story

People lust for fame
Like athletes in a game
we break our collarbones
and come up swinging
Some of us are downed
Some of us are crowned
and some are lost
and never found
But most have seen it all
They live their lives in
sad cafes and music halls
They always have a story

Some make it when they're young
before the world has
done its dirty job
and later on, someone will say
""You've had your day
You must make way""
But they'll never know the pain
of living with a name you never owned
or the many years forgetting
what you know too well

The ones who gave the crown
have been let down
You try to make amends
without defending

Perhaps pretending
you never saw the eyes
of grown men of twenty five
that followed as you walked
and asked for autographs
or kissed you on the cheek
and you never could believe
they really loved you

Some make it when they're old
(Perhaps they have a soul
they're not afraid to bare
Or perhaps there's nothing there)

Some women have a body
men will want to see,
so they put it on display
Some people play a fine guitar
I could listen to them
play all day
Some ladies really
move across a stage
and gee, they sure can dance
I guess I could learn how
if I have it half a chance

but I always feel so funny
when my body tries to soar
and I seem to always worry
about missing the next chord

I guess there isn't anything
to put up on display
except the tunes
and whatever else I say
Anyway, that isn't really
what I meant to say
I meant to tell a story
I live from day to day

Stars, they come and go
They come fast or slow
They go like the last light
of the sun, all in a blaze
and all you see is glory
But those who've seen it all
they live their lives
in sad cafes and music halls
we always have a story

So if you don't lose patience
with my fumbling around,
I'll come up singing for you
even when I'm down"

High, lift 'em up high, okay

When that adrenaline get in they system
It get 'em out on a quest for Stardom, could be a motherfuckin problem
In Philly, Cincinatti, Los Angeles or Harlem
Kids call theyself killers let they hammers do the talkin
Don't even know the meaning of life, ain't seen a thing
And you dream of floodin the scenery with, llello and greenery
But for now, you stickin her with the heavy machinery
Wonder how, you lift it up, be only 17
And like e'rybody he wanna shine, young brothers on the grind
Holdin somethin in they spine, ""Bowling for Columbine""
Stressin to me how it's all about a dollar sign
Dig the way you out of line, out of sight and out of mind
Up against the clock and damn near out of time
""The Tipping Point"" has arrived, and that's the bottom line
To all my peoples that's Stars, it's our time to shine
Let's get 'em up high, c'mon

I'm deprogrammin y'all with uncut slang shit

Twist some cool champagne, I'm goin through changes
A grown-ass man, I done paid my dues
Learn the rules lil' homey, you could be one too
Niggaz know, ain't no tellin what he gon' do
But recognize young bruh, I'ma do it for you
You know why? We all Stars and we highly evolved
Hip-Hop, it's not pop like Kylie Minogue
If it bang, them gettin-busy brothers probably involved
In the game, where e'rybody got a shottie to draw
I guess you probably a thug, you boss ballin or what?
I can't call it man, I got the ladies fallin in love
Cause handsome, intelligent, tough - I'm all the above
I know you knew it it's the movement
Groove to it while you doin it up

Introducin the band you gotta see to believe
He got the mic in his hand, so keep the heat up your sleeve
It's Black Thought, he rockin sharp so the speakers'll bleed
I run a triathalon, you wouldn't see me fatigued
I'm a Star, and maybe y'all should cop somethin to be
Or trade some of y'all equipment in for somethin you need
Cause it's a, lot of bullshit floodin the scene
Where e'rybody's a Star, and hot shit is few and far between
We lose the grip of what, garbage mean
Shorties wanna be theyself, I know it's hard to be
Don't wanna do the Ruben Studdard and come off less threatenin
Keepin it real'll kill you if you end up lettin it
Ain't it blowin your mind how the game all in line
Now the best, to the rest, we fin' to end up settin it
I'd tell you that I was a veteran but it's evident
You act like you want it, you gon' end up gettin it

And I've been to hell and back

Take me so very far from home
And I woke up one summer day and I fell in love

I get the feeling that there's more to this one's life
There's some kind of complication, he tells her he's alone
Spends the night with his lover, there's a trace of her cologne
And the words of his mistress, as she whispers them so near
Start ringing in my ear

Please take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own
You promised one day we could its, what you said on the phone
I'm just a prisoner of love always hid from the light
Take me dancing, please take me dancing tonight

I imagine his wife, she don't look nothing like a fool
She picks the kids up form some private school
She remembers what he told her, he was late and worked alone
But there's more than a suspicion in this lingering cologne
And the kid's just won't be quiet and she runs a traffic light
And she drives into the night

Please take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own
You promised one day we could it's what you said on the phone
I'm just a prisoner of love always hid from the light

So why am I ten feet under and upside down?
Barely surviving has become my purpose
'Cause I'm so used to living underneath the surface

Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh

For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop
Here is a strage and bitter crop"

dirty strands to veil the face,
small tattoos named big mistakes,
she whispers when she talks,
strangling bottles of escape,

Black pearls and I swear you were drinkin' beer

It's hard to maintain the pressure on my chest
Excess frustration strikes!
Blood rushes my head when I come across roads
With dead mics and wack promoted shows it's hard
But with the presence of God

I'm true to the game
So I'm back black, to take charge, and recap-ture
The time, wish it could never be wack, I'm pure
I insert my lifeline into the track, the energy
In me is a poison with no un-revealed remedy
I'm spreading, like leprosy, throughout the record label

'Cause mines put me and Monch's career in jeopardy
Can you come see me in the ghetto where it's dark
Bullets are real lost peeps lurks in the heart
Lord knows it hurts, we kick the Hertz to the curb
Execute first things first, and put blunted minds to work
My herd's tight and my fans supports
So I'm a-ight, for the time being seeing peace
But taking no shorts (no shorts)

After this rhyme, henceforth, there is none
No more will exist, when I emerge
From the mist in whence I was born into, scorned
Most of you can't even comprehend what I am saying
To you even in my human form the message I'm relaying

Why do you choose to mimic these wack MC's?
Why do you choose to listen to R&B?
Why must you believe that something is fat
Just because it's played on the radio, 20 times per day?
My perception of poetical injection is ejaculation
The Immaculate Conception
The hall walker, who stalks bodies in Central Park

Soon emergency services'll outline that body in chalk
Then I begin to walk away and spit
Then when I walk away I talk shit!
Huh, a driver sprayed my face with mace
She didn't know that I enjoyed the taste of radioactive waste
When I'm in the backseat of your mid-town taxi
Don't even ask me for the cash G
The four cabs before didn't pick me up

And finally to me
You ask me what I'm drinking

My friend Johnny
Tugging on my sleeve
Asks if I wanna leave
But what I'm really thinking is

Why can't it be easy
Easy
Why don't you leave
Leave me
Leave me be
I can see you swaying
I can't hear what you're saying

I'm sitting here stuck
And plastered to my seat
I think up a reason to leave
When you finally stop speaking
I'll take a long slow
Walk down Washington Street
Half asleep on my feet
Half aware if I'm dreaming

I'll go home alone
A sinking stone
A swithed off telephone
I'll go on and be free
A frozen breeze
A fallen down factory
But I still see you swaying
And I can't hear what you're saying

I just lost the plot
Got a little caught
In a little knot
I just hit a wall
Had a little fall
Felt the swinging wrecking ball
And why should that be
Why don't you tell me
Why don't you tell me
I'm sure you'll tell me
Why don't you tell me
I guess you'll tell me
Tell me"

But there'll be fireworks when you come home

I never asked to be alone
It's the truth I can do without
Getting harder to admit
Love, I can do without
I'm up in my neck and ear

I'm stuck
Till you make your mind up
Till you make your mind up
I'm stuck

Well you can shake it till it rains dIamonds
And you can shake it till it turns gold
Will you shake all the bitter lies
Will it taste like lips of gold

Cause it's the proof that without a doubt
It's too late to pray
Love, I can't breathe it out
I'm up to my neck in this shit

I'm stuck
Till you make your mind up
Till you make your mind up
I'm stuck

And I don't know if I can do it by myself
I just feel like I'm responsible
And I don't know if I can do it by myself
I feel loved but I'm not capable
And how can I breath
Till you make your mind up
How can I think of leaving you when

I'm stuck
Till you make your mind up
Till you make your mind up
I'm stuck

I'm stuck...
I'm stuck..."

De repente en mí vida
Hay algo que me tiene confundida
No lo puedo evitar, puedo intentar
Conservar el asombro hasta el final

Mil palabras ya he oído
Solo las tuyas no han desvanecido
No puedo escapar de sus sonidos
Estoy hipnotizada en un sueño contínuo
Otros corazones no han tenido miedo
Solo el tuyo es el que quiero
Haré todo para cuidar tu amor
Quizás será una tontería, no tengo temor

De repente en mí vida
Hay algo que me tiene confundida
No lo puedo evitar, puedo intentar
Conservar el asombro hasta el final

Mil veces quise estar sola
Vivir sin tu amor aunque sea una hora
Cada vez vuelve el llanto
Regreso a tí, es que te quiero tanto
Mil pensamientos giran a mi alrededor
Hacen que se sienta paz interior
Al pensar el porque de esta situación
En tus besos encuentro la solución

One bowl ought to fill me up
But that milk gotta be cold enough
So supper time that'll hold me up
I might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but

Honey, you look like a honeydew melon
Or strawberry with the whipped cream filling
Of the top part of the peach cobbler
But uh, the fruit platter ought to do me better

To melt the frozen prison round this fool who never learns
Every living thing that's born must have its end

Decreasing circles from stones I threw
And greasy skin shines in the sun
Today's the day and you're the one

And then I feel like lying down so still
Making shapes from clouds in the sky with you

And when the sun has gone away

I taste a raindrop in my mouth
I pick you up and the sky comes down

Sunday morning
Slow beats seething
Through the screens in
The open windows
Eggs frying
Legs shaking
After we stayed lying
So long in bed
Sunday morning
Both of us reading
And looking up occasionally
Looking up occasionally

Sunday morning
You're doing your thing
And I am doing mine
Speaking words
More a formality
'Cause we can feel we
Are of one mind
Sunday morning
Sheets still warm
Kitties swarming
Around our feet
Life comes easy
Your sweet company
Making it so complete
Of all the Monday through Fridays
We joined the crusade
Of all the Saturday nights
In which we were made
Of all the exorcisms
I've done with your ghosts
Still it's Sunday morning
I miss you the most

I learnt a lot of tricks to help me live my life
You helped me find my paradise
When you came, you were like

Sunshine through my window
That's what you are
My shining star

Making me feel
I'm on top of the world
Telling me I'll go far

Reaching out, for new heights
You inspired me to try
Felt the magic inside
And I felt that I could fly
I'm looking at the world in an optimistic light
You made me appreciate my life
'Cos when you came you were like

Sunshine through my window
That's what you are

Telling me I'll go far

You are the calm
I am the storm
You are the breeze that carries me on
When I set adrift
You anchor me
You're there for me

To write a letter to the heads of the government, government

To her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her

And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you wanna be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China

And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When He walked upon the water
And He spent a long time watching
From His lonely wooden tower

And when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could see Him
He said, ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""

But He Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust Him
For He's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now, Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From the Salvation Army counters

And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers

There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind"

You take the shrill echo away when I pray for better luck.
We'll soar from bridges to the swans,
Our bullets into the water become the bird of song.

You can call this a Swan song.

I love the way you are late.
I'm coming home for Christmas, to hold open your weight.

Takes a little longer
Walk before the house where we had our games
Suffering life, play, making, we discovered fire

People like you made me so much stronger
People like you made me question blame
Huddled in strength like birds on a sloping wire

Hearing your voice makes me so uneasy
Hearing your voice makes me question fame
Money is deaf to the sound of a lover's cry

The language of loss made me so much older
The language of loss made me lose my grip
The language of loss made me silent as a newborn child

'Cause everything moves in a shifting cycle
The unison soars and the pressure dips
Making our way steadfast in the skyward mile

And baby I know I will see you someday
Building your house on the very street
You severed your mother's life from your father's land

Finish your home we can join them this way
We talked about peace and a little dream
Marriage and love and divorce we don't understand

And you know I have to sway my leaves and branches slowly
Out in the sun, like the silent shout of youth

And we ask why do we take these leaps and chances
Because we have no choice but to wither into truth

And I dreamed you were there
All the vital signs were standing
When I dreamed you were with me
With the summer at my back

And I dreamed you were there
So complete and undemanding
We know the love that gives
Is what the living always lack

And you know I have to sway my leaves and branches slowly
Out in the sun, like the silent shout of youth

And we ask why do we take these leaps and chances

Never hope to be

And the cost ain't cheap, my advice is priceless
Bring back the life that you thought was lifeless
'The Way of the Gun', son, who the nicest?
S.K., no stun gun, smooth devices
Time Crisis, I played the game, low lifers
In a brawl, ripped the phones out the walls in Riker's
Vipers in the infirmary rooms with slicers
Shiesters with hate in their blood might bite you
Fuck that bitch, your wife don't write your
Cancel her, buy another one just like her
Pipers in the bucket of ice taste righteous
Today's mathematics when we build in cyphers
The baby automatic kill like Air Force strikers
I'm still Asiatic when I spill the hypeness
The dark and this place will come here
That's right
First we told y'all niggas, then we showed y'all niggas, huh?
We gon' take it back with this
By the time you get a show, we've been all around the globe, huh?
We gon' take it back with this
Before you even had a name, you was screamin', ""Wu-Tang""

Answer our call in desperate hours
Shelter our fall from earthly powers
Temper our souls with flame and furnace
Bear us toward a noble purpose

Formless and vanquished we shall travel
Shield and sword will guide our battle

Went on to create and perfect the unexpected
Funky beat sound watch the family ""Get down!""
Slide with the right and give cousin a pound
Watch the young ones play and think back in the day

And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue

That you can do but that ain't the truth

I turn the doorknob with two fingers to be slow
Enough to sneak into the room among the corner darkness gloom
I had to see this happening
He pushed himself so deep inside her clapping rang
And bounced off every wooden walled room

And that's when all went silent blank except the color red
As I walked calmly numbing paralyzed beside the bed
I said, ""I know I'm not allowed to be here
I just had to see how good your new man really fucks you
'Cause you both been fucking me""

""So now I planned this last thing you can both do as a pair
I tie both blindfolds tight around your fucking eyes to blind your stare
I don't want to alarm you, but I figured we could end this
In what seems easy, quick and painless, man
So I'll get down to business""

""I choose you first, there's a gun, it's at your head
So laugh at me one more time but your face inside the bed
You sit and watch me while I do this shit and learn from what I've said""
I cocked the pistol, pulled the trigger, and all I saw was red

How far will I go
To make it feel right?
I come home
I have to fix this on my own

Then the screaming, oh, the screaming
""It's nice to see you scared of such a weak and stupid husband
Who knows you never really cared
I'll leave you with a question that I need to hear from your head
Was all this worth it knowing you have just seconds left to live?""

""Now think about your answer, lying face down on the bed""
I cocked the pistol, pulled the trigger and all I saw was red
I gently stroke her arm as she lies lifeless on her back
Then I placed the barrel in my mouth, all I saw was black"

So, to escape it I
I went back to bed

the funeral,javier navarrete,Already processed,LYRICS_NOT_FOUND
the gift,the velvet underground,Already processed,"Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit.
It was now mid-August which meant that he had been separated from Marsha for more than two months.
Two months, and all he had to show were three dog-eared letters and two very expensive long-distance phone calls.
True, when school had ended and she'd returned to Wisconsin and he to Locust, Pennsylvania she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity.
She would date occasionally, but merely as amusement.
She would remain faithful. But lately Waldo had begun to worry.
He had trouble sleeping at night and when he did, he had horrible dreams.
He lay awake at night, tossing and turning underneath his printed quilt protector, tears welling in his eyes,
As he pictured Marsha, her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothings of some Neanderthal,
Finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion. It was more than the human mind could bear.

Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him.
Daytime fantasies of sexual abandon permeated his thoughts.
And the thing was, they wouldn't understand who she really was.
He, Waldo, alone, understood this.
He had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche.
The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers Parade was scheduled to appear.
He had just finished mowing and edging the Edelsons lawn for a dollar-fifty
And had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from Marsha.

There was nothing more than a circular form the Amalgamated Aluminum Company of America inquiring into his awning needs.
At least they cared enough to write.

It was a New York company. You could go anywhere in
The mails. Then it struck him: he didn't have enough
Money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion,
True, but why not mail himself? It was absurdly
Simple. He would ship himself parcel post special
Delivery. The next day Waldo went to the supermarket
To purchase the necessary equipment. He bought
Masking tape, a staple gun and a medium sized
Cardboard box, just right for a person of his build.
He judged that with a minimum of jostling he could

Ride quite comfortably. A few airholes, some water, a
Selection of midnight snacks, and it would probably be
As good as going tourist.

By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set. He was thoroughly
Packed and the post office had agreed to pick him up
At three o'clock. He'd marked the package ""FRAGILE""
And as he sat curled up inside, resting in the foam
Rubber cushioning he'd thoughtfully included, he tried
To picture the look of awe and happiness on Marsha's
Face as she opened the door, saw the package, tipped
The deliverer, and then opened it to see her Waldo
Finally there in person. She would kiss him, and then

Maybe they could see a movie. If he'd only thought of
This before. Suddenly rough hands gripped his package
And he felt himself borne up. He landed with a thud
In a truck and then he was off.

Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair. It
Had been a very rough weekend. She had to remember
Not to drink like that. Bill had been nice about it
Though. After it was over he'd said that he still
Respected her and, after all, it was certainly the way
Of nature and even though no, he didn't love her, he
Did feel an affection for her. And after all, they
Were grown adults. Oh, what Bill could teach Waldo --
But that seemed many years ago. Sheila Klein, her
Very, very best friend walked in through the porch
Screen door into the kitchen. ""Oh God, it's
Absolutely maudlin outside.""
""Ugh, I know what you mean, I feel all icky."" Marsha
Tightened the belt on her cotton robe with the silk
Outer edge. Sheila ran her finger over some salt
Grains on the kitchen table, licked her finger and
Made a face.
""I'm supposed to be taking these salt pills, but,"" she
Wrinkled her nose, ""they make me feel like throwing
Up.""
Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an
Exercise she'd seen on television. ""God, don't even
Talk about that."" She got up from the table and went
To the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and
Blue vitamins. ""Want one? Supposed to be better than
Steak."" And attempted to touch her knees. ""I don't
Think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again."" She gave up
And sat down, this time nearer the small table that
Supported the telephone. ""Maybe Bill'll call,"" she
Said to Sheila's glance.
Sheila nibbled on a cuticle. ""After last night, I
Thought maybe you'd be through with him.""
""I know what you mean. My God, he was like an
Octopus. Hands all over the place."" She gestured,
Raising her arms upward in defense. ""The thing is
After a while, you get tired of fighting with him, you

Know, and after all he didn't really do anything
Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him, you
Know what I mean."" She started to scratch. Sheila
Was giggling with her hand over her mouth. ""I'll tell
You, I felt the same way, and even after a while,"" she
Bent forward in a whisper, ""I wanted to,"" and now she
Was laughing very loudly.

It was at this point that Mr. Jameson of the Clarence
Darrow Post Office rang the door bell of the large
Stucco colored frame house. When Marsha Bronson

Opened the door, he helped her carry the package in.
He had his yellow and his green slips of paper signed
And left with a fifteen-cent tip that Marsha had
Gotten out of her mothers small beige pocket book in
The den. ""What do you think it is?"" Sheila asked.
Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back. S
He stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in

The middle of the living room. ""I don't know.""

Inside the package Waldo quivered with excitement as
He listened to the muffled voices. Sheila ran her
Fingernail over the masking tape that ran down the

Center of the carton. ""Why don't you look at the
Return address and see who it is from?"" Waldo felt
His heart beating. He could feel the vibrating
Footsteps. It would be soon.

Marsha walked around the carton and read the
Ink-scratched label. ""Ugh, God, it's from Waldo!""
""That schmuck,"" said Sheila. Waldo trembled with
Expectation. ""Well, you might as well open it,"" said
Sheila. Both of them tried to lift the stapled flap.

""Ahh, shit,"" said Marsha groaning. ""He must have
Nailed it shut."" They tugged at the flap again. ""My
God, you need a power drill to get this thing opened.""
They pulled again. ""You can't get a grip!"" They
Both stood still, breathing heavily.
""Why don't you get the scissors,"" said Sheila. Marsha
Ran into the kitchen, but all she could find was a
Little sewing scissor. Then she remembered that her
Father kept a collection of tools in the basement.
She ran downstairs and when she came back, she had a

Large sheet-metal cutter in her hand.
""This is the best I could find."" She was very out of
Breath. ""Here, you do it. I'm gonna die."" She sank
Into a large fluffy couch and exhaled noisily.
Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape
And the end of the cardboard, but the blade was too
Big and there wasn't enough room. ""Godamn this
Thing!"" she said feeling very exasperated. Then,
Smiling, ""I got an idea.""
""What?"" said Marsha.
""Just watch,"" said Sheila touching her finger to her
Head.

Inside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with
Excitement that he could barely breathe. His skin
Felt prickly from the heat and he could feel his heart
Beating in his throat. It would be soon. Sheila
Stood quite upright and walked around to the other
Side of the package. Then she sank down to her knees,
Grasped the cutter by both handles, took a deep breath
And plunged the long blade through the middle of the
Package, through the middle of the masking tape,
Through the cardboard, through the cushioning and
(Thud) right through the center of Waldo Jeffers head,
Which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs
Of red to pulsate gently in the morning sun."

Explorin' my prison until I'm let out

That journey a call me quick
That journey a call my name
That journey a have its way
And have me wonderin' all my days

That journey a call me quick
That journey a call my name
That journey a have its way
Have me wonderin' all my days

Travelin' east and west
On every known highway
South to north carryin' that torch
Until I'm old and gray

Well in the mean time in between
I'm pushin' through this
I said in the main time in between
I'm on my duty

Sometimes I get beat up, sometimes I'm the beater
Sometimes man my feet hurt from walkin' so long
Sometimes I'm defeated, sometimes I get cheated
Sometimes I just need it, 'cause sometimes I'm wrong

So the question's repeated, why even try
When there's rocks in the road, potholes in the lawn
The victory's sweeter when obstacles either
Are side stepped or crushed on the way to the door

So I go on my own, have faith in the road
I can share that control 'cause I'm never alone
I hear the creator speak to me through whispers
On winds the voices of friends and of foes

I listen to omens, the things that he shows me
Shows that he knows me and helps me along
And follow him closely, where he goes mostly
Guidin' my path on this map till I'm gone

That journey a call me quick
That journey a call my name
That journey a have its way
And have me wonderin' all my days

That journey a call me quick
That journey a call my name
That journey a have its way
Have me wonderin' all my days

And when they lay me down
To rest in my earthly grave
And when they lay me down
Navigate that big sky wave

But in the meantime, I got my duty
In the meantime in between time, I got to do this
In the meantime in between time, I'm pushin' through this
In the meantime in between time, I got my duty
I got my, I got my, I got my duty, I got my duty I know

the kiss,judee sill,Already processed,"Love, risin' from the mists
Promise me this and only this
Holy breath touchin' me
Like a wind song
Sweet communion of a kiss

Sun, siftin' thru the grey
Enter in, reach me with a ray
Silently swoopin' down
Just to show me
How to give my heart away

And once a crystal choir
Appeared while I was sleepin' and called my name
And when they came down nearer
Sayin', ""Dyin' is done"",
Then a new song was sung
Until somewhere we breathed as one

Stars, burstin' in the sky
Hear the sad nova's dyin' cry
Shimmerin' memory
Come and hold me
While you show me how to fly

Sun, siftin' thru the grey
Enter in, reach me with a ray
Silently swoopin' down
Just to show me
How to give my heart away

And lately sparklin' hosts
Come fill my dreams descendin' on firey beams
I've seen 'em come clear down
Where our poor bodies lay
Soothe us gently and say,
""Gonna wipe all your tears away""

Love risin' from the mists
Promise me this and only this
Holy breath touchin' me
Like a wind song
Sweet communion of a kiss..."

the letter,kristin hersh,Already processed,"September 29, 1984 Dear so and so
Gather me up because I'm lost
Or I'm back where I started from
I'm crawling on the floor
Rolling on the ground
I might cry I won't go home

So here's the story
I am turning up in circles
And I'm spinning on my knuckles
Don't forget that there are circles left undone
And very close to me
Forgive me Comfort me

I'm crawling on the floor Rolling on the ground
There's a blanket wrapped around my head
I'm moving in a line that's shaped like this
I'm holding in my breath I have a room

Can you tell if I am lying
Don't forget that I'm living inside
The space where walls and floor meet
There's a box inside my chest
An animal stuffed with my frustration
Can you hear me?

Don't forget that I'm alone when you're away
You make me act like other people do
Forgive me Comfort me You comfort me
You make me die I'm gonna cry I won't go home

Don't kill the god of sadness
Just don't let her get you down
See that man inside that book I read
Can't handle his own head
So what the hell am I supposed to do?
I'd like to know how he died

My hands are shaking
Don't you love me anymore
I only need a person, keep my shoulders
Stand around lie down
Move your hand above the floor

Gather me up because I'm lost
Or I'm back where I started from
I'm crawling on the floor
Rolling on the ground
I'm gonna cry You look for me
Love Kristin, P.S. keep them coming"

Press the envelope
With my scent

In my handwriting
The curve Of my g?
The longing

Oh

Who is left that
Writes these days?

We'll be different
Take the cap
Off your pen
Wet the envelope
Lick and lick it

Oh

I need you
The time is running out
Oh baby
Can't you hear me call?

Your blue eyes
On my words

the light,mirah,Already processed,"What's the use of holding out
A work sore hand to catch some rain
It turns up empty, all is dry
And all you ever wanted was some rain
Was some rain

If heaven is the future
Why is it that that you refuse to go
There now with all you have
You really should do more than just complain
Just complain

Such a rotten taste
Is left when you don't think to say that
It's just such a sorry waste
To take the easy way out of the pain
Of the pain

When the end shines from the deep
And all the hate and all the hell that history has released
Would tremble before your valor if you'd
Just get down on your knees
And promise to all your children true
That you will live in peace

Where's the light to shine on me
Oh, send me something, send me please
Cleanse my body, close my eyes
I'm naked and prepared to die
In the starry atmosphere
When all the questions disappear
And pressure with a salty taste
Exalts the tears that soak your face"

Beating out of my chest

Filling up my love soaked lungs
Such a beautiful mess
Intertwined and overrun

Nothing better than this
Ooh, and then the storm can come
You feel just like the sun
Just like the sun

And hear you say, ""We'll be alright""
I'm gonna trust you, babe
I'm gonna look in your eyes
And hear you say, ""We'll be alright""
I'll follow you into the light

Never mind what I knew
Nothing seems to matter now
Ooh, who I was without you
I can do without

No one knows where it ends
How it may come tumbling down
But I'm here with you now
I'm with you now

And hear you say, ""We'll be alright""
I'm gonna trust you, babe
I'm gonna look in your eyes
And hear you say, ""We'll be alright""
I'll follow you into the light

Let the world come rushing
Come down hard, come crushing
All I need is right here beside me
And all the love I'm swearing
Take my love and wear it
Over your shoulders

I'm gonna trust you, babe

I'm not awake there's no alarm
The hills aflame behind me
As the ash seeps through my window
My mother's voice spills out of me like vinegar
Seems I just can't stop
My fight a burning beacon
Dare I let it shine this bright

If you could take my youth
And hold it in your hand
Then you'd understand
It falls through it's just sand
No sense in holding on
The current's much too strong
Extinguish all those silly dreams

**Did you turn out the light?
You wonder through the day
Did you turn out the light?

I used to be consumed for hours
Without consequence
Burning at both ends
With blasphemous indifference
Yes just like you
I was just like you

If you could take my youth
And hold it in you hand
Then you'd understand
It falls through it's just sand
No sense in holding

the long way home,mary chapin carpenter,Already processed,"You could be this man, he's got it all worked out
To the nth degree, no fears, no doubts
He'll retire at 30 to his big-ass house next to the putting green
He's got a picture in his head of the perfect wife
Their perfect children, their perfect life
Nothing wrong with that, coming home each night to his cul-de-sac of dreams

Funny now how it all went by so fast
One day, he's looking over his shoulder at the past
When everybody had to go, had to be, had to get somewhere
How did he forget about what got him there

Now you could be this woman, she's the CEO
She's got her power suits and her IPO's
She punched a hole in the ceiling years ago, and she hasn't pulled back since
Now there's a gardener for the flowers, a cook for the meals
A maid for the laundry, an accountant for the bills
A walker for the dog and a trainer when she feels the need to lose an inch

Funny now how it all went by so fast
One day, she's looking over her shoulder at the past
When everybody had to go, had to be, had to get somewhere
Somehow she forgot about what got her there

Accidents and inspiration lead you to your destination

Or you could be the one who takes the long way home
Roll down your window, turn off your phone
See your life as a gift from the great unknown
And your task is to receive it

Tell your kid a story, hold your lover tight
Make a joyful noise, swim naked at night
Read a poem a day, call in well sometimes and
Laugh when they believe it

Funny now how it all goes by so fast
One day, I'm looking over my shoulder at the past
Now everybody's got to go, got to be, got to get somewhere
Baby, don't forget about
You really shouldn't forget about
Baby, don't forget about what got you there

I think it's what got you there
Yeah, it's really what got you there
You know what got you there

the moon,the microphones,Already processed,"I drove up to the city at night and found the place where you grew up and then where you stayed
And then we walked around and stayed up late under city lights
And I spent the night next to you in the house where you grew up
Next to you I miraculously woke up
In your parents' house I lied in bed with you

I went out to feel alone there
I went back to wipe it clean
I took the lights and radio towers out of my dreams

And we went all the way up to the small town where I'm from
With foggy air and the wind and the mountain tops
And we clung to rocks, and we looked off
You held my hand, you almost got to start feeling me
I finally felt like I was breathing free
And under swaying trees, we fell asleep and had the same dream
The stars were bright, we dream the same every night
On my island home I spent some time with you

I went back to feel alone there
I went back there by myself
And gave up on everything that we'd felt

We found a precious place in the sand, right out in the wind
And we lied under a blanket and heard the furious sound
The roar of waves, the pounding surf, two bodies on the Earth
It was intense just getting to be there next to you
And you were trying to get me then
And I was happy to let you in

I went back and wished I hadn't
I went back and felt regret
I went to the beach and I stared west

And at night when the Sun went down in the town where we live
The empty streets were lit up by reflected light
From a distant sun bouncing off a glowing ball of rock
We just lied on the roof and watched the Moon, the blue light of the Moon
The Moon, the Moon, the blue light of the Moon
We didn't talk and silently we both felt powerful
Like the Moon, my chest was full
Because we both knew we're just floating in the same space over molten rock
And we felt safe and discovered that our skin is soft
There's nothing left except certain death
And that was comforting under the Moon

I went out last night to forget that
I went out and stared it down
But the Moon just stared back at me
And in its light, I saw my two feet on the ground"

The hammers were quiet
Nailing me to the wall
I've been hanging here

Over my head

Carries us home"

I can be the silence, be the song, be your reason to go on

How far you gonna take this?
This bottle's made to carry your pain
To kill the hate, and cover your shame

This is no way out
Come to me when you need help, come to me, come to me

In the darkest hour, and I will hold you then
I can be the constant, be your rock, be the reason to go on

Take a look at history
Recant some bits of poetry
You'll find the words still ring true
Some things don't change
Some things do

And you're the only one with a broken heart
The only one who's afraid of the dark
The only one in a crowded room
The only one who sees the blue moon

What you wouldn't give right now
To be another face in the crowd

And you're the only one who is all alone
The only one whose love is gone
The only one who has given in
The only one who will give again

And you're the only one with a broken heart
The only one who's afraid of the dark
The only one in a crowded room
The only one who sees the blue moon"

Her head with pounding voices from home
Behind her was a vision, a painful apparition
Of a darker world that no one should know

Somebody's bed will never be warm again
The river will keep this friend
The somebody's bed will never be warm again
No never again

She dived beneath the water's icy skin
Hoping the cold would kill the smell of angry gin
And her eyes grew wider than they'd ever been
Just wishing the numbness to cut deeper with its pins
And as her body lay there she decided to stay there
Till darkness came to pull her away
And beautifully she sank as up river was the bank
Where some bodiless troubles would stay

Somebody's bed will never be warm again

You walk on stage and you're blinded
Losing you way in the night
Sixty thousand people are waiting
So you do a crazy dance in the light
In the morning you're back on the highway
Looking for that pot of gold
You started out so young and strongand eage
Oh well, now you're lonely and you're cold

The road, the road is a killer
It sneaks up at you from behind
It makes you a slave in the long run
It takes your body, soul and your mind

Sometimes I see myself given up for dead

It will make you breakdown and scream

Where did you come from?

I came from the wind, came from the seas/
Came from kings, came from queens/
Provided means to express what's seen/
I'm the hope that will gleam/
When things seem useless/
Futile, fruitless/
I'm hoping you can use this, the truth can be ruthless/
You're launching your attack, then you need some theme music/
Expressing your emotions in sync with the oceanic/
Tide -- believe but gonna grind, don't panic/
I could be frantic or maybe mellow and soothing/
No matter what tempo, with form I'm still moving/
I move Bob Marley and I moved Etta James/
Then they claim when the fire breaks out, I'm to blame/
Same people who raised hell in their youth/
Now they got all types of advice to tell you/
Do what you feel if your actions are real/
Then you shall find glory when the truth is revealed/
Just follow your call and when your visions are done/
Then wander ...

Where did I come from? Well it starts with the drum/
Enemies run once you hear my rhythm, you're done/
You shouldn't have come/
It shouldn't have spun us into bondage/
Forty acres and a mule, another broken promise/
We're working in the fields where you should pay us as farmers/
Make a compromise, well that's the way you Uncle Tom us/
Divide and conquer, on the road we grow stronger/
Every situation you create will make us thoughtful/
Freedom's what we long for/
Our pain and our soul/
All captured by a reel as our story is told/
So our future generations can express and unfold/
In modern societies as we're nearing our goals/
Emcees will be the vessel, as long as they don't aim/
The minds of our youth toward material gains/
If this starts to happen then you'll turn towards the captain/
That's where you'll find me checking in ready for action/
Solar generated, cultivated by the sun/
Just follow your call and when your missions are done/
Then wander ...

Where did you come from?
High in the sky, you're the sun
I've been waiting for someone like you
Where did you come from?

Where did I come from? Sit back and just wonder/
Earth is my element -- lightning, thunder/
Grey skies signify the pain I been through/
You can see it in my eyes unleashed at every venue/
Messages I send you can cut like Tenchu/
Until you recognize your potential I won't let you/
Wander aimless, nameless, carrying the stainless/
Steel concealed, fucking with crime to gain famous/
Low -- wanna race around the world, let's go/
No luggage though -- that anger that you carry let go/
I ran far, way past the prices in Bien Mur/
Through to the Mugabe where eternal sands are/
Gazed at the horizon and the future looked enticing/
So my only choice, lay out my path and keep grinding/
Wiling -- saying fuck the critics, never compromising/
I'll push your eyes in if you're sleeping while I'm verbalizing/
Yes I do this out of love and for the fun/
Just follow your call and when your missions are done/

He's young, but he's daily growing

Father, dear father, you've done me great wrong
You have married me to a boy who is too young
I'm twice twelve and he is but fourteen
He's young, but he's daily growing

Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong
I have married you to a great lord's son
He'll be a man to you when I am dead and gone
He's young, but he's daily growing

Father, dear father, if you see fit
We'll send my love to college for another year yet
I'll tie blue ribbons all around his head
To let the ladies know that he's married

One day I was looking o'er my father's castle wall
I saw all the boys a-playing at the ball
My own true love was the flower of them all
He's young, but he's daily growing

At the age of fourteen, he was a married man
Age of fifteen, the father of a son
Age of sixteen, on his grave the grass was green
Cruel death had put an end to his growing
I'll make my love a shroud, at the hole in so fine

You're looking at the cross, surrounded in it's mystery
With Jesus on the cross in a total misery
Now separate Jesus from the cross, so you can see
The truth about the cross and the cross's history

The cross was created by the Roman government
It's only purpose and use is capital punishment
But Jesus Christ was all about the revolution
While the cross was used as Jesus Christ's execution

See what if Jesus Christ was hung upon a tree
Upon every church wall, that's exactly what you'd see
If Jesus Christ was shot in the head with no respect
We'd all have little gold guns around our neck

If Jesus Christ was killed in electric chair, now get it

God is not down with religion

You gotta look within yourself, not a scripture

Take for instance, Adam and Eve
The first two people on the planet or so you believe
Their first time in heaven kids they had, Cain and Abel
Now let me show you why the story's unstable

According to the story, according to what you believe
There was only Cain, Abel, Adam and Eve
On the whole planet, now use your intellect
And tell me, what did Cain and Abel do for sex?

Upon the whole planet, there was not another
Could it be for sex, they were looking at each other?
Hold up! I thought the church wasn't into that
But wait, still yet, there is another fact

How did the world get populated?

A thousand darker things are born in here

Living in peace live free escape from the beast
Enjoying my breeze my mind at ease pressure released
Watch the mountain bleed water to supply fruits we eat
From the trees in the shadow put my soul to sleep
Visions of eve garden deceased western belief
Snakes breathe through all our unborn seeds

Totally annihilated for ones greed
Things done changed the world turns in high speed

Looking to score a good time
It's not like I planned it
Left empty handed
'Cause I'm still alone in my mind
Now what will it take to feel right
Can I come see you tonight
Is there someone new now
What can I do now
'Cause I need you back by my side

This time I will give you more
I'm more mature
I'll show you
Last time I didn't know
I messed up let her let you go
I need you, don't say no
Laying alone in this room

You'd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve

Instead of promises
'Cause all I see
Is a shattered conscience staring right back at me

I wish I had covered all my tracks completely
'Cause I'm so afraid
Is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just the train

Lift your arms, only heaven knows
Where the danger grows
And it's safe to say
There's a bright light up ahead and help is on the way
Help is on the way

I forget the last time I felt brave
I just recall insecurity
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave
And sorrow swept over me

Depression please cut to the chase
And cut a long story short
Oh please be done
How much longer can this drama afford to run

Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties
And breaks whatever doesn't bend
But sadly then
All my heavy hopes just pull me back down again

I forget the last time I felt brave
I just recall insecurity
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave
And sorrow swept over me

Then I was given grace and love
I was blind but now I can see
'Cause I've found a new hope from above
And courage swept over me

It hurts just to wake up
Whenever you're wearing thin
Alone on the outside
So tired of looking in

The end is uncertain
And I've never been so afraid
But I don't need a telescope to see that there's hope
And that makes me feel brave"

Little by little it fritters away try as you may you can never replace it

As long as you treasure whatever it is, whatever it is could never be

So if we all turn to dust
Better to've loved and lost
Cos everything has a cost

So if you're gonna spend time
Spend it upon me
Spend it up on me
Just give me your time
I don't want your money

I'd crawl then I'd walk then I'd run but then I'd stumble and fall
Somewhere between the love and the lust
I tried my best I was maladjusted
And I'm not saying that I know it all
Maybe I'm a little more self-aware
Still get scared but I've learned to trust it

So when it comes to us
I've weighed up all the odds
I bet that this is love

So if you're gonna spend time
Spend it upon me
Spend it up on me
Just give me your time
Don't take it from me

I know hard it is
Getting it right
At a time like this
So you'd better believe

How right it could be

So if you're gonna spend time

Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy.""

Told me if I spoke truth she'd provide the bail
But if I lied and she found out she'd take me to jail
Kind of harsh but its real and I thank her for that

I guess that's what I might go through
Can't deny what's getting wasted
It's not enough to keep me there
Even though I stumble down
It's all for today

I'm getting nervous and pretentious
A few more things that lead to insanity
Even though it is obsession
I guess I'll pick it up for you

I'm growing tired of little chances
It's not that hard to understand
It's all about reaching out and grab my hand

And when I go away it'll be too late
It seems the thing that I would do
Didn't really mean to hurt you
I just got out from what you think"

Married to heavenly bodies above
And each night I look up
At a bright honeymoon
Because it sure seemed built to last
Even after my honeymoon past
I kept right on at midnight
Like a ghost
To the house it once haunted
And day after day
I'd steal with my true love away
To some hideout we left undisturbed
We could do what we wanted

Saying I love you
She was madly in love or mad at me
There was no in-between
It come on and on
I found I can't make a stand
I'm her hired hand
I have to do harm
One day I got sick
She played me a nasty old trick
Said, ""I need cigarettes""
Walked around the block
Caught a cab
Stayed gone for too long
My love had gotten too strong
Just to try to getting back on my own
I had to go to rehab
All I need is a safe place to bleed
Is this where it's at?
Half of no chance
Steps in a dance
Your life's just a combat
Now I'm the king of the ward
Because I'm good and I swallow my sword
Puke it up for the doctor to write
A new prescription
Tranquil as a dove
People that have lost their true love
All seem to fit the same description

Wish I was no one

Buried here next to love on my own.

How would we know
If we don't even
Try...
Well maybe I'm older
Maybe my heart's cold
Or maybe it's yours
Tell me to get over
This chip on my shoulder
That's bringin' me down
Well I got my word and my pride no job an' no credit
Found my one true love but got co-dependant
I got no things I got no image
Got a lot more goals an' not close to finished
I got a dream an' a pipe that's it
A drum machine an' a mic to spit
Got a career that made me cheat on my wife and mistress named life
An' I ain't treatin' her right either
Vice versa got some tight verses
Hope the first of the month some thin' might surface
It just might and it might just not
It's a flip o' the coin I suppose I just gotta

I may be gone... but never out of reach.
Ooh, baby blue.
Ooh...

Why?"
two,the antlers,Already processed,"In the middle of the night I was sleeping sitting up
When a doctor came to tell me, ""Enough is enough""
He brought me out into the hall (I could have sworn it was haunted)
And told me something that I didn't know that I wanted to hear
That there was nothing that I could do to save you
The choir's going to sing, and this thing is going to kill you
Something in my throat made my next words shake
And something in the wires made the lightbulbs break
There was glass inside my feet and raining down from the ceiling
It opened up the scars that had just finished healing
It tore apart the canyon running down your femur
(I thought that it was beautiful, it made me a believer)
And as it opened I could hear you howling from your room
But I hid out in the hall until the hurricane blew
When I reappeared and tried to give you something for the pain
You came to hating me again and just sang your refrain
You had a new dream, it was more like a nightmare
You were just a little kid, and they cut your hair
Then they stuck you in machines, you came so close to dying
They should have listened, they thought that you were lying
Daddy was an asshole, he fucked you up
Built the gears in your head, now he greases them up
And no one paid attention when you just stopped eating
""Eighty-seven pounds!"" and this all bears repeating
Tell me when you think that we became so unhappy
Wearing silver rings with nobody clapping
When we moved here together we were so disappointed
Sleeping out of tune with our dreams disjointed
It killed me to see you getting always rejected
But I didn't mind the things you threw, the phones I deflected
I didn't mind you blaming me for your mistakes
I just held you in the door-frame through all of the earthquakes
But you packed up your clothes in that bag every night
And I would try to grab your ankles (what a pitiful sight)
But after over a year, I stopped trying to stop you
From stomping out that door
Coming back like you always do
Well no one's going to fix it for us, no one can
You say that, ""No one's going to listen, and no one understands""
So there's no open doors and there's no way to get through
There's no other witnesses, just us two
There's two people living in one small room
From your two half-families tearing at you
Two ways to tell the story (no one worries)
Two silver rings on our fingers in a hurry
Two people talking inside your brain
Two people believing that I'm the one to blame
Two different voices coming out of your mouth
While I'm too cold to care and too sick to shout
You had a new dream, it was more like a nightmare
You were just a little kid, and they cut your hair
Then they stuck you in machines, you came so close to dying
They should have listened, they thought that you were lying
Daddy was an asshole, he fucked you up
Built the gears in your head, now he greases them up
And no one paid attention when you just stopped eating
""Eighty-seven pounds!"" and this all bears repeating"

While the rest of the world is asleep
Below the mine shaft roads
It will all unfold

Yo
Aiyyo I'm lost underwater
I see a pink dog with a crystal handle, so I keep swimmin
Amazed that I'm not drownin
Butterflies took control when I arrived, I opened the door
No I knocked first, I'm not on my turf
I seen a ray of lights that resemble live fireworks
Some mermaids with Halle Berry haircuts flashin they tail
Like follow me now, don't be afraid
I'ma show you where all the djinns and spirits pray
If you scared to face this life you shouldn't stay
So I kept on swimmin, grabbed on to her fin to help me out
As we got close I seen the boat all shot up with his anchor out
Then she asked me politely what I'm thinkin about
I said nuttin - she said nuttin leaves nuttin
If you fill me up bet this'll bring that out
I seen rubies, diamonds, smothered under octopus
Jellyfish sharks soar, aquaproof pocketbook
Pearls on the mermaid girls
Gucci belts that they rock for no reason from a different world
Up ahead lies Noah's Ark, but that's waves away
And way to the right, that's one of our bangin spas
She quoted I took notice, Spongebob in the Bentley Coupe
Bangin the Isleys, he slow backed up
Then he passed me swoop, seen his chick eyein me hard
He got vexed and smacked his boo
Took off, continued my travels
Seen a rock from the Titanic
Lookin fat and nah it wasn't damaged
Then I seen somethin real big, sky blue and gold
With whitewalls, behind a large city
That was lost before Christ walked the walk
Upon the waters that's so bright
Everytime we got close the mermaid held on tight
All I heard was ""Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar""
""Bismillah ar-Rahman, ar-Raheem, Allah screamed""
That we heard from afar, everyone selat
And the world's banginest minds got crowded in
With life that I can't explain
They said sir yes I'm glad you came, greeted me with Qu'rans and Torahs
Prayed after that we said amen"

And when I get out for good behavior
I'll be writing love songs

To follow or lead me?

I take a picture of the waves
And then i throw it to the floor,
I say why did i wake?
Here in the world there is nothing more than your absence

Now the sky is turning grey
Now the birds have left the bay
Now time is shrinking and they
Said that the thought of you would fade
Well I don't feel that way.

Kill thyself, the Anti-Christ

Fed into the tomb; innate machinery
Acid tossed to channel their thoughts
And to give them up to our skulls
Lights are all that we got left
Slashing into the human thought
And it's guided by ill-direct - this how I wander into WAR!

Meeting our ends to sharpened lies
A poison will stop seeds in fertile ground
Humiliation in our side brain
As we all deform in the... swarming nascent WAR!
Living, breathing suicide!
Still we stare indifferently, waiting for reality!"

Two teeth make,
Tears in route
Running a groove in your cheek.

When the river dries up
You can determine where a river once was
Just by examining rocks.
Your face never forgets a cry
Like trace remnants of acid in your spine.
The erosion's cries cause
Make whiskers prematurely sprout in men
And in women,
Homogenize complexion,
Diluting pigment,
Till the whole face is washed
With a slight mascara tint.
Your face never forgets a cry
Like trace remnants of acid in your spine."

There's so much stuff in my life no room for me to grow
One day I'm going to break from my life due south down to Mexico
I'm going to burn down my house it's the only way to let it go

Under the waterfall

Under the waterfall it's cool and cold and clear

Run your hands 'cross the flanks of a horse
Feel the pulse of blood the heat and the force
It's an antidote to a life spent on the beat
The beat of concrete
The beat of machines
Of mobile phones and plasma screens
How much junk in my life do I really need

Under the waterfall
Under the waterfall
Under the waterfall it's cool and cold and clear

I'm so cynical
Where I need to play
I'm so cynical find another way
I'm so cynical I can't change

Three drops can make a spray.
Four drops get carried away

What will you let it do to you?

When I'm losing it, I like your style

Or will it cover you?
And when you taste it, will you embrace it?
What will you let it do to you?

Come on, baby, drive me out of mind
Mind if I come home along with you
And see what you do
This is crazy
And nothing more I want to see
The sea is not the safest place to sit
And be so spacy
Scary things across the water
You'd never know
Till they have their way with you
You won't catch me dip in the water
However much I want to play with you
Don't stay in long
No one's that strong enough not to crumble
Whenever the water wants you
Don't be so crazed
I'm just tryin' to save you from losing everything you've got

Pull out now or you will find all you strive for

I carry the weight of the world as the past is unfurled
But I won't stop to wonder
Going through this life on my own made me cold as a stone
I'm a ship going under
And I'd tell you this 
But I don't know how
And I'm caving in
And I'm falling out
And I can't resist
And I can't rebound
With the weight of the world as the world falls down
Falls down
Falls down
And I'd tell you this
But I don't know how
And I'm caving in
And I'm falling out
And I can't resist
And I can't rebound
With the weight of the world as the world falls down
(Feel the weight of the world as it's pushing me down) Falls down
(Feel the weight of the world as it's falling apart) Falls down
(Feel the weight of the world as it's pushing me down) Falls down
(Feel the weight of the world as it's falling apart)
This pain I think about it everyday
It tells me I'm never gonna get away
I know it's over
But I can't escape memories and how to face another day

You've got to be a bitch!""

All the things I held in my fist
If I don't let go, I don't exist
They've become the things that define me
How I look and the things to buy me
That's not important anymore

Light as a feather, I'm carefree

werewolf,cocorosie,Already processed,"In a dream I was a werewolf
My soul was filled with crystal light
Lavender ribbons of rain sang
Ridding my heart of mortal fight, of mortal fight

Broken sundown, fatherless showdown
Gun hip, swollen lip, bottle sip, yeah I suck dick
Loose grip on gravity falls
Sky blinding, crumbling walls

Never sweep away my memories of
Children's things, a young mother's love, before the
Yearning song of flesh on flesh
Young hearts burst, open wounds, bleed fresh

A young brother, skinny and tall my
Older walks oceanward and somber, slumber, sleeping
Flowers in the water
But I'm just his daughter

Walking down an icy grave
Leading to my schizophrenic father
Weeping willow won't you wallow louder
Searching for my father's power

I'm a shake you off though
Get up on that horse
And ride into the sunset
Look back with no remorse

I'm a shake you off though
Get up on that horse and
Ride into the sunset
Look back with no remorse

I'ma shake you off though
Look back (with no remorse)

He's a black magic wielder, some say a witch
Wielded darkness when he was vile and
I raise my arms and I'm her child and
He was the bastard that broke up the marriage

Evil doer doing evil from a baby carriage
And he was born with the same blue eyes
Crystal ships dripping with ice
Diamonds coruscate in the night
Fireworks, electric bright

And now he's got his own two sons
Tries to hide his tears in a world of fun
But loveless bedrooms filled with doom
Bring silent heartache July to June

Swoon over new young heart flame
Mourn the memories later
Laugh now alligator
Laugh now alligator

Oh, In a dream my father came to me (In a dream I was a werewolf)
And made me swear that I'd keep (My soul was filled with crystal light)
What's sacred to me

And if I get the choice (Lavender ribbons of rain sang)
To live in his name (Ridding my heart of mortal fight)
I'll pray my way through the rain
Singing ""Oh, happy day!""

I don't mean to close the door, but
For the record, my heart is sore
You blew through me like bullet holes
Left stains on my sheets and stains on my soul

You left me broke down begging for change
Had to catch a ride with a man who's deranged
He had your hands and my father's face
Another western vampire, different time, same place

I has dreams that brings me sadness
Rain much deeper than a river
Sorrow flow through me
Tiny waves of shivers

Corny movies make me reminisce
They break me down easy
On this generic love shit
First kiss, frog and princess

I'm a shake you off though
Get up on that horse and
Ride into the sunset
Look back with no remorse

I'm a shake you off though
Get up on that horse and
Ride into the sunset
Look back with no remorse

I'm a shake you off though
Get up on that horse and
Ride into the sunset
Look back with no remorse

Its 3am and I'm awake
Imagine the light
Upon her blue transparanet face
True coloured glass
It filters down to warm the street
Faded

I'm the one who leads your mind
See my life in your design
True companion at your side

Gracious and good
When all around is turning bad
Restless and rave
When laid upon suburban grass
Your timing is right
Remove the sad persistent thought
Hold the cause

Well I'm the one who reads your mind
See my life in your design
True companion at your side

I'll give you something
When I'm not around
To make you smile
Outside that wasteland
And if only I can make it through
If you think it then it must be true

I'll be wherever you are
Wherever you are"

Your face glowed in the lights
A face that seemed to call me to my future paradise

I thought our souls touched
I watched you when you sleep
Now have I gone too far?
So come on baby whisper
So come on baby whisper
So come on baby
Now even though you want to scream tonight
Better whisper
I felt the sting after three nights
My gates came crashing in
The walls I so carefully built came tumbling down on me
Your bedroom eyes look so sleepy
I'm falling too fast deeply
I watch you when you sleep
Now have I gone too far?
So come on baby whisper
So come on baby whisper
So come on baby
Now even though you want to scream tonight
Better whisper
So come on baby whisper
So come on baby whisper
So come on baby
Now even though you want to scream tonight

I save my soul from the cold of a heart turned stone
And if it feels too good
I think it's time we better slow it down right now

who am i?,the string cheese incident,Already processed,"Through my senses, I'm reliving childhood memories from my past

But, in an instant it is over, fading quickly from my mind

In the photo with piano, I see a man whose time has gone

I knew him only for a moment, but in his spirit I live on

What I was I am
It all comes 'round again
And who I used to be
Is still a part of me

An early morning, cold December, a family gathered all around

Taken back what I was given, open grave site, frozen ground

I see my hands, they are my father's, time has worn my fingers thin

Humor, laughter, ever after, my heart still remembers him

What I was I am
It all comes 'round again
Who he used to be
Is still a part of me

All the moments seldom last
And memories they fade so fast
I turn away and life has passed

These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tears...

This is the fear
This is the dread

And these are the years that we have spent

Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'
Duce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar""
I said ""I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel she said ""You're the king""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing

Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said ""Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing""

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please

Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

Wild thing

Please baby baby please

Wild thing

Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said ""Tone let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing""
Say what
Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista baby
Wild thing"

For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world

And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was great, all was great, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell, I was going through
And had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?

Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright mike, if your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we working, premature, imature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world

Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, cause she know
Where we at nigga? We on top of the world

Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages
That could pay the whole city's fucking mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot porn from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No, faggot, it's sold out
(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me
You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)
But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach ""Fuck age, live dreams and have fun""
(Here's some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero and they fear it
You hear it when that little fuckas reciting my lyrics, yeah I'm rebel nigga
Cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building"

As for being patient, with fate and all, it's getting old.

I'm calling all my oldest friends,
Saying ""sorry for this mess we're in,""
And I'm waiting, waiting
For the Sun to come and melt this snow,
Wash away the pain, and give me back control, control.
An angel got his wings,
And we'll hold our heads up knowing that he's fine.
We'd all be lucky to have a love like that in a lifetime.
Should we still set his plate?
Should we still save his chair?
Should we still buy him gifts?
And if we don't, did we not care?
It makes you think about the life you've led,
Shit you've done, things you've said.
And it's grounding, grounding.
I've been feeling three feet tall this month,
Hardly indestructible.
But the snow melts, and the rhythm still goes on.
An angel got his wings,
And we'll hold our heads up knowing that he's fine.
We'd all be lucky to have a love like that in a lifetime.
Friends stay side by side,
In life and death you've always stole my heart,
You'll always mean so much to me, it's hard to believe this
These nights in vans,
These nights in bars,
Don't mean a thing with empty hearts, with empty hearts.
An angel got his wings,
And we'll hold our heads up knowing that he's fine.
We'd all be lucky to have a love like that in a lifetime.
Friends stay side by side,

And I have conjured you

And all my charms and all my accidents
Are all just instruments

How could I haunt you, keep you close
When you can see my seams, the fraying of my dress?
I am defenseless
Yes, I am a carnival
A house of mirrors
And I will con you
And all my tricks and all my magic
Will keep you dizzy

I only want to be ... with you

We've come so far in so little time
That sometimes I wonder if this is meant to be
Sometimes you are so very kind

With you it stretched to the sun

How is gone?

But love's so hard to hold!
'Cause I wouldn't watch you go and leave all that we know

As I fell through your arms

Thoughts of happiness
Only when you reminisce
Cause now that things are bad
You think of what you could've had

Think of the years they spent
With no money for the rent

But somehow you stayed the same

Your best came back and you got burned

As she burns me, I am screaming loud for more

She blacked it out and then she ripped it up
And hid herself in a paper bag

You seem to be happy and so in love

Waiting for Arthur to come through her window

Here I am, my love

But nobody came and the mist fell down
Her friends transformed into cane toads
Sitting in a room knowing all's a gas
And Arthur was replaced by a spacecraft

Then step inside
And you'll be alright

She stood so still, so beautiful, how could I ever forget?

Now every day feels the same, you look for someone to blame
You've lost all purpose and gain, don't give it all away
They say the world is confused, twisted, blind and abused
But we're taking the strain, don't give it all away

Back when the days passed by so slow
And now we'll never know

Can we go back to those days
When everything was simple then?
And nothing could ever change
Can we go back to those days?

I wish I could remain
Back in Yesterday!

They seem like scenes from a different life
We didn't notice as the days went passed
We knew it couldn't last
But looking back I wouldn't change a thing
The memories shared they'll always stay with me

But what attracted you to me
Was so unexpected
But it was waiting all the time
And it never crossed my mind
Until you opened up my eyes
Now all I think about is

In my life
In my dreams
In my heart I know it's true
That I belong with you
Because of you in my world
In my arms
I have everything and now
I can't imagine what I'd do
I can't imagine what I'd do
Without you
Without you

In my life
In my dreams
In my heart I know it's true
That I belong with you
Because of you in my world
In my arms
I have everything and now

The colors of the morning are inside your eyes
The world awakens in the light of the day
I look up to the sky and say you're beautiful

I see your power in the moonlit night
Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright
We are amazed in the light of the stars
It's all proclaiming who you are, you're beautiful

You're beautiful

I see you there hanging on a tree
You bled and then you died
And then you rose again for me
Now you are sitting on your heavenly throne
Soon we will be coming home, you're beautiful

You're beautiful

We're singing loud
When we arrive at eternity's shore
Where death is just a memory and tears are no more
We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring
Your bride will come together
And we'll sing you're beautiful

You're beautiful

I see your face, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, you're beautiful

Coming back, coming back

You come out and say the word
Quick how all the tables turned
Hate that there's a space to fill
Always have and always will
I'm there when your fingers snap
It's not where we left it at
I can see the love we trapped coming back

Along the barren streets we slide
Poke at any dirt we find
Magnify for us to see
Then dig them up desperately
I would promise all I could

Smile broken, though eyes bright as carnival rides
You wander these streets, punch-drunk on the stars
As the lights are stubbed out in the neighborhood bars

Your voice, thin as smoke, barely exits your mouth
There's blood in your hair and a fire to the south
Your skeleton moves in a waltz with the stairs
And the well of your heart, full of noone who cares

Your words, a white wreath at the cusp of the hill
To mark of the kill, where the blood was spilled
You're the back of the mirror, you're the ghost of the tide
And i would die twice, if you stayed tonight

Now that it's done
Hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderfull life is now you're in the world

Sat on the roof
And i kicked off the moss
Well, some of these verses, well, they
They got me quite cross
But the sun's been kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that
Keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

So, you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
Hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

Just to kiss him
He doesn't doesn't know I pine

So I make whirlpools
And watch him sparkle
And we'll make love make magic

And haven't you heard?
I thought I had first
And he loves me so
We're two in a row
Just look in his eyes
They're blue as the skies
Are picture so pretty
But he is so pretty to me

So I make whirlpools
And watch him sparkle
And we'll make love make magic

But I couldn't tell you
Just tell that it takes you
'Cause words don't make
What I make with you

In common are
Feelings we repress
I find you in the darkness
Where lightness means less

Times when we're
In need of touching
Are when tears
Could get there before
We are walking with pain
When we've seen
People we adore

The things we're
Calling secrets
Are usually the way in
We go to sleep
With the knowledge
That each mind has sins

Times when we are lifted
The fall feels so high
We cry over beauty
It hurts to smile

Your way is mine
My way is your way
Your way is mine"

All these years that I've been searching -- Lost in the shadow of self doubt
Never knowing where to run to -- Trying to figure it all out
Yeah, there were moments but they didn't last -- They say it's my foolish pride
Built a wall around my heart -- Kept it all inside
Then You -- Came to me -- And You -- Set me free
I'm crying out but no one hears me -- Disappears in the wind
Hear these voices inside me -- Echoing the soul within
I was trying to remember -- How it feels when things are right
No hope for the future -- When there's no love in sight
Then You -- Came to me -- And You -- Set me free
We walk this path together -- May our aim stay true
Hold on to the passion -- There's only one way to go
You don't have to force it -- Just let love grow
