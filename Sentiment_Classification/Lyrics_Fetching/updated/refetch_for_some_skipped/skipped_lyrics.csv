Famous Last Words,Peter Hammill,sadness,Already processed,"""If I close my eyes I can pretend
the best is still before me, the worst is at an end.
Time for goodbyes to the audiences that adored me;
they never realised
just how much I came to despise all their eagerness.""

Famous last words,
made in jest, overheard,
is that your best testament?
Or are you coining a phrase
just to see how it plays
when you're at your wits' end.
Famous last words,
to the last you'll self-serve,
what a waste of your breath.

When you close your eyes will you pretend
that nothing bad has happened, that we are still close friends?
So many lies, after all the illusions are shattered
still at all costs you must hide
the emptiness where your true feelings used to reside.

Famous last words,
they're so over-rehearsed â€“
they just sound like pretence.
You'll go out in style,
to the last in denial
of what anything's meant.
Famous last words,
to the last you'll self-serve,
what a waste of all that breath.

(It's a little too late for sorry...
in a race against the clock
now you hit that mental block
time to take that poison cup
now your time is all used up.)"
Don't Cry,Adam Again,sadness,Already processed,"Hey, lo
It's time to go
It's time to say, say goodbye
Don't cry

It's wide and deep
And fast asleep
And now we say, say goodbye
Don't cry

And if you could go,
You would, I know
And if I could stay
Don't cry, hey

And if you could go
You would, I know
And if I could stay
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry"
Shame,OMD,sadness,Already processed,"If there's one thing I know
Things are gonna change
There's gonna be a different ending
Though I'm not one to complain

But there's never been a right time
And we've never been too far
But you're the only single reason I know
That's holding back my heart

Take your kiss from my mouth
Take your heart from my heart
This will never happen again
You know that your promises
Won't last for one day
God knows it's a shame
But it's always the way

And the second time
Just wouldn't be the same
But you're changing with your faces and
You're gonna be lost again
If you're with or without me
I've made up my mind
Well I'm hpoping and praying
But you're running out of time

Take your kiss from my mouth
Take your heart from my heart
this will never happen again
You know that your promises
Won't last for one day
God knows it's a shame
But it's always the way

Take your kiss from my mouth
Take your heart from my heart
This will never happen again
You know that your promises
Won't last for one day
God knows it's a shame
But it's always the way

God know it's a shame
But it's always the way

God know it's a shame
But it's always, it's always the way"
Deliver Me,"Beloved, The",sadness,Already processed,"Deliver me, out of my sadness
Deliver me, from all of the madness
Deliver me, courage to guide me
Deliver me, strength from inside me

All of my life I've been in hiding
Wishing there was someone just like you
Now that you're here
Now that i've found you
I know that you're the one to pull me through

Deliver me, loving and caring
Deliver me, giving and sharing

All of my life i was in hiding
Wishing there was someone just like you
Now that you're here

Touch,Bright Eyes,reflective,Already processed,"Touch, lying on the floor
Wishing this could last
Knowing that it can't
Soon you will leave
And I'll be on the floor
Watching the TV
Trying hard to find
A reason to move
I'm frozen in one place
Staring at the screen
Listening to the rain
Falling on the street
Some days go on too long
To know, no one can hang out tonight
Here, where the carpet's cool and soft
Underneath the clock
I feel my weary heart is put to rest
You gather around your friends
The connection that you feel
When the night has not yet died
You are new
With a promise of a love
You'll probably never find
A touch that you can really feel
The brokenness inside
As hope and less collide
And nothing is real
Love, there's nothing more I want
Than just one night
That's free of doubt and sadness
One night, one night, one night
One night that I can really feel"
Elizabeth,Team Sleep,reflective,Already processed,"If it looks broken
That's just the picture
That's how you know
If it's in focus
Then it's no fun for guys like me

These robots have it wired around here
They'll make slaves of us soon
Canvas the neighborhood

I mean it... watch

Step away
Don't look that close
They could be anywhere
Hid up in the ballast
Down in the basement
Camped out in the bunker
If it should come back
We'll set the tracers
Break it in easy

These robots have it wired around here
These robots have it wired around here
(These robots have it wired around here)
Circuits on babylon
Crackeed up on some lawn
Chasing these scenes
Given a fever
Retless manner
Is it worth your soul?
They might leave tomorrow
They might leave tomorrow
They might leave tomorrow
They might leave tomorrow"
The Preacher,Jamie N Commons,neutral,Already processed,"Up in the north where the cold wind blows
Over the prairie gold
Theres a church bell screaming
On the steeple high
Gather ye children of men

With one hand on the trigger, one hand on the cross
Jesus and his family are two things he's lost

March him to the scaffold and string him up on high
The call came out from the crowd
Theres blood in their eyes and blood in their hearts
For, the blood turning dry on his hands

With one hand on the trigger, one hand on the cross
Jesus and his family are two things he's lost

He cries Oh Lord what have you done
You wont never see heaven or kingdom come
He cries Oh Lord what have you done
You wont never see heaven or kingdom come

Listen to me my wayward flock
He cried with a noose round his neck

I spoke to the lord on the mountain top
His bidding was all I could do
I spoke to the lord on the mountain top
His bidding was all I could do

He cries Oh Lord your works been done
Now show me heaven or kingdom come
He cries Oh Lord your works been done
Now show me heaven or kingdom come

One hand on the trigger, one hand on the cross
Jesus and his family are two things he's lost."
I Want Love (Studio Mix),Akira Yamaoka,neutral,Already processed,"All right, let's do this

One, two, three, (four)

I want a cup that overflows with love
Although it's not enough to fill my heart
I want a barrel full of love
Although I know it's not enough to fill my heart

I want a river full of love
But then I know the holes will still remain
I need an ocean full of love
Although I know the holes will still remain

And this swiss-cheese heart knows
Only kindness can fill its holes
And love can dry my tears
As pain disappears

I need a miracle and not someone's charity
One drop of love from him
And my heart's in ecstasy
The high that he's sending me
Is most likely ending me
I need a miracle and not someone's charity now

Fill up my heart with love
Oh, you'd be amazed at how little I need from him
To feel complete here and now
Stirring within me
Are these feelings I can't ignore
I need a miracle and that's what I'm hoping for

I need a miracle and not someone's charity
One drop of love from him
And my heart's in ecstasy
The high that he's sending me
Is most likely ending me
I need a miracle and not someone's charity now
Oh, baby

Anybody's love but his will never fill this space within me

Now doctor, give me what I need to free my heart from misery"
Desperate,Stanfour,reflective,Already processed,"You're reachin' out
And no one hears you cry
You're freakin' out again
'Cause all your fears remind you

Another dream has come undone
You feel so small and lost
Like you're the only one
You wanna scream
'Cause you're desperate

You want somebody, just anybody
To lay their hands on your soul tonight
You want a reason
To keep believin'
That someday you're gonna see the light

It's 3a.m.
There's no one left to call
And sleep's your only friend
But even sleep can't hide you

From all those tears
And all the pain
And all those years you wasted
Pushing them away
You're goin' down
It's time you face it

You want somebody, just anybody
To lay their hands on your soul tonight
You want a reason
To keep believin'
That someday you're gonna see the light

'Cause you're desperate
Desperate
You're desperate now

You think that things are gonna change
Then you're back to be feelin' strange
What's it take to make you feel alive

Desperate, desparate, desperate
Desperate, desparate

You want somebody, just anybody
To lay their hands on your soul tonight
You want a reason
To keep believin'
That someday you're gonna see the light
You want somebody, just anybody
To lay their hands on your soul tonight
You want a reason
To keep believin'
That someday you're gonna see the light

'Cause you're desperate oh
'Cause you're desperate oh
Tonight
Oh desperate
So desperate
Tonight

Day of the Lords,16 Horsepower,fear,Already processed,"This is the room, the start of it all
No portraits or prizes, only sheets on the walls
I've seen the night filled with blood, sport and pain
And the bodies obtain, the bodies obtained, yeah

Where will it end, where will it end?

These are your friends who goaded you on
That's just humane, that senses are gone

Don't Go,Matthew Sweet,sadness,Already processed,"Don't go, don't let my love drive you away
There is so much I have left to say
Oh don't go, don't bring my darkness to the day
There is so much I have left to say
Oh don't go

There is so much I have left to say
Come back, you know I wrote another song
They keep telling me the past is gone
But it looks like my evil deeds are coming 'round
I can't watch them put you in the ground
Oh don't go

I can't watch them put you in the ground

Don't go, don't make me have to say goodbye
'Cause I need to look you in the eye
Oh don't go
I still need to look you in the eye

I still need to look you in the eye

No don't go"
Deutsch Nepal,Amon DÃ¼Ã¼l II,fear,Already processed,"Ein General stand an meiner Wiege,

S.O.S.,The Helio Sequence,fear,Already processed,"Salt from sweat cuts the land from sea
It separates you and it separates me
An alarm goes off rising from my bed
I was talking to you, you were in my...

Drinking coffee from my cup
I was feeling so down now I'm looking up
Now cars will crash and babies cry
But when you look up we're seeing the same sky
We're seeing the same sky

Got on the morning train
Made my way into the crowd
And all along the way
I was reminded that it's not the same without you

This is an S.O.S.
Can you hear me?

Salt from sweat cuts the land from sea
And it brings me to you and it brings you to me
A radio plays and it's all the same
Like everyday until you...

Another song, another key
And the photograph that you took for me
And the mail came and I got a note
Saying S.O.S., that was all you wrote
That was all you wrote

Got on the morning train
Made my way into the crowd
And all along the way
I was reminded that it's not the same without you

This is an S.O.S.
Can you hear me?"
Familiar,Incubus & DJ Greyboy,fear,Already processed,"Could there be a familiar ring everytime I sing about
Cycle the tears everything in life no doubt I, I
Reiterate till my jaw is offset
But I'll say it again anyway
What you give is what you get

Look at you now, look at you now
You're put in your place, put in your place, oh

Mystery,Phil Wickham,neutral,Already processed,"Here in the quiet, speak to me now
My ears are open to Your gentle, sweet whispering
Break down the door, come inside
Shine down Your bright light

I need a lamp for my feet
Yeah, I need a lamp for my feet

'Cause I wanna hear the thunder of who You are
To be captured inside the wonder of who You are
And I wanna live, I wanna breathe
To search out Your heart and all of Your mysteries

You were the first, and You'll be the end, time cannot hold You down
So, why save a wretch like me?

'Cause no eye has seen, no ear has heard
No heart could fully know all of Your mystery

Now, I wanna hear the thunder of who You are
To be captured inside the wonder of who You are
And I wanna live and I wanna breathe
To search out Your heart and all of Your mysteries

Your glory burns in the stars
Shine down Your light, let it burn in my heart
Bring me to glory, bring me to You
Lord, it's Your heart that I will hold onto

And I wanna hear the thunder of who You are
To be captured inside the wonder of who You are
And I wanna live and I wanna breathe
To search out Your heart and all of Your mysteries

Shine down Your light, let me know who You are

Shine down Your light, let me see You, let me see You"
Vampires,Fastball,neutral,Already processed,"She will bring a little box of moonlight
To light my way on such a very dark night
Dreams so real they grow wild on the vine
Until sundown

When she comes, she comes just like a daydream
And the sun surrenders to the evening
I've waited all day long to be with you, girl

We'll burn like falling stars tonight
And hide like vampires from the daylight
Until sundown

Da-do-do
Da-do-do
Da-do-do

Dreams so real they grow wild on the vine
We'll burn like falling stars tonight
And hide like vampires from the daylight
And our world comes alive at night
And like the stars, we'll shine so bright
As long as you are mine
As long as you are mine
As long as you are mine"
Hangman,Madder Mortem,neutral,Already processed,"I know that death hides in my eyes
And screams from my song
I've left the bright lights
Left for the river without bridges
Slow and silent:
In it's waters I can dream of peace
I know of no hope
Down and into the flood will be my way

And to my hangman I will bow
My scaffold will follow me down
Sing as the soul falls
Over the water your voice lingers
Just be by my side
When the river sweeps my feet away
Though I gave you no hope
And all your love I have repaid with pain

I will go down
Stay with me
My light is all gone
Stay with me"
The Stranger,Tuxedomoon,neutral,Already processed,"We used to be in this together
I miss the years when we were side by side
I hope that you still remember
The fun we had
But all moments pass
I'll take them with me in the future
We have grown apart all for the best
When I see you now there's nothing left
We shared all we could
It's time to let it rest
It's been a long time
Where have you been?
Oh how you've changed
As if you're someone else
I never thought you'd be a stranger
To me, today
Belongs to the past
And I'll take them with me in the future
We have grown apart all for the best
When I see you now there's nothing left
We shared all we could
It's time to let it rest
Before you go
I must admit
I miss this world
Of you and me
But life goes on
Is what they say
So who am I to disagree?
Rest let it rest
And we'll never meet again
Cause even though I miss the past
The future has the upper hand
So we have to move on"
