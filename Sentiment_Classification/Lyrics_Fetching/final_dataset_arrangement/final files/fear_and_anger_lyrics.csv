a ghost story,memphis,a ghost story,memphis,fear,"As kids we used to watch them in the alley come and go
We could see the imprints of their footprints in the snow
They'd turn the corner out of sight
And we'd always let them go
We didn't want to know
I saw one disappear in to the dusk living room
Rain was beating on the sidewalk
But I heard him hum a tune
The melody familiar, but higher than I knew it
I ran up to my bed
And I quickly got into it
Hid my head beneath the covers
Counted up to ten
I looked around the room
And they were back again
Sitting at my bedside, watching over me
Turned the lock upon my door
And swallowed up the key
They stroked my head and whispered
""Now we'll never set you free""
And they never set me free
The years turned into ages
And I could see them still
Sometimes moving like an angel
Sometimes coming for the kill
They made me hide my real face
Quite against my will
I admit it was a thrill
Now everywhere I go
And in everything I do
It's them who's haunting me
And it's me who's haunting you
And I'll follow you until the day
That you're a spirit too
And that's my ghost story"

Okay
Okay, I can tell you don't know
What me and my niggas be on

In your bitch like Finding Nemo
Okay, let's get it (Like damn)

We get deady no matter the setting (Go)

Oh, hе want one bitch (Bitch)
This is aura you cannot emit
I done been through some shit, but I will not forget it (Like damn)
Too much bitches I gotta resist
On my personal problems I gotta fix 'em (Go, go)
Circle shrinking like it was the vision
It's still love, but it's love from a distance, bitch (Like damn)
I was doly, just me and my ski (Ski, ski)
Two deep, just me and my G (G)
Bitch, I been drilling since I was sixteen (Like damn)

Told him that a nigga really clean
 hit you with a 

Grrah, and my bitch told me I'm bein' mean
Antisocial, don't wanna be seen
Bitch, everyday I wake up feelin' great
I'm on demon off purple, don't fuck with the green
I see red when I pop me a perky
And you know all that shit you was doin' would hurt me
But fuck it, you still did me dirty
I don't need no  or , I'm sturdy (Yeah, yeah, word to my mother)
Like, I don't think these niggas worthy
She a demon, she offered me 30
So why would I give you my heart if you hurt me (Yeah)

Look out for Cruella de Vil

At first you think Cruella is a devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You come to realize you've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock!

falling down,jehst,falling down,jehst,fear,"Drinking in electric lady land
Conversate with the crazy man
Where the babies sip babycham
And dames babysit Damien
Plagued by the everyday pain of a pantomime palladium
Playin' games, guilt weighing on your cranium
Prayin' on a path of pre-destined devastation
They're dishin out medication in many forms
I meditate on millennium metaphors
A tour-de-force of fornication
A thought-police state dictates to the whores of a sleaze nation
Discreet segregation
Infinite degrees of separation, we celebrate creation
Creating new means of our destruction
De-sensitised to the violence, the carnage is cartoon
It's Televised to your front room
Guns boom, pictures that poison the young
We're highly strung
A slugfest for the scum
But I ain t givin up cause I'm driven by the drum in drunken tongues
I talk up at the sun but I ain t givin up
Nah

Rain clouds breakdown my cardboard wall of sound
And now nobody hears when I'm calling out
It's like they cover their ears
Say my tears are the tears of a clown
Please help me
I'm falling down

My silver tongue spits gold bars
Bring an amber glow to cold hearts
Show love to my close spars
Living their lives so fast
While our foes slow dance with Diablo
Most can't cope with the agro, watchin' the rats grow
Led astray by a modern day pied piper in a lab coat
It's code red, white lines blue movies
And media scapegoats provoke defence
I vent fears with a broken pen
And shed tears for the hopeless
Approaching the future with a clear focus
Frozen below the mushroom clouds
And we're much too loud to be allowed to speak out
Cause the people might freak out
A free man with his hands tied, died buried below the landslide
Rigged by the sidewinders
Wise to the way that the lies are applied as a social science
To those who show signs of defiance
The fire burns
We learn ways to survive as the world turns
Look away from the flames as the fire burns
We learn ways to survive"

i,cacogen,i,cacogen,fear,"Awakened from suspended sleep after eons of desolation
We find ourselves
Staring into the abyss
A marvel of construction built by beings untold
A self sustaining system of propulsion
A symbol of perfection
We cannot comprehend
Delving deep into the depths
A discovery of unthinkable value
Floating through the nothingness colossal it's only description
As past becomes the present
Symmetrical to the point of compulsion
A mammoth creation from the depths of unknown
As our minds grasp spherical distortions
We question the meaning of infinity
Such an inferior existence
As we face perfected evolution
At the height of technology automation beyond understanding
We wait
The shapeless beings start to emerge
As the light infiltrates the towering landscape
A sea of frozen chemical compounds
Faultless towering framework
For what purpose does this planet exist
Is it destruction or self preservation?
The complications of our ability to reason
When faced with perfection we waste away
Rise to the sun
Rise endless one"

Fat from years of sucking hate
Can never scrape the dirt off
Can never shake the other side
It hides in holes behind my eyes"

Offers
Protective trees and feeble barriers
But is too distant
The innocence's round dance
My various eyes are melting

Buckeye,Lamb of God,buckeye,lamb of god,anger,"Turn on all the lights and punch them out
All four burners going, pile it on fire
Metal sparks in the nuclear box
Fist through a window pane
And our broken coffee cups litter the kitchen floor
Smoke rolling across the ceiling
Suck down the bride's champagne
And swallow a few more sleepy ones
Pass the bottle to none and swing from the gate
Speak in the name of suffering as loud as it gets
Knuckled holes in everything spittle
And love fling into a crying eye that runs away
A dead dog in the street nothing brings a slain king back
You'll never know the bittersweet smell
Of leaving this world of your own volition, so jacked up"

Don't believe me? (No) Do it once then stop

Nothing, but who's paying the bills?

It's comin', it's comin'
You wear a gun, the beast till the end, that is
This is the twilight winter
I am ready to be her son
It's now, I will rise to her side!
I don't need the words, I'm beyond

Keep it homie, this is a gangsta party
Bulletproof glass Ferrari
Die sorry, by the hand of vampires and zombies
Fire bombing, suicide army, God's inside me
Ride till I motherfucking die high in Canarsie
Un-focusable, exploding smoking toast to you vultures
Soldiers in hemoglobin, words of evil spoken invoking
Volcanoes evoked, these veterans are very violent
Non Phixion, Jedi Mind Tricks a deadly virus
I could just go live no love, I read Kabbalah on drugs
Gun in my wig, getting my dick sucked
Bitches spitting cum on each others clits for kicks
Cocaine tits, degenerates smothered in shit
Another day in paradise, surrounded by bloodsuckers and parasites
Getting in shoot outs for Amorites
Leave ya block flooded with blood, it's horrifying, I promise
Eat shit, suck, fuck, kill, and die honest

The big bad fearless wolf
I'm the end of the world
Wearing the flesh of fallen angels
I've scanned the reality
I see it, the corruption of flesh
And blood to you all!

Call me the rap Che Guevara, lounging in the black grave's terror
I lace tracks with terror, forever smelling death
Recurring nightmares of burning flesh
Must be the spirit of Koresh that keep me turning in the bed
Troopers hovering, you'll be suffering, crews be bugging
When they rather shoot they brother than abuse the government
Our crews make covenants from writing darkness
When we spark this, the hardest part is when God's is
Dealing with fake artists, I face charges for speaking my piece
Unleash the beast after nine eleven still got beef with police
Street's a warzone we more prone to violence and greed
No voice leaves no choice they trying to silence the seeds
Time is when will you get yours, stop relying on me
I'm firing with speed so before you dying you'll bleed
This is a war call, I warn y'all, stay up, build your health
Or get fucked up, cut up ya wrists and kill yourself

The flesh of fallen angels come to me all!
A secret, living on by the skin of reality
I am the wolf!, 'til the end
I don't need the words, I'm the beyond the words

The street is Vietnam, I'm like Jesus trying to complete a psalm
I believe in Islam, heathens can bleed till they gone
It's on, anyone can get hit
Anyone can get the center of their energy split
My enemies fit to face Palestine
Y'all bitch rappers only got heart on Valentine's
And all of y'all that wanna know how my metal feel
It gets settled in the temple when my Beretta kill
My pen bleeds the ink y'all spill
But y'all still seem to think y'all real
Jedi Mind real put the nine to ya grill
We spit real and y'all run for the hills
I stab you in the back till it weakens the knees
Then smash you with a statue of Jesus that bleeds

I've tasted the devil's green blood
It runs in my veins
I've seen beyond the world
The architecture of blood and bone marrow
Death is coming!
I have tasted the flesh of fallen angels
I am the wolf yes!, I am the wolf!"

But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back onto Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, Mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad (Haha)"

They look for power, or love, or the answers to their biggest questions. I think really what they're looking for is another chance - some way to lead another life where all the mistakes they've made would be erased, and they could just start over. Nothing bad has happened yet, and all their possibilities are still in front of them
Welcome to the real world

Welcome to the real world... where things happen
Real madness, real savages still get to clappin'
You feel me, captain? Dope boys dealin' packages
Stick-up kids practicin', the wait for taxi kids
Where everything is planned out, there's no accidents
Drunk drivers crashin' whips, livin' life hazardous
And nothin' surprises me any more
Young killers strapped up ready for war, you ready, it's on
You read for Born? Ask yourself that
The realest in rap, some cats fearin' the track
Look they shook, know I'm a crook, be stealin' the cash
Full moon, Snowgoon, gutter bar wolfpack
No time to look back, look Jack, the kid never took crap
Catchin' jookz fast, yo Rock where the hooks at
Tell 'em why we crooked cats, okay 10 entertainment

I feel the urgency, tryin to put me under surgery
State of emergency, for the record, y'all don't worry me
Curse God, tell that Devil to come and bury me
Lost one of my mans last week so lately
I've been ridin around in black Jeeps, ready to blast heat
Cut up your body, throw the parts on a trash heap
And laugh about it over hashish, I'm so trashy
You wanna know what Born life about? Come ask me
Show you firsthand, teach you how to clap heat
Shit - maybe I should write me a book
Title the joint ""Born in Each Year: The Life of a Crook""
Don't get it twisted dawg; I ain't as nice as I look
Hand skills like Nate Dogg, nice with the hooks

""This evening I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell, and to share a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen
We face a hostile ideology -- global in scope, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in method. Unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration. To meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle -- with liberty the stake. Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward permanent peace…
Crises there will continue to be. In meeting them, whether foreign or domestic, great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties
But each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs -- balance between the private and the public economy, balance between the cost and hoped for advantages -- balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable; balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual; balance between actions of the moment and the national welfare of the future. Good judgment seeks balance and progress; lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration
The record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their government have, in the main, understood these truths and have responded to them well, in the face of threat and stress
We annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all United States corporations
Now, this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society
In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together
Now… I am to become a private citizen. I am proud to do so. I look forward to it
Thank you, and good night.""

Get found in the ditch, with your son and ya bitch
Cause I'm expected by fame, we proven murderers

Something for the DJ to scratch, you're caught up

Babygrande is the label that pays me
Just any beat ain't gonna amaze me
All to my days be, you grind up
Let me find out yo that we're twins
Maybe there's a equal of space
90 miles seperate Philly from the atmo
Who clam they came, it must be how they Snapple
Or work whole day, make the X go
Everytime I'mma hit you, I just go
I'm a radical, just medical, I'm a terror
Flat bring hot weather, ya get to that?
Anyone deal with that, gon' bust
Three balls in my area, I'm gon' pop
When this world gonna find my whole proton ???
Barried under ??? but it still the kill
Fronting any other ??? was a threat, better yet
They raised up my statue, at least once I'mma catch you
Other times it might be another by the rhyme
If that's the case, man it's going outerspace


I came, to take the world away
Long time anticipated so the world awakes
Strong arm affiliated, watch what you say
To a fifth executioners, East PA
Play game off the chain, that's the least to say
Spit flames off the brain, cause we don't play
Keep my dawgs 'profaso', we don't stray
If the cooking to ya numb heads, we don't lay
Put rocks in this bitch, from NY to Philly
Told the block when it rained, I'd like to keep it filthiest
War, hell is out not even the beast can kill me
Starving artist on the mic, only a feast can fill me
OS reigns supreme, and y'all can hate on it
Your dudes ain't crunk, if you can't stay on it
Your beats still not, if you can't break on it
And the track ain't played unless you put Space on it"

The base from the jukebox was comin' through the floor
And out through the walls
We could still hear the roar of the trains
Was this all the comfort we got for ourselves?
No candles, no waiters, no soft violins
A dirty electric convector plugged into the mains
I had wanted much more for the first night with you
But the Railway Hotel was the best I could do
I knew the Savoy would have suited you well
But the best I could do was the Railway Hotel
Away in the sky were the lights of a jet
Burning in the night like a slow cigarette
The lamp in the street threw a soft silhouette on the wall
And though it was crumbling and run down and bare
A chair, and a sink and an old single bed
The love we began and the things that we said I recall
I had wanted much more for the first night with you

Feel the cold, invicible hands
Touching all over you

Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding
That withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherf***in' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're probably sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
Look so ridiculous now, look so ridiculous now
Look so ridiculous now, make you look so ridiculous now
Now, now, now, now, now, now...

Remembering me, discover and see
All over the world, she's known as a girl
To those who are free, their minds shall be keep
Forgotten as the past, 'cause history will last

God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, there goes gravity
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo!

One shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment

I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My  father must have had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just  wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest  I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da , I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not

Who's the best? It's too close to decide
But some don't work like a broken device
Two years in the game and I'm rolling the dice
I'm bang on point, I be overprecise
I put the polter in geist, the chauffeur in drive
I'm so fly, I'm getting closer to Christ

I do what I does, the truth's in my blood
But the game's so loose and corrupt
Being immune is a must
I'm never affected except when I'm getting arrested
Had P's, but I never invested
But the rest did
Now the whole ends are interested
I've been tested, but they couldn't penetrate my defences

Нежных самцов и самок
Душили их проводами

Горло в дряхлеющей коже
Ружей пластмассовых дула
Шариками по рожам

В гнёздах бетонных клеток
За то, что нас мало осталось

За то, чтоб не стать как они

Наматывая на кулаки
Велосипедов цепи
По десять на одного
Ломали палками кости
Скрипело зубов стекло
От бесконечности злости

И не было нас печальнее
И не было нас грустней
Взрослеющее отчаянье
Горящих в глазах огней
Дрожало каплями ярости
На чёрной длине ресниц
Сжимаясь, не зная жалости
На скрученных шеях птиц
Под яростным солнца пламенем
В небесах голубых отражаясь
С облаками на ветра знамени
Старели дети сражаясь
За данные им обещания
За вечность любви полной
За невозможность секунд расставания
И за котят в коробке картонной

In her Kiki de Montparnasse

Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did?

But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get a hot rush feeling on your lips
It's me taking over you, throwing you a curveball
Reminding you of our true romance and
Just like the first time you learned to dance and
I showed you all those moves she can't do

Toucher ce vide béant attise ma fascination,Celeste,toucher ce vide béant attise ma fascination,celeste,anger,"Le sourire béat
Tu flânes la jupe au vent
Les oscillations de tes courbes ont pris du temps
Mais attends tu sais
La roue tourne un jour ou l'autre
On parlera de toi comme d'un boudin et rien d'autre
Un tas vicié de cérébré
Incapable
Bonne pour l'étable
Cheveux au vent
Insouciante et sans regard
On t'a levé au firmament des faire-valoir
Toujours encline à revoir les finitions
Toucher ce vide béant attise ma fascination

Je passe à table les jours de rable
Envoûtée

Down a Stair Backward,Oxbow,down a stair backward,oxbow,anger,"Oh, Jesus...
He had nothing to do with this really
Even less than some would like to think

Up around the third floor back
And back up in the fucking ink
The pulse goes slow, the lights glow low
And I stagger in the stairwell stinking
Coffin style and styling
No man is an island?
Like hell, I was thinking
Chair, stair, the table, and the food
It's picture postcard perfect
And it cloys just like castor oil
Jesus, Jesus
Had nothing to do with this really
Even more than some would like to think‎
Up around my, my bitter floor flat
And crooked
Right back into the ink
And the pulse goes slow
And the lights glow lower
And I stagger in the stairwell stinking

No man is an island?
Like hell, I was thinking
The stairs
The chairs
The tables and the food
The pulse goes slow
The lights glow lower

It's picture

And it cloys just like castor oil

And I stagger in the stairwell
And the pulse goes slow

The Sad Witch,Hefner,the sad witch,hefner,anger,"You wouldn't believe in my new belle she flits and weaves a curious spell
And under my skin there's a place where she resides
Finding a release in prayers and psalms I will obey her articulate commands
She is just a coquette and how I wish I could forget
Breathing new life in to the sad witch and she promised me three wishes, my only wish is she should remain here
A poisonous saint with a brittle, crippled frame and she fooled me with her motherly gestures, my only guess is she's misguided
The sins, the sins the heavenly limbs that greet below the red, red lights
Hold no sway with me now she's my intended
The jewels around her neck retain a curious sheen, God is in my heart and tearing at the seams
Her atheist tracts are certainly persuading
Breathing new life in to the sad witch and she promised me three wishes and all I wish is she should remain here
A poisonous saint with a brittle, crippled frame and she fooled me with her motherly gestures, my only guess is she's misguided
Breathing new life in to the sad witch and she promised me three wishes, my only wish is she should remain here
A poisonous saint with a brittle, crippled frame and she fooled me with her motherly gestures, my only guess is she should remain here
And I don't know, and I don't want to know, if she floats or drowns, if she floats or drowns
And I don't know, if she floats or drowns, if she floats or drowns, drowns, drowns, drowns, drowns, drowns, drowns...
I'm breathing new life in to the sad witch, and only my sad witch, wants to know
I'm breathing new life in to the sad witch, and only my sad witch, wants to know"

Everybody's a killer, wow, we buggin' out
Since '86 showin' the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album comin' out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and nasty kids (Go 'head)
What their definition of ""Classic"" is
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubtin' the truth, I'm off the meters
Everybody cosignin', even non-believers
Since I came in the door, became one of y'alls leaders
In a fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers

What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters, it took two, like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place
The beat's slow, 'til you listen to my pace
‘Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident

Three times, fo' times, then a couple of mo' times
Please, you're Amateur Night, it's Showtime
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories
To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like, your chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it, the car ain't important
In the streets I'm in, it's just iron
Cops keep firin' in my environment
Leavin' you slumped, then they drive home
Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they toast up on
I like to see them fall, guilty for doin' wrong

Why? I don't need 'em, I got your respect!
KRS-One, twenty-years I rock
I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock
This hip-hop, and we's a nation
Don't you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station?
Instead of broadcastin' how we smoke them trees
On the radio we need to hear more local emcees
Where you at? C'mon, where you at?
This is the difference between emceein' and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal
Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people

Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!
To the Rapmobile—let's go!

Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show
His name is (Marshall!)
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)

You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (Back)
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn!
 Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear, fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (
Hell yeah!

Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers, Dre, holy bat syllables!
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People, when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!

Now let's get down to business

It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a ""hell…""? (Hell yeah!)

Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?

(Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away
Until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night, everyone!
Thank you for coming! Your host for the evening (Marshall!)

Pledge Of Allegiance,Jello Biafra,pledge of allegiance,jello biafra,anger,"I don't know if you've been following the Saddam Hussein of the United States, George Bush but, like Adolph Hitler, one of the first things he did to whip people up into a blind frenzy of ugly nationalism is make a real big stink about desecration of the national deity —excuse me— flag in almost identical language to Hitler.
Every day in school in America I had to rise and pledge allegiance to the flag even as the Vietnam war was going on across the street at the University of Colorado. And I was held over all afternoon in third grade to write over and over again:
I will not laugh during flag pledge
I will not laugh during flag pledge
I haven't forgotten either.
I pledge defiance to the flag of the united snakes of captivity
And to the Republic for which it stands
I dip it in kerosene and stick it up the ass of you-know-who
And light it!
One nation under God - or else
One nation under psychopathic Pentagon gangsters
Whose idea of national security
Is concentration camps for people who dare to use the drugs
That the CIA brings in and the government supplies themselves.
One nation under Wall St.
If the cops and the government are all crooks
I might as well be one, too.
One nation of sedated tabloid robots
Who actually believe what they see on TV
Even on MTV
And when asked what they think about it
They reply, ""I don't care""
One nation drowning in its own garbage
Indivisible from the fall of Rome
With liberty and justice for all... who can afford it.
Burn, baby, burn!
Burn, baby, burn!
Old glory, the Yankee swastika
Burn, baby, burn.
Burn, baby, burn
Whenever I see you, I see red
Whenever I see you, I see red
If the communist countries can do it, why can't we
Throw the bastards out and try some real democracy?
Run not by rich people, not by military people
Not by sons of senators' sons of senators' sons of senators' sons of senators' sons
Have you noticed how the more they give people their freedom over there
The more they take it away over here
So, now before it's too late to even talk about stuff like this
Be a patriot, a good patriot
The one that cares about their country more than forcing
People to worship the flag
And take the swastika, the Yankee swastika
And let it burn, burn, burn, baby, burn!"

Behind the rope  with my rhyme on cock
Verse shot, first  who had  to pop
My bad weather blew the feathers off a hundred flocks
Seventy-percent goose, thirty duck
Get stuck, if each link in your chain is struck
Can't come in this rhyme cypher with non-snipers
Charge off the juice from the pied pipers
Grew up around B-Boys, DJs, MCs
Through rap, never thinking their ways of TV
It was strictly all about magnificent rhyme clout
The R.E.C. Room, two dollars with the flyer, three without
Now it's wigs pushed back, name's removed
Off the plaque, too wild to reenact
With tax, that's the price to pay, my goal is to

Noose,Alaska,noose,alaska,anger,"Verse 1
I'm a broken
Melody
Marching to the beat
Of my enemies
I have a misconception
Of beauty and perfection
Headed in the direction of
Correction and self-doubt
I have desires of climbing higher
Than I deserve to be
I crave attention, affection
And your acceptance of me
I want nothing but success
I feel my heart in my chest
As it beats
For no one but you
Pre-Chorus
I'm a bird with broken wings
Who's forgotten how to fly
I'm a little girl at heart
Too scared to try
Chorus
So I breathe in the air that surrounds you and I
I get lost in your harmonies and I close my eyes
You fill the hole I've done nothing but avoid
You take my hand and lead me through the noise
Verse 2
I'm a room with all closed doors
And they're all bolted shut
So I rearrange the furniture and it
Stops collecting dust
I paint pictures of beauty queens
On the walls of my mind
I wish and I want
For all that is not mine
Pre-Chorus
Cause I'm a bird with broken wings
Who's forgotten how to fly
I'm a little girl at heart
Too scared to try
Chorus
So I breathe in the air that surrounds you and I
I get lost in your harmonies and I close my eyes
You fill the hole I've done nothing but avoid
You take my hand and lead me through the noise
Pre-Chorus
Now I'm a bird with perfect wings
Cause you've taught me how to fly
I'm all grown up now
And I'm never scared to try
Chorus
Cause I breathed in the air that surrounded you and I
I got lost in our harmonies and I closed my eyes
You filled the hole I've nothing but avoid
You took my hand and led me through the noise"
Blacklist,Alaska,blacklist,alaska,anger,"А, дерьмо в крови будто ставился
Накурил пацана, терь заикается
Пробило лёгкие как будто гаубица
А, не базарь какой те нахуй братка
У тебя есть вес, знаем что всё это вата
Если б строил замок, только в форме зикурата

Почему думают что я зазнался
Пью витамины мне так много кажется
Ты им наврал но их все еще мажет
Мы как солдаты ведь тебя высаживаем
Мы высаживаем тебя
Мне вовсе не тяжело все это делать
Нужны пачки мы заняты делом

Покажи сук которых ты забрал
Ты сейчас с ней ведь пришла твоя очередь
Много базаришь но не делал никогда
Че ты берешь там? это неправда
Ты как пиньята
Но вместо конфет сыпяться мусора
Мне так похуй на то что ты сказал
Видел твой трэп это было нелепо
Че ты можешь сказать мне про улицы
Какой блять кальян курю чтоб быть без лица
Хожу как ящер не выкупишь свэга
Ты сможешь увидеть дебила лишь в зеркале
Думает первый но это просто меф
Увидел тебя но не увидел свэга
Так много базаришь но речь не о кэше
Ты грабишь семью твоя жизнь бесполезна
Я на зеленом мне платят
Слизерин метка на хате
Она стоит на шпагате
Твои понты не прокатят
Всегда был на слайме
Видел как они стекают от лайма
Кручу кислый, липкие пальцы
Больше не верю им верю деньгам

Накурил пацана, терь заикается
Пробило лёгкие как будто гаубица
А, не базарь какой те нахуй братка
У тебя есть вес, знаем что всё это вата
Если б строил замок, только в форме зикурата
Пилл с тгк полутрупу - он увидел врата
А, врубил атак
Водный как блядь
Словил трипак
Не подходи
Бро ты слабак
Курим весь день
Это смоук таг
Вовремя понял
Кто тут еблан
Салют мой бро
Ебём весь трап
Стреляю в грудь
Будто ак
Могу уебать
Хоть и ботан
Я покурил с рецидивистом, он покаялся в грехе
Какой блеклист, какой вайтлист, ты чмо, а чмо гонят везде
В тебе лишь зависть, долбаёб, как будто родился в совке
Я забил раз и забил два и нахуй послал этот день
Ты не понял бро, я посылаю нахуй снова
Инициативный, ну к отказам будь готов а
Сейчас белая полоса, но и не дорога
Будто спортик, треша на лёгкие в 3 подхода
Рэперы базарят я выдаю им всем фол
Какой дизайнерский драг, твой выбор трамадол
Скурил твоего отца, ведь он был косой
Выдаёшь альтернативу, ну красавчик чё"

Pretty Smiles And Shattered Teeth,Soilent Green,pretty smiles and shattered teeth,soilent green,anger,"Later is the late move
Tampered with this fault
Misuse of a weakness born
Transition to repress, leaving me annoyed
Transfer blank mental image to a soul's hallow state
Giving up these weaker plagues
Silencing the the signal to your brain
I think this is coming to and end
Empty feelings of a forgotten revenge
Fatal options will bury one alone
A loved one's empty breath
A friendship buried six feet deep
First time to offer these conflicts
Compassion birthed from frustration
Another emotional conflict
Handling condescending words from a childhood past
Screaming of parents from other rooms
A constant Sunday afternoon affair
Settle for less by losing the day
Vendetta for your rage
Off-balance perception of disgrace
The overbearing of consequences
Over-dramatized deception
Enabling you to achieve a higher step
Social upbringing forcing change
Feeling empty at this bleak moment
Permission for blind eyes to share jaded pain
Exposed to sunken feelings
Learn your temper
Feeling fatigued from the pain
Marks on the neck from a strangling rage
Dealt the bad cards for a means to an end
Years of personal tragedy
Hitting the bottom
Your major option confused
A prisoner of excuse
Thread the needle
You never promised yourself failure
Save your faith
It might be too late at this point
Never turn your back
A rotating cycle that continues to eat itself
Praised heroes you defile once the truth is learned
Idol of human fault
Another flag to burn
Child in the cradle screams over lullabies
Hangover from a night to settle these tears
The cross you bear has lost the final square
Apathy of enemies, walls of unspoken will
Dress up prejudice and call it politics
A coward's anthem for the incompetent
This poetic ring to your contradictions for the deaf and dumb
Words you've tried to use to explain your faults
Modified ignorance in power
The growing demise of ambitions coming to an end
A tragedy in pride
Watch where you step
Cracked shells of rage
This noose to praise
That smile of guilt, backbone of shame
One wish of death
The ways mistakes show their face
Come to change
Breaking faith
It is far more deeper
Only a question seeker
Motivation a mental overload
Somehow within the failure of yourself you managed to ruin the lives of others
Loaded barrel and a taste of gunsmoke
Not sorry anymore that you were the high school joke
Breathing out silence
Your hope regresses
Getting screamed at for hours"
Forgive and Regret,Soilent Green,forgive and regret,soilent green,anger,"So you kissed and now you won't tell
Judge and jury
The noose of adultery
Change this attitude towards the weak
All hope dies, don't say it twice
Unstable event for a razor's kiss
Slice marks that engage this act
Appearance of time
To forget about these wounds
Standing on broken legs
Loaded gun next to the only picture of you
The only one with your face scratched out
Love has no love for itself
Burnt hands from this rope of struggle
Pain of ambition broke these morals
This stage of tolerance with faith in others
A limber state that leaves one open
Whispering mouths join for a final scream
This is when I feel like dying
Uncondition can be felt as it comes to a close
In that hallow part of a stressed head
Reborn disgust from these years that seem lost
In this death of friendship an enemy is born
Open words of humiliation, this moment of silence breached
Altercations of this denial, the last cycle in love
This friendship birthed from addicting means
Growing death of a trusted alliance
Everything loyal into nothing
An apology that got the best of me
The things we do for trust in another
Theories come the end of raging laughter
Linking ideas to this fear of the end
Conceive this day of blood
The new beginning"

These days are keeping me up at night
No way you’re taking me down
Let’s stay awake through the morning light
Let’s leave this town
And you keep me for the lonely days
I swear to god it’s true
I can’t blame you ‘cause I’ve done the same thing
Many times to you
There’s a truth that we cannot deny
‘Cause fate don’t lie, my friend

E finito tutto
E finito tutto lasciando tristezza e peccati indelebili

Grazioso sorriso che si affaccia incerto

Sviste di un tempo

When we were sharing a misery
What devastated all the grounds
The sea of love had spared some time
Oh a lake of sadness is now filling the space
Oh the lake of sadness is now within the stare
With your eyes you forced you way in and invest me
Then followed the hollow of your sweet white lies
Until now you were the one I care about
But the trial of your betrayal has now come
The myth in every dream is always made of silence
And that's the part you couldn't stand
You spoiled the magic, scratched the paint
The masterpiece is full of stains
Oh can't you see you never needed me?
Oh and did you ever only respect me?
With your eyes you forced you way in and invest me
Then followed the hollow of your sweet white lies
Until now you were the one I care about
But the trial of your betrayal has now come"

Seem to gracefully induce a dance and harvest an even ground
Slowly revealing the reason why you must be punished

Innocence faked is a form of art
You've crossed the divine line
And vanity is your crime

Искупался в море и опять лёг поздно спатьЧтобы завтра ничего не делать каждый день опять
У меня нет больше сил
Я смирился с пустотой
Жду, когда меня заметит и возьмёт с собой прибо-ой
О-о-ой, о-о-ой

Наступление ненастья
Обилие слез
Сегодня именно ты объект девичьих грез
Разорви изнутри этих гребаных пезд

Гриппер зиплока открывается вновь
По твоим венам течет возмущенная кровь
Снова приходит состояние ломки
Ты только и делаешь, что смотришь на божьи иконки

Течение времени и твоя жизнь не совокупны
Твоя мать говорит, что ты до сих пор играешь в куклы
Проснись, смысл в жизни иной
Твой мозг разрушается и формируется гной
Твое сознание теряет контроль
Ты человек, не играющий роль

Моя капелла вершит, пока твой рот крепко зашит
Ты ешь, что подают
Боишься, что сильно изобьют
Ты в этих оковах был рожден
За это божьей карой твой отец был награжден
Я был на небесный престол возведен"

5 let si tě denně vodí jak čokla
Kdyby to chtěla, klidně vyskočí z okna
Kde jsou ty časy, kdy jsi používal svůj rozum
Furt s tebou jedná jak kdyby ti bylo 8
Uděláš co bude chtít, ví to
Směju se ti denně, vole, není mi tě líto
Jsi jenom napodobenina frajera
No a co že máš v garáži novýho Cayenna
Koule, koule kámo to ti chybí, hledej
Koule, koule to normální buchty ceněj
Nikdo ti nevěří tu lacinou roli haura
Každej už tě vidí jak zoufalýho klauna
Než změníš přístup, nenechá tě dejchat
Víc než tvůj názor jí zajímá její make-up

A dneska je to navopak (navopak)

Zavolá ti a v sekundě jsi toy, jdeš domů
Koule, koule na co jinýho jsme hrdý
Koule, koule to je to za co tě drží

Možná se cejtíš jak chlap, ale to nejseš

Indra,Ofasia,indra,ofasia,anger,"No, don’t go and say my name (Why not?)
Right after you done kissed her
I knew we’d never be the same (Uh-uh)
Come on, come on, cold winter
We threw us in the air like paper planes
Knowing we’d crash soon after
After all that’s said and done, we’re at that point of no return
Is this what Usher meant when he was singing ""Let it burn"" (Ush-Ush)
Isn’t this the same conversation
Where you didn’t want to wait your turn?
What’s gone is gone, so don’t be calling my phone
With that familiar rеminiscing tone
Leave our past alonе, be a bit rational
Me, I’m no daffodil
(Fragile?) That’s not me, I’m agile
By the time I’m feeling empty, I’ll be senile
Yeah, yeah, I heard you
If I’d need you, I’ve got your number on speed dial
All the things I’ve had to deal with? I’m done with it
Telling me what I love to hear, then doing the polar opposite (It's not like that!)
I’m obstinate, yet only when I’m confident
That there isn’t a better solution than the one I’m proposing
Like I said, if I’d need you, I’m gon’ give you a call
Until then, you don’t have to check up on me at all—I mean it
Yet if you’d need me for real, then I’m down, I mean it

’Cause this is more than just a feeling
So much more than simple sentiments
It runs deep in my veins, yes, it keeps these demons chained
It keeps me sane (It keeps me sane)
I can finally hear myself thinking

Take a load off, stress helps nobody
Take your clothes off, warm waters could end all agony
Hours on end, that raggedy moment
That calamity running, your mentality shunning positivity
Lacking alacrity towards that evening meeting
Cold and unappealing
Knowing my ego’s about to receive the worst beating
Knowing this could be over before we reach that opening
Knowing this could unfold to be this century’s best pairing
Panning that vision off to the stabbing of trust
Or should I say I threw it under the bus?
Played with it till it pops, then wiped it away like pus
Not us, because it’s always ashes to ashes and stardust to stardust
Call this the confession leading to this fall upon us
Erroneous, what I’ve done, you’re disgusted
It’s so fun seeing you act like it ain’t obvious
Fabulous how you’re looking day and night
I’m tired of this, sitting, waiting for that epic fight

’Cause this is more than just a feeling
So much more (So much more), than simple sentiments
It runs deep in my veins, yes, it keeps these demons chained
It keeps me sane
I can finally hear myself thinking

Now you can go ahead and start to count old days
Unless you’re better than your old ways, in which case, you’ve raised yourself
You could be on the road that pays
Then know I’m so proud of ya, living and doing your own thing
It’s all love, I don’t mess with all the hate
Me, I’ve got the herbs, my nerves, they serenade all day, every day

This no gimmick, in fact, it runs deeper than the Pacific
Prolific, stating nothing is ever the end of it
Life is greater than life of the flesh—death, decay
What could have, what may, who made what mistake?
Love is for love’s sake
Music’s for love’s sake
Art is for love’s sake
If anything is at stake? Then life is for love’s sake
Sacrifices for love’s sake
In those eyes, I can see the love fade—that’s okay
’Cause I can’t begin to fathom the true depth of your pain
I’m throwing my deuces up, saying ""This Love Remains"""

Iron melts in sun and steel

Raining blood shall wash the skies

Crushing all false prophets' lies
The crosses start to burn
Into the sun, together as one
We shall rise to take them on
Power of night, lightning strike
Waves of fury rolling on
Truth shall prevail, she will avail
Freedom from chains we are as one
Strike of the sword, dark overlord
Reflecting in electric sun
So the sun shall rise
In skies of Babylon
Vengeance in her eyes
The goddess marches on
Machine of steel, a metal God
The beast it shall return
She, the devils witch
A blood bitch for whom hell's fires burn
She will come with serpents strike
To take back Satan's crown
Demons scream and break the chains
Shaking underground
Into the sun, together as one
We shall rise to take them on
Power of night, lightning strike
Waves of fury rolling on
Truth shall prevail, she will avail
Freedom from chains we are as one
Strike of the sword, dark overlord
Reflecting in electric sun
So the sun shall rise
In skies of Babylon
Vengeance in her eyes
The goddess marches on
So the sun shall rise
In skies of Babylon
Vengeance in her eyes
The goddess marches on
She is the truth that forever shall be
She is the light that will set your soul free
She is the sun setting in a crimson sea

Riding lightning the metal gods cry
Princess of hell, bringing the dawn

無理に笑うことばかり上手くならね
時が経てば忘れられる そんな慰めも
虚しいほど本気だって気付けなかった
どこへ逃げても苦しい思い出ばかり溢れて
無口すぎる優しさが今は罪になる

Und bekomme am Bonzenstrand Sonnenbrand (nice)
Hauttyp karamellfarben
Belstaffjacken mit 'nem Pelzkragen

You Don't Exist,Stupid,you dont exist,stupid,anger,"It’s been a while since I saw that smile
Those hazel-brown eyes, they stay on my mind
Lately I’ve been thinking ‘bout what we could’ve been
We started off as friends, look how it all ended

I even bought the guitar you liked
The chords are playing but it don’t sound right
‘Cause all I hear is your voice in my head
And I can’t forget the words that you said

I can’t get you out of my mind, out of my miiind
I can’t get you out of my head, out of my heaaad
Why do I keep wasting my time
When you’ll never be mine (ohh)
You’ll never be minе

Memories replay likе a song on repeat
Every note reminds me of what we used to be
I try to move on but I’m stuck in the past
Holding on to something that was never meant to last

I even bought the guitar you liked
The chords are playing but it don’t sound right
‘Cause all I hear is your voice in my head
And I can’t forget the words that you said

I can’t get you out of my mind, out of my miiind
I can’t get you out of my head, out of my heaaad
Why do I keep wasting my time
When you’ll never be mine (ohh)
You’ll never be mine

Maybe someday I’ll let you go
But tonight I just need you to know
You’re the rhythm that I can’t replace
Still hear your song in every space

I can’t get you out of my mind, out of my miiind
I can’t get you out of my head, out of my heaaad
Why do I keep wasting my time
When you’ll never be mine (ohh)
You’ll never be mine"

Don't remind me of the good times we had
Learned a lot from us since then
And I never want these feelings to ever come again
You'll never hear me crying
You'll never see my trying
To love you once again
Your love is so past tense
Please don't tell me that you've changed
Don't wanna hear of how you've lost your evil ways
A lot has changed, this time it's me
And I won't go back to feeling helpless and deceived
You'll never hear me crying
You'll never see my trying
To love you once again
Your love is so past tense
You'll never hear me crying
You'll never see my trying
To love you once again
Your love is so past tense

You had me believing that I was the reason that you left
But I won't fall back in love with you again

Hard to believe an end to it

Don't you love to stay here

That's our blood down there
Seems poured from the hands of angels
But trickled into the ground
Leave the warehouse so bare and empty

Will echo in this empty room
And the fear wells in me
But nothing seems big enough to stay
So I am going away
I'm going away

She sang the blues, but I could play the drumset
She made the tune, and everybody loved it
She'd count to three, I wasn't even done yet
She fell asleep when she died at sunset
50 years and not a day of regret
It was here, at the show, that I'd say we first met
You were workin at the bar, I was playin in the band
We were starting in an hour, and the singer couldn't stand
- but you knew all the words to our songs
Every jazz standard, and the ballads all along
And the last answer that we heard was applause
You're a bad dancer for a girl without flaws, but
- we were signed by the end of the concert
Opening for Chet, Tony, and Frank Sinatra
- living the dream, and you winked from behind
And I closed my eyes every time that you cried cause
- it was a gift for the voice of a goddess
Even when I would sit by your bed in the hospice
- and we watched the lonely sun go down
Sayin, ""what's that sound?"" I said, ""baby it's the crowd.""
She sang the blues, but I could play the drumset
She made the tune, and everybody loved it

She sang the blues, but I could play the drumset
She made the tune, and everybody loved it
She'd count to three, I wasn't even done yet
She fell asleep when she died at sunset
- and we played, even at the wedding day
Reunite on the stage, we were old and grey
Went across the continent, traveled on the airwaves
Everybody knew her name, wrote a book, closed the page
- and they had offered her a solo project but
She would never sign, cause I couldn't come with
Though I told her it was fine, I would follow all her steps
But she chose to stay behind, not the god complex
- now the kids reminisce in the photographs
Proud that -- she could take the world with another hand
Holding hers, try to beat the rhythm of her heart
But it wasn't any good, it was the end of the song
She sang the blues, but I could play the drumset
She made the tune, then I would say I loved it
She'd count to three, I wasn't even done yet
She fell asleep when she died at sunset"

Singing songs of the death instinct
In voices yet unheard
Praising nothing but the promise of death on earth
Laughing seas of grinning red, red eyes
All washed ashore and devoured
By hard and unseeing spiders
I commend myself to a death beyond all hope of

Beyond the desire for forgetfulness
Beyond the desire to feel all things at every moment

To kill for the sake of killing

O mortis secretum, ubi finis nervorum?
O funeris algor, ubi sonus somniorum?
The insane wine of the night misled my soul
At the confluence of dream and of pain...
We dance under the closed eyes of paradise
And our eyes tear the insane space
Of the light
Saltemus sub oculis coniventibus paradisi!
The voilence of the winter moon
Spreads a mantle
Of cold icy pain over my petrified landscape
Seized by the freezing frosts
Of the diabolic winter
Our hearts breathe the winds of sadness
Saliamus, saliamus aeterno
Saltemus, saltatum mortis!
Saliamus, saliamus!
But what is in my heart can only be read
By the winds
That gathered my words of pain
The veil of the nigth falls at your feet
Revealing the views of the fiery sky
Kyrie eleison
The gentle sapphirian night wrapped me
In its maternal warmth
And her hair, studded with stars
Had a scent of sensuality
As I lay embraced in her sweet caress
How tender is the nigth
In her amorous delights
Where are the flowers I gave you, my love?
The amaranth, the rose and the lily
Buried within the glacial vault
Of my thoughts
Take from me this fading breath
Enfold me in your veil of darkness
To celebrate the reign of black eternal night
And in the snows, glittering
In the cold fragile moonlight
Appeared the incandescent flowers...
The blood of angels
Said one of our round
""Our blood""
We dance...
...and the blowing of the winds is
Our only music
We dance
Everlasting sleep...
O solitude of death, where is the end of the strings?
O coldness of the grave, where is the sound of dreams?
Let us dance under the closed eyes of Paradise!
Let us dance, let us dance forever
Let us engage in the dance of death!
Let us dance, let us dance!
Lord, have mercy
Birds of Dawn
He bore our pain
He carries our torment
Despised by all
Forever rejected
You are an angel of sorrow
Tainted with sadness
You bear woe and grief"

I Have A Dream,Sabac,i have a dream,sabac,anger,"I have a dream!

Yeah, yeah, yo, yo
I have a dream of reaching Heaven
Me and Malcolm, we’re chatting
About impeaching presidents
And how my album went platinum (Yeah)
I’m asking to pack away all of the struggles inside of me
As a nation will develop and govern our own society
I dream of a time where there’s a cure for AIDS
And no longer will the people be afraid to get laid
Think how great it would be, to stop choosing deception
When intelligent minds replace the nuclear weapons
I’m heading for a dream where the weed will be legal
The homeless will have homes and we can keep feeding the people
I need to see every father keep supporting his kids
Where hip hop entertains and remains informative
I dream the price of gasoline won’t rise no more
So that the innocent people don’t have to die for war
Or put an end to oppression, the fights and constant feuding
Have the people united, rewrite the Constitution
I have a dream

I have a dream
I want to wake up to a revolution
I have a dream
People will rise up, become wiser
I wanna see, people uniting after the fighting
I have a dream, but I gotta wake up now, gotta wake up now

I had a dream my body, mind, and soul was united
My wrongs are all righted, I know how to be happy but fight it
I dream that I might have a little more control of my ticks
And hold a role in some flicks where I was boning a chick
And I could roll up to the Golden Globes laced in newly stolen clothes
And throw the foes while holding both the statue and a microphone
I have a dream that freestyle circles could be more supportive
And stop the spitting of the written that we all get bored of
A dream where people see the green is abundant
I fiend for the hundred but lend it friends that need it, not love it
Uncover the dream where people see a broken heart and go and mend it
Now go and play the part, it ain’t the art of co-dependence
I dream the only time it's drama is when we come up out our mommas
She could promise we’re protected from the bombers
I’mma dream about the day where the fear has been lifted
I shed a tear, grab a beer, and toast to the year of the gifted
I have a dream


I have a dream the media will build the minds of the youth
As opposed to holding us down, we’ll keep finding the truth
We won’t fall for what they showing us, no one will be owning us
Or move towards Utopia and heal all the phobias
I have a dream, all my fans will keep supporting me
Religion won’t be based on man’s organized conformity
It ought to be a time of us gaining our self-identity
Yo, I dream for the power, the fame and wealth of the Kennedys
I enter these days with the intention to change
The death penalty and put lethal injections away
Its invention will save the lives of people addicted
Racism will be evicted, we’ll be equal to kick it
It’s a wicked world but we possess the power to change
The poverty, depression unless it is ours to claim
The game's to believe, a day to become what it means
I found it only right and fair to share some of these dreams
I have a dream!


Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, oooooh!
I have a dream, I have a dream, I have a dream
I have a dream, I have a dream
I have a dream, I have a dream, I wanna wake up to, I wanna wake up to
I have a dream, one day will be free!
Wanna wake up to, gotta wake up to!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (wake up), wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Oooh!

I have a dream!"

So Far,Inverse,so far,inverse,anger,"Hi everyone, Slapthony Choptano here, the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is the halfway point of the year which is why I figured now I would go over what are my favorite albums of the year so far.
Basically, my 15 most favoritest albums of 2025 up until this point. They are displayed and listed in no particular order, but what you can most definitely guarantee is that all of these records are going to be landing pretty high on my year-end list once we hit December. Every reviеw for each one of thesе albums is linked down below, so you can get more of my thoughts on all of them and hopefully check the ones you haven't heard out.But without any further ado, let's get into it with the mention of the first album in the list here. That would be Tropical Frick Storm's 
Fairyland Codex
. If you are looking for some heavy, noisy, but sometimes catchy and always dark and dystopian art punk with a psychedelic and very discordant flare, you're going to love this album. It is an ugly and horrifying representation of the current state of the world, but also in its deepest cuts reveal some kind of I would say tender and personal and confessional moments, too. In some ways, this really is the band's softest, saddest, and most subtle record to date. And I would actually say the best album they've put out since their debut. So, yeah, really exciting to hear these guys continue to kill it as one of the best Australian bands on the scene today.Next, we have McKinley Dixon's 
Magic, Alive!
. I think probably the jazz rap album of the year. One of the best concept albums of the year as well as Dixon explores themes of death and mortality and also memory and resurrection on a series of tracks that feature a full band of instrumentation, funky grooves, killer horns, impassioned and amazing rapping and lyricism, too. Yes, it's a record that is rooted in a lot of pain as well as trauma, but what it strives for something that hopes to see a nicer day ahead of itself. And I'm just like loving that brightness that McKinley brought to this record and just how thoughtful the content on this album is across the board.Also, really enjoying this new Little Simz album, 
Lotus
. Simz really continuing to prove why she is one of the best and most creative rappers out of the UK right now on this project, really hitting the reset button on the songs in more ways than one. Not only in terms of experimenting quite successfully with some new sounds and ideas, but getting quite personal with some I guess examples of betrayal, you could say, in her personal life recently, diving deeply into that and as a result having to go about creating her music and creating her albums with a totally different approach and coming out of it I would say successfully achieving some great things on this new record, passing with flying colors, if you will. But yeah, some amazing tracks on this record, fun cuts as well as really heart-wrenching ones as well. Also, I would nominate the track with Wretch 32 as potentially being a track that has maybe the best feature of 2025 on it. But yeah, there you go. 
Lotus
, Little Simz delivers once again on this one.And next, we have the album 
Soft Spot
 from Honningbarna, a Norwegian punk band that has been around for years apparently, but I am just getting hip to through this album. And it's one of the rowdiest and wildest and most fun noise rock and post hardcore experiences I've had in a long time. Really throwing it back to the days of the Refused, I would say there's a little The Hives mixed in there as well. Just fiery performances, killer vocals, great guitar work. It's just running on all cylinders much of the time. And they actually managed to work some very thoughtful and occasionally anthemic tracks into the mix as well occasionally. But yeah, badass record from them for sure.Moving on from there, Model/Actriz hitting us with their 
Pirouette
 album over here, record that sees the band staying consistent, staying fantastic, continuing to specialize in this very dable and groovy, like no-wave era rock sound, bringing together elements of postpunk and noise rock and goth rock. And it's a sound they pulled off so well on their last record, but some of the weakest moments on that LP were ones that saw the band maybe getting a bit more melodic or trying to experiment with some more subtle approaches. And I would say on this LP here, that is where the band really managed to succeed on the cuts where they're experimenting more with melody, putting together catchier choruses, maybe softening their sound a little bit, making it a touch more approachable, but still maintaining some of those eerie, unnerving, and infectiously groovy vibes that made them so special out of the gate. So really the same Model/Actriz that impressed me with their earliest singles, with their debut album but now just a little bit better, a little more varied.Moving on from there next, we have the new Natalia Lafourcade record, 
Cancionera
. Once again, Natalia hands us one of the best singer songwriter records of the year and, yeah, is kind of sticking to her guns, giving us yet again a bunch of tracks that explore the sounds of Latin folk music, Mexican folk music specifically. this record is a bit less jazz-ccentric than her last 
De todas las flores
. I would say it's not as consistent either, but I am loving the super lush and beautiful arrangements that many of these songs are wrapped in. And one of the things that does make this record special is that apparently these performances were sort of all done live, captured to tape. We're talking one take on these recordings. And as a result, just everything sounds so organic, sounds so live, sounds so in the moment. There's an essence to these performances that you just can't capture in any way. They have such a strong sense of place. you really kind of feel like you're in the room with them as these performances are happening. The band sounds amazing per usual. Natalia's vocals sound amazing per usual. If Natalia is dropping a record, you know it's going to be one of the best albums of the year every time.All right, moving on from there, we have the new Viagra Boys album, 
viagr aboys
. The scuzzy, fuzzy, nasty Swedish postpunk outfit is back and they have really settled into their sound quite nicely on this one. Delivering tracks that, you know, go toe-to-toe with some of their most fun and ridiculous songs up until this point, like ""Dirty Boyz"", for example. But also, the band's kind of experimenting a bit more with some grungy '90s rock aesthetics, too. Lyrically, there's also a kind of a focus on this LP in regards to mental and physical health, kind of a crunchy cultish health-obsessed culture sort of thing. I go over this and many other topics with the band's lead singer in a recent interview where he shed a lot of light on the records creative process and a lot of the thoughts that you know kind of went into his lyrical approach this time around. But yes, another very solid and enjoyable one from Viagra Boys, one of the most consistently entertaining and somewhat satirical rock bands out there right now, just killing it once again.We also have the new album from Infinity Knives and Brian Ennals. 
A City Drowned in God’s Black Tears
 is the title of this one. And this is a very fiery, very in-your-face, very unapologetic experimental hip-hop album that sometimes experiments so far it's not even making hip-hop anymore. Because side-to-side with some of the very brash and entertaining hip-hop cuts that fuse in elements of Latin music and industrial music and pop, you also have legit explorations into very kind of slow, doomy metal riffs, indie folk as well. The closing track on this thing is also like totally crazy to me still. But yeah, really one of the most mindblowingly versatile albums of the year with some of the - I would say, how to put this - unfiltered bars I've heard in 2025. Now I'm not even going to say in 2025 ever put to tape and thrown onto an album.Following this, we have the new Backxwash album, 
Only Dust Remains
. A record that I think you could argue is the Canadian hip-hop artist's most revelatory and also personal and moving project to date with many of the instrumentals on this project kind of drifting away from a lot of the industrial and metal influence sounds that kind of soundtrack every freaking Backxwash album up until this point. And what we get instead are a series of beats that have much softer, much rounder edges. And this makes space for Backxwash to essentially analyze a lot of the pain and trauma and fear and judgment that sort of fueled the negative emotions that built a lot of those records. And we're kind of going through this process of soulsearching and self-understanding and healing and growing as a result of all of that. And it all reaches this very beautiful and self-aware peak at the very end of the album that sees Backxwash growing not just as an artist but as a person too. And for somebody who has been following all of her major album releases up until this point, kind of witnessing that process on this album was pretty moving. And it's a process I think just about any listener could get something out of because I think Backxwash has also created her most accessible project to date on this one, too.Moving toward the end of the list here, I also want to shout out Jane Remover's 
Revengeseekerz
. If I could characterize this album in a few words, it would be artistic brain rot because, man, the beats, the noisy and persistent samples, the autotune, just the insane glitches and details laced throughout all of these tracks that are just almost nonstop throughout the entire record, it's quite overwhelming. It is intensely stimulating, borderline insane. The density, the sonic density and layers of the songs on this record are just absolutely nuts. And yet, fiery and exciting, memorable choruses managed to shine through the chaos pretty much every single time, making for one of the most adventurous and mindblowing pop albums that I hesitate to simply call it a pop record. I mean, I would say pop is maybe the biggest sort of like influence at its baseline, but there's so much more to it than that. Everything but the kitchen sink being thrown into this album into an impressive display of controlled chaos. Really a special record in my opinion that is mindblowing every single time I revisit it.Moving on from there, another very impressive album from this year. We have the new Black Country, New Road record, 
Forever Howlong
. After a pretty significant and surprising lineup change, the band is back with their first full-length studio album since then. And yeah, it's just a wonderful and beautiful display of chamber folk tunes, indie folk tunes with a lot of arrangements, a lot of beautiful instrumentation. Also love hearing the ladies in the band sharing vocal duties on this one, telling different stories, giving different perspectives in each one of their songs. The band is sounding more nuanced and tighter than ever. But yeah, really great collection of songs from the band and it really sounds like they have found their footing once again with a different sound, a different approach after really having to recalibrate in a way that I think just most groups wouldn't make it through.This one from Imperial Triumphant, 
Gold Star
. Excellent LP and personally my favorite project from this New York avanguard metal outfit. The band brings their most visceral and condensed tracks to date on this record are really hitting you with some of the most explosive and catchiest and grooviest fusions of death metal and black metal and just any discordant shade of extreme metal they could possibly conjure up across the board. And around these performances, they deliver some pretty interesting concepts and lyrics around capitalism and the destruction of mankind through greed using the sale of a product such as cigarettes as a kind of an inspiration point. But yeah, really amazing album from these guys with a closing track that features some riff passages that I would say are pretty clearly an interesting little Beatles nod as well. So, you know, if you hear anything from this album, at least give that a listen.We also have Panda Bear, 
Sinister Grift
. Look, despite enjoying a great deal of Animal Collective's music over the years, I've never really been a huge fan of Panda Bear solo stuff. That is until now where this series of kind of trippy playful combinations of vintage vocal pop and garage rock and occasionally reggae kind of floored me with all of its sunny production, all of its catchy choruses, all of its shouty lead vocals, all of its entrancing grooves and loops and echoes. Yeah, I just feel like Noah wrote a very direct and enjoyable set of songs on this one with the exception of, you know, kind of one track that's a little lost in the sauce and a haze of effects. But outside of that, I feel like it's a very beautiful cut and dried set of songs that are snappy, maybe a little Uncle Rock inspired, but I really do think he smashed it on this one, and I think it's a great spring-summer record. One of the most enjoyable casual listens I've had thus far this year.Also been enjoying the new Mac Miller album, 
Balloonerism
. Really had a lot of positive stuff to say about this record in the review. I mean, the full backstory is there as well, but I mean, this is essentially an unearthed Mac Miller album that was crafted around the 
Faces
 mixtape era. It was pretty much shelved. Now, it is seeing the light of day commercially. And what a killer and adventurous set of tracks for Mac Miller. This thing had actually come out around the time that it dropped. This would have been his most adventurous combination of beats yet and could have potentially reset some stuff as well. However, you know, that's not to say that the album couldn't still have that impact today given the very positive reception that it's seen and just again all the great tracks that are hidden in its track list. But yeah, very happy something this good is actually seeing the light of day and blown away once again that, you know, Mac had so much going creatively for himself that we've gotten not just one but two very impressive postumous records from him.All right, and finalizing things, we have the new Deafheaven album, 
Lonely People With Power
, where the band is really kind of going back to their black metal roots on this one. Sometimes with tracks that aren't even really giving us that much of a shoe gaze, screo, or posthardcore pretense like some fans may be used to from their classic 
Sunbather
 record. I mean, for sure there are some tracks that bring that to the forefront. Others that experiment more with some of the spacey, dreamy, indiecentric sounds that some of their most recent records have been toying with, but maybe I wasn't so big on. Somehow though with this record, it finally all comes together and culminates into an excellent LP featuring tracks that dive pretty deeply into some dark themes, really some of the most telling lyricism on any Deafheaven album so far. And it's just inspiring and exciting to hear the band come out with a record that is really about on par with the great and and pretty much at this point classic 
Sunbather
.
All right, that is going to be it for my favorite albums of the year so far. What are some of your favorite albums of the year so far? In the comments, I'm sure you will let me know.

Strawberry fool (strawberry fool)
Losing my taste for you (losing my taste for you)
It's all I can do (it's all I can do)
But it feels good

Running through the streets to find you
I don't know if I will find you
And even if I you disappear
At least I know you'll never be near

Strawberry fool (strawberry fool)
Losing my taste for you (losing my taste for you)
It's all I can do (it's all I can do)
But it feels good
Strawberry fool (strawberry fool)
Losing my taste for you (losing my taste for you)
It's all I can do (it's all I can do)

That's it- right there

Paris Hilton's Closet,Ke$ha,paris hiltons closet,keha,anger,"My best friend Sarah went to Europe for the summer
My brother got kicked out of school, aw bummer
Julie-Anne got laid in the backseat of a Hummer
And got arrested like Mel Gibson
I read in the trades that the *NSYNC boy is..
No way

But I threw up in Paris Hilton's closet
I got drunk and totally lost it
When I woke up the first thing that I thought of was:
''Oh my Kesha, those hot Jimmy Choos''
Hey Paris, did I lose it on that pair too?

Celebutants work in the glamorazzi
Should've told my story to the tabloids, took the money
It takes a lot to get kicked out of those parties
And almost get arrested like Mel Gibson
I don't recall at all, but I got like fifty phone calls
Oh my God, is it true?

But I threw up in Paris Hilton's closet
I got drunk and totally lost it
When I woke up the first thing that I thought of was:
''Oh, no, no Kesha, those hot Gucci shoes (What'd you do?)''
Hey Paris, did I lose it on that pair too?

Oh, of all the stupid things I've done (I've)
I'm the proudest of this bra
But this one's the best

I threw up in Paris Hilton's closet
I got drunk and totally lost it
When I woke up the first thing that I thought of was:
''Oh my Kesha, those hot Jimmy Choos''

''And those Minolos and Pradas and Chloes and your sparkly dresses''
Hey Paris, I saw the same stuff at Target
Hey Paris, what ya' gonna do?
What ya' gonna do, what ya' gonna do?
I totally lost it, la la la, oh, no, boy, I've lost it, la la la

The Mess You Made,KMFDM,the mess you made,kmfdm,anger,"""- police are advising everyone to stay clear of alleys and back streets during nighttime hours- ""
""- and so far, none of the bodies have been recovered -""
""-  behind me, where this vicious assault has left only blood in its aftermath -""
""- and no one knows when or where the Trashman will strike again-""
I'm always following in your wake
I'm always cleaning up the mess you make
I've got my weapons ready, here we go
It will be over before you know
I'm right behind you in the dead of night
Keeping an eye on everything you trade
You put a tag on everything in sight, but you
Pay no attention to the mess you've made
Hear me on this
I will bring you the end of your world
It's a bedtime story they don't tell the rich
You are all on my watchlist and karma —
Well, karma's a bitch
Unseen hands are throwing the dice
Systems crumbling beneath their weight
Remember: everything has got a price
And every soul has an interest rate
Evaluate the sum of your lies
Put on your business smile and corporationalize
What you brought upon others has come back for you
You'll become what you used to despise
Traffickers of lives and traders of fate
Selling your dead lust across the sea
And once you are free, it is all too late
They once paid for you, but now they pay for me

""of the twenty .....not one body has been recovered-""
""...in Queens just after midnight...""
Some blood has been shed, your greed has been fed
As have the imp on your back and the voices in your head
Put your calls on hold and allow me this dance
Reschedule your meetings and cancel your plans
Always tainted, always scarred
Sick of waiting, no holds barred
Judgment fails, and morals fade
Cleaning up the mess you made
Stay where you stand
And get choked by that invisible hand
In this corporate hell that will only compel you
To retcon supply and demand
I'll bring you down on your knees
From the top of the world to despair
I'm the solution, the treatment, and you're the disease
I'll be the end of your line, no doubt — watch out
Beware
""And once again, he has gotten away"""

Won't you please come to Chicago
Show your face
From the bottom to the ocean
To the mountains of the moon
Won't you please come to Chicago
No one else can take your place
We can change the world
Re-arrange the world

It’s dying, and if you believe in freedom

Que lio te digo quieres hacerte mio
Ven y sientate conmigo
Cuentame todos tus motivos
Que cuando la noche se haya ido
En mis brazos vas a haber caido
Imaginar anticipar acariciar
Tus ojos tu boca me vuelven loca loca
Que lio te digo quieres hacerte mio (x2)
No me miras me conoces

Priez encore,Belenos,priez encore,belenos,anger,"Où est donc la lumière
Dans vos sinistres cathédrales?
Il n'y a qu'une triste idole
Reflétant vos désespoirs
Agenouillés sans cesse, vous priez
Attendant vos nombreux miracles
Mais vous écoute t-il vraiment?
Où se cache t-il derrière ces larmes?
Regardez le pendu sur sa croix
N'a t-il pas l'air misérable?
Son sang filant entre ses doigts
Dans son ciel, air irrespirable
Des icônes marquent son histoire
Dieu fait l'homme à son image
Alors vivеz comme lui pauvres âmes dérisoirеs
Dans la douleur les coeurs épris de noir"

Doch darüber bin ich hinaus, ich weiß, mein Herz wird nie mehr heiß

Herz aus Glas wie gut das tut
Nichts tut weh, kaltes Blut
Was er auch fühlt ist mir einerlei
Denn mein Herz bleibt immer frei

Ich gesteh, die erste male taten mir nur schrecklich weh
Ich hab geweint und rief jeden an, jeden Freund
Doch heute Nacht mich kalte liebe erfror

Ja, und aus, ist Schluss, vergessen und vorbei

Ella va y le pregunta a las estrellas
Donde esta mi amor?

Seu aroma deixa de estar nos nossos dias
Rosas, minas, monas, mulheres, companheiras enterradas
Nos Jardins das almas esquecidas
A estranha colheita do feminicídio como se fossem ervas daninhas
Asfixia ao trans, travesti a dor é legítima, quantas plantas mortas por essas fitas?
Visão de revolução é contra a elite racista
Rap de direita merece tiro e facada em fascista
Menos doação pra criança pobre do que animais
Os deveres são plenos, os direitos não iguais
Tomaram suas mentes com Wi-Fi's
Orgulho do gueto lágrimas secas, enquanto chove a mil por hora
Onde ninguém se move, o rico ostenta seu lixo de 5 toneladas
Tomamos em goles de dor a cerveja na quebrada
Compramos ilusão em pit stops pensando em praias
A vida se tornou um eterno retorno ao grande nada
De tudo o que me incomoda, privilégios de todos os lados
Cobrança dá 100% de gás por nada
E se 10 vezes se batizar não muda
Igreja não lapida conduta
A cada escola que faço palestra, é um palco que deixo de ir
É um menino a menos ególatra que deixa de ruir
Riram quando eu disse que o livro pode salvar
Agora reclama nos bares que saí do lugar
Estou preso no copo de alguém, engoli os choros
Comi as lágrimas, não digo amém
Eu e a morte não nos damos bem
Ela me roubava amigos, te amo também
Escrevi essa fita porque assinei o artigo A286
Com o mundo nos ombros sem brincadeira
E o suor escorrendo de tanto carregar
Uma pá de gente que não consegui resgatar
Produtivo, doente, obeso, inconsequente
Maloqueiro, escritor envolvido com os bagulho
De vez em quando alguém me tira da caixa, tira o pó
E me põe no show com outros entulhos
Em outros estados todos se misturam
Em São Paulo é isso mesmo meu querido:
Treta de rua, bairrismo, bombetas e símbolos de fênix
Seu namastê não faz efeito
Somos problema e matamos a solução
Somos o caos porque a ordem nunca foi ostentação
Ferréz e A286 rap de verdade, literatura marginal na fé
Pra fazer comedor de Nutella voltar de marcha ré"

Eleven coffees, Ricki Lake on play
But late at night when I'm feeling blue
I'd sell my ass before I think of you
Seven hours since you closed the door
Started a diet, got a manicure
Erased your number from my telephone
And if you call me, I won't be at home

They say
Why you cry-y-y
For the guy-y-y?
Say goodbye
Run away
Why you cry-y-y
For the guy-y-y?

Because of you boy

Eleven hours on a brand-new day
I'm getting ready to go out and play
It's late at night, I'm caught in a groove
I'll kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue
Seven hours, what you calling for?
A bunch of flowers and I'll slam the door
You're in my face, sorry what's your name?
Takes more than begging to reverse my brain
'Cause

Ooh, boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head
Because I do boy
And it's cool boy
And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy
Such a fool boy

I'm through with it, over it

Not feeling this
Can't deal, I quit
No more, no more
I'm through with it
Not having it, this crazy shit
Not feeling it
Can't deal with it
No more, I quit
No more, no more

Breaking off the bun
A brand-new day has just begun
Just because you made me go ""ooh""
Doesn't mean I'll put up with you
Don't you dare turn back
Can't you see I won't take that?
I ain't crying over you
Better fill your head up like I told you

Why you cry-y-y

Been looking forward to the day where I could shine and
Show the world I’m ready to lead the masses
They follow the latest trends, I’m cashin’ in on the action
It ain’t a thang, I’m doing it in my sleep
They thinkin’ it’s hella easy, but can’t nobody be me
No matter how much they try to study up on my moves
I’m doin’ it for the future, they doin’ it just to schmooze
See ‘em at all the hot spots looking for a way in
Playing my position only bosses have the patience
Got the Luca Brasi rolling with the illest posse
6Fingers hit ‘em hard on the beat, I kill ‘em softly
Fuck a co-sign, I put myself on
Ten consecutive editorials up in Rolling Stone
Did what you could never do, been where you ain’t never been
Out with the old, now let a real fire-spitter in

EyeASage ain’t never been a MRSHMLO
EyeASage never gonna be a MRSHMLO

But I ain’t impressed with that industry repertoire
(Yeah) I got an entourage flyer than your girlfriend
(No) We ain’t in love with your boys or your wingmen
(Yeah) I rock the stage and I kick it with the best of ‘em
You can keep ya soft ass beats for the rest of ‘em

So I got ya ex-girl bump me on her iPhone
(No) I ain’t a dummy but I do like to Go Dumb
And I rep the whole Yay Area where I come from
(Yeah) I got the 40 Water speaking on my qualities
But I never got the sample cleared if you’re asking me
I got the sticky icky and I roll that good doj
Call me EyeASage, 40 tell ‘em what I ain’t though


Love it when the beat drops, 6 is a monsta
Put me on a cereal box and make the kids want it
I got the sugar cane, they got that saccharine
Most of these suckas is too sweet to be battlin’
They be embellishin’, relishin’ on that good life
Falling back on they content, worryin’ bout they punchlines
I be kickin’ the feet up and tell ‘em “ease up”
Givin’ ‘em what they want just enough to get ‘em a taste of
Rather be underestimated, than oversaturated
These other rappers gettin’ wacker the more they music played
I’m gettin’ fresher by the second, I ain’t done yet
I’m comin’ hard and I’m barely gettin’ my feet wet
This is a lesson to the critics in they armchairs
Wondering if what they hear is how I’m out there
Love it or leave it, I’m just gettin’ it in
And you can worry ‘bout it then so let the talkin’ begin"

Esta Noche es Nuestra,Naty Botero,esta noche es nuestra,naty botero,anger,"Letra de ""Esta Noche Es Nuestra"" ft. Joe Arroyo
Desde que anochece hasta que amanece
Jugarás con mi piel
Y yo te voy a mostrar que estoy hirviendo de deseo
Y no me puedo contener

Oye, poquito a poco, mujer
Mis ganas crecen, crecen
Cuando te veo, yo pierdo el aliento
Y toda mi etiqueta se desaparece

Esta noche es nuestra
Para sentirnos vivos
Para bailar y gozar y besarnos, toda la noche entera
Esta noche es nuestra  (esta noche es nuestra)
Contigo se ilumina
Tú, el calor, la pasión, el amor y el sabor que necesita mi vida

Cuando tú te acercas
Siento una tormenta
Vuelan mis sentidos
De forma violenta

Me tiro a tocarte
Y no, no, no es suficiente
Al sentir tus movimientos, tus caderas y tu aliento
Yo, yo no me aguanto mujer

Esta noche es nuestra (esta noche es nuestra)
Para sentirnos vivos (que no se acabe jamás)
Para bailar y gozar y besarnos, toda la noche entera
Esta noche es nuestra (esta noche es nuestra)
Contigo se ilumina
Tú, el calor, la pasión, el amor y el sabor que necesita mi vida

En tus ojos puedo ver
El sol vuelve a brillar (quiere, quiere más, más)
Me gustas tanto, tanto
Que me duele el final (yo no quiero que se acabe nunca más…)
Estas noche todos mis sueños se vuelven realidad
Mañana volverás a llenarme de los besos
Que tatuados en mi piel no voy a poder borrar

Esta noche es nuestra (esta noche es nuestra)
Para sentirnos vivos (que no se acabe jamás)
Para bailar y gozar y besarnos toda la noche entera
(Tú, el amor, el sabor de mi vida)
Esta noche es nuestra (esta noche es nuestra)
Contigo se ilumina
Tú, el calor, la pasión, el amor y el sabor que necesita mi vida"

Κι αν καώ κι αν φαρμάκι πιώ
Γελάω ξανά
Κι ασ κλάψω μετά
Η αγάπη θα' ναι πάντα σαν ευχή
Αν κάποιοσ που δει
Τ' αστέρια βροχή
Προλάβει τ' όνειρό του να τουσ πει
Πονάει θεσ δε θεσ
Μα υπάρχουν στιγμέσ
Που πάνω από τα σύννεφα πετάσ
Πόλεμοσ κι ειρήνη εδώ
Τον λογαριασμό
Στησ αγάπησ τα θύματα"
Ouch That Feels Good,Dale Bozzio,ouch that feels good,dale bozzio,anger,"Shoot me a shot of happy
Show me how it feels to make believe
You're in a euphoric state
And I wanna be in it
Let me be the question that you need
Play me like a piano, so sweet
I'll be your love next to life
God, give me one more night 'cause

Ouch, that feels good
Ouch (ouch) that feels good (ouch)

Speak my words before I think them
Make me the choice of your kingdom
Trace my face with your fingertips
Hold me till death, nourish my lips (muah!)
Race me with your witted thoughts
Your charm and smile, pump my heart
Teach me your chromatic scales
Spare me the tears of a blue moon tale

Ouch (ouch) that feels good
I'm telling you
Ouch (ouch) that feels good
Ouch that feels good (ouch)
Ouch (ouch) that feels good
Ouch

(Telling you, telling you, telling you it feels good)
Like a cat in the night
You ran across my bed
Filled my head with
Ummm instead
I know you can and I might
But don't tell me, show me
Night time falls too short
To share my ideas
And that feels so good
It's impossible to react
When if you give, baby
You naturally get back
Drawing my conclusions
And surviving on, umm, illusions
The cat in the night
That ran across my bed
Filled my head
I know you can and I might
But don't tell me, show me
Night time falls too short
I feel good
Ouch that feels good (ouch, ouch)
Ouch that feels good (good, good, ouch)
Ouch, that feels good (good, tellin' you )

A shot was heard, a bitch was shot that day
The hoes were taking over, riding three deep
Lorenzo rims in a black cherry Jeep
The bitch violated, her name was Terri B
Riding the coat tail of the rapper Eazy-E
Now I'm a give you an F 'cause your ass'll stand tall
A funky white bitch with a little bit of ball
Ruthless, that's what you think you are
A hoe is on the beat, so you won't get very far
Talking that shit on a murder you wrote
Bitch try again, that's a motherfucking joke
Wicky-wicky-wack, that's what I said
Now a wacked assed bitch got a nine to her head
Don't lay back, and start to cry
It's a hell of a choice,  to live or die

To live or die, die bitch
To live or die, die bitch
To live or die, die bitch
To live or die, die bitch

I'm a motherfucker, I'll put you through a test
You're another sucker I had to lay to rest
Blood sweat and tears running down your face
I ain't even pull a trigger, now I got a murder case
I'll drop your ass right down to your knees
You're begging like a punk, baby girl, please
Fuck you, yeah, I said it again
I'll kick your ass while I count to ten
The choice is yours, you'd better make it fast
Five more seconds, the nine up your ass
I'm wasting my time 'cause it ain't no fight
Imma fuck you up when we touch the mike
My rap's so strong, like an armored tank
Step back bitch, 'cause you're about to get ganked
H.W.A. is in the place
Kicking funky rhymes all in your face
Murder, murder, is what you preach
You wouldn't kick sand on a motherfucking beach
Your record deal is a mystery to me
You must have give Eric some white pussy
Bitch, you think you're hard, but you're softer than butter
Trying to hang around the Compton brothers
You want to be black, and that's no lie
Bitch, make a choice, to live or die

I don't know where you're from, but it sure ain't the streets
'Cause you're walking around sweet and petite
I'm the baddest, hardest bitch in the world
Check my credentials, they call me baby girl
Taking white bitches out is a hobby of mine
Fuck all that shit, Jaz, pass me the nine
Remember that test, bitch you didn't pass
Now I'm forced to put the nine back in your ass
Put the clip in then I blast you
No, that didn't get past you
Your no rapping ass was bound to fail
Now my motherfucking ass might wind up in jail
I went to court and copπed my plea
I had to murder, she was a wack MC
The judge liked me and gave me a try
'Cause he liked my hit, to live or die

Die bitch
To live or die, die bitch
To live or die, die bitch

The American life
The American life
The American life
Fuck it

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I walk alone I walk alone
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
I walk alone I walk a-
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Till then I walk alone

Every day I wake up and it's Sunday
Whatever's in my eye won't go away
The radio is playing all the usual
What's a Wonderwall anyway

Backbeat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge
And where I walk alone
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you

Read between the lines
What's ----ed up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
I walk alone I walk alone
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I walk alone I walk a-

And all the roads we have to walk along are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a-

Because maybe
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
You're gonna be the one who saves me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
You're gonna be the one who saves me
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Till then I walk alone
Sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (come on!)
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away"

And when he smiled he just looked right through me
He had a manner so pleasing

It's time to rock, uh, that's what it is

And the only way to play is with this promise ring

Sometimes a girl needs to know that shes
Appreciated for all the things she does
With some sorta token of love
Cause without it her young heart won't know

He pulled out a small velvet box
Pink ribbon tied
I'm wondering what's inside
He opened it and then he replied

He said
I promise not to hurt you
I promise not to lie
I promise to befriend you
And defend you with my life
I promise you forever
I promise you today
He said, ""Would you wear my promise ring?""
I said yes

I say it's all right

My pillow screams, too
But so does my kitchen
And water and my shoes and the road
I have a gun in my head
I'm invisible
I can't find the ice
A slug
I'm TV
I hate
A boy was tangled in his bikе forever
A girl was missing two fingers
Gеrri Ann was confused
Mr. Huberty had a gun in his head
So I sit up late in the morning and ask myself again
How do they kill children?
And why do I want to die?
They can no longer move
I can no longer be still

Depends on how long she's been gone

Жизнь жестока (Жестока, жестока, жестока)
Каждый день, выходя на улицы, я вижу это
Я вижу, как реальные парни страдают (Парни страдают)
И я знаю от чего (От чего, от чего)

Я так и знал, все бабы — бляди
Как ты могла, зараза, променять меня на этого козла из параллельного класса?
Ну, да, ведь у него нала навалом на кармане
В столовую не ходит, жрёт только в ресторане
Что такое общественный транспорт он и не знает даже
В школу его возит на тачке шофёр его папаши
И ты на это повелась? А как же наша любовь?
Мои дежурства у подъезда при погоде любой
Как ты могла забыть всё то, что было между нами?
Медляк на школьной дискотеке, поцелуи в спальне
На вечеринке в квартире у твоей подруги Маринки
Там был бы даже секс, если б не пил я столько синьки
А помнишь, когда я подарил тебе свою кассету?
Ты мне сказала, что круче меня музыкантов нету
И после этого ты топчешь мои чувства, гнида?
Всё решено, я ухожу посредством суицида

Я уйду
И ты меня не жди, я не вернусь
Никогда
И все, кто знал меня, жалеют пусть
Будешь знать
Что это значит — разбивать сердца
Я уйду
И ты назад меня не жди, овца

Сегодня предки на работе, день как раз, что нужно
За окном с самого утра хуярит дождь по лужам
Всё вроде бы ништяк, осталось только выбрать способ
Что лучше: бритва, петля, прыжок с крыши или колёса?
Попробую таблетки. Что там в маминой аптечке?
Блин, только Но-шпа, аспирин и ректальные свечки
План «А», по ходу, отпадает, что за ним по списку?
Во, повеситься — охуенное самоубийство
Как только сочиню записку, так повисну сразу
Ну, где же ты, моя муза? Подкинь первую фразу
А, хрен с ним, так и напишу: «Прошу винить Наташу»
На этом и закончу, точку не поставлю даже
Короче, где бы мне попрочнее найти верёвку?
Пойду-ка посмотрю, что там в папиной лежит кладовке
Да, негусто, но вот эта подходит вроде бы
Не на канате ж вешаться из-за такой уродины

Я уйду (Я уйду)
И ты меня не жди, я не вернусь
Никогда (Никогда)
И все, кто знал меня, жалеют пусть
Будешь знать (Будешь знать)
Что это значит — разбивать сердца
Я уйду
И ты назад меня не жди, овца

Ну, вот, только шуму наделал, да люстру расхуячил
Что за день сегодня такой? Сплошные неудачи
Не иначе, кто-то сглазил, не везёт, и баста
Ладно, у меня ведь в запасе есть вариант прекрасный
Вышел на крышу, ветер в рожу, за шиворот капли
Подошёл поближе к бордюру, и подумал: «Да, бля»
Нет, конечно, не струсил. Вы что, ребята?
Просто постоял, подумал и решил — высоковато
В натуре, с крыши прыгать — способ какой-то странный
Лучше спокойно дома перережу себе вены в ванной
Замёрз как раз, сейчас наберу воды погорячее
Вот самый верный путь, о чем, блин, думал-то вообще я?
Какие-то пилюли-таблетки, верёвки-табуретки
Ну, да, ещё бы в нос себе закапал яда из пипетки
Захожу домой и чувствую, что пахнет чем-то вкусным
С работы мама вернулась, сама убьёт за люстру (Люстру)

А
Я уйду (Я уйду)
И ты меня не жди, я не вернусь
Никогда (Никогда)
И все, кто знал меня, жалеют пусть
Будешь знать (Будешь знать)
Что это значит — разбивать сердца

I know you've felt the emptiness
Behind your empty words
Your silent screams confused me
Behind the mask of pride
There is nothing left
But empty words of loneliness
It's hard to select which wound to heal and which to infect
And now you feel the pain is real
You got no one else to blame
Don't let your rain fall down on me
Wish I was there to prove you wrong
It's been a while
Since you pulled the plug on me
I try to keep it together
Clenched tight as a fist
The harder I hold
More fragile it gets
Everything you touched went up in flames
I doubt that I'll ever forgive
The values that I once had don't seem to exist
And now you feel the pain is real
You got no one else to blame
Don't let your rain fall down on me
Wish I was there to prove you wrong"

How many murdered? Don't matter

Can't fake the funk at all
And bet you're gon' fall studyin the Bone Thug style
But what'cha gon' do when you face to face with the 5th Dog?

No mercy those sleep where my niggas creep
And remember they +Crept and They Came+ with Eazy
Can't calm me down, give me a pound smoke and a bong

I'm poppin quick for the dividends
I'm in it to win it, the rest of these rappers

Talkin all of that shit from the Cleveland streets?""

Is similar to a sawed-off pump hittin your chest
Rippin your vest, listen to that
You know when we comin for trouble
Cause we got 'em barrels that's runnin up on you
Ain't none of you ready for murder to bubble
I'ma pump and still I defeated them all
They was all schemin, thinkin we'd fall
Then all of a sudden we got up and balled again
Now you can't witness the hearts of men
The game was down to help it survive
We blew through like fresh oxygen
And I got my 9-millimeter cocked again
You thug niggas is not my friend


Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
When we crept wasn't nothin like this
Had to be different so we came with a twist

Better find a pattern 'til you see who it is

Akira Death,Akira Death,akira death,akira death,anger,"So, this is a view of the world
As a system of mutual exploitation
And of maximal selfishness
Now it's a very profitable view to explore
Everybody should do in their lifetime sometime (sometime)
Two things, one is to consider death

Consider death
To observe the skulls and skeletons
Consider death (Consider death)
And to wonder what it will be like to go to sleep and never wake up
Never
That is a very gloomy thing for contemplation
But it's like manure, just as manure fertilizes the plants and so on
So the contemplation of death and the acceptance of death
Is very highly generative with creative life
You get wonderful things out of that
And the other thing to contemplate is to follow the possibility of the idea that you are totally selfish
That you don't have a good thing to be said for you at all
You are a complete, utter rascal
You are a complete, utter rascal
Now, the Christians have avoided this
Because although they say, in their Episcopalian form of confession
That “We have erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep and we have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts” too much, you know?
“We have offended against they holy laws. We have left undone those things we ought to have done, and done those things which we ought not to have done, and there is no health in us.”
But, it ought to be different
And we're gonna do our best to amend with the help of God's grace
That is a real con act
If you equate health with genuine love and perfect unselfishness
Then in that sense there is no health in us when we look at ourselves from this point of view

Consider death
To observe the skulls and skeletons
Consider death (Consider death)
And to wonder what it will be like to go to sleep and never wake up
Never

Consider death
To observe the skulls and skeletons
Consider death (Consider death)

I'm wanting more than one can give
And every pore
Has left me restless in my skin
But I'm not sure
What I'm gonna be
I just adore
The tension that it brings
Don't you wait
The filth won't come off
Don't you hate?

С самого утра ходила киса с грустным лицом
Я сразу понял здесь попахивает пиздецом
Я сразу понял будет неприятный разговор
И в ночь на пятницу приснился вещий сон
Мне снилось будто я в гримёрке с какой-то кобылой
Общаюсь мило, а потом у нас чего-то было
Потом пришли её подруги- явно проститутки
Одна была мулатка, другая- лилипутка
Земля тряслась как наши груди
Смешались в кучу инструменты, кони, люди
Гамора и Содом, никаких прелюдий
Вместе мы теперь, Артём, никогда не будем
:
Ты всё разбил всё сломал, всё разрушил
Развенчал небом связанные души
Предал наши мечты и надежды
Ничего уже не будет как прежде
Никогда
:
А
Мне приснилось, что я кинул своих пацанов
Стал рекламировать снюс и онлайн казино
Все пишут, что я опопсел и что я еблан
Так блядь, такой и был план
Мне снилось, что я поменял семейный уют
На вечеринки где носок носят на хую
Типа на нём я вертел всё кроме бабла
Такой и был план
На сцене в перьях на липучках с серьезным видом
Даже Верка Сердючка сказала бы: ""Ну и пидор""
Деньги лопатой гребу, заседаю в Думе
Дети в школе врут, что их батя умер
Все кто со мною начинали гниют в позоре
Доедают лошадь в канаве с хуём без соли
Год не платил звукачу- обычное дело
Жаль этих денег не хватит чуть-чуть на Рафаэлло
Проснулся в холодном поту с сушняком во рту
Не могу понять где реальность, где вымысел тут
Звонил другу лучшему: ""Братик, послушай
Я случайно ниче не разбил не сломал, не разрушил?""
:
Ты всё разбил всё сломал, всё разрушил
Развенчал небом связанные души
Предал наши мечты и надежды
Ничего уже не будет как прежде
Никогда
:
Это просто сон, сон, сон...
Это просто сон, сон, сон...
Ты ебанулась
Это просто сон, сон, сон...
Как и твои подруги
Это просто сон, сон, сон...
Как и твой астролог

Ты всё разбил всё сломал, всё разрушил
Развенчал небом связанные души
Предал наши мечты и надежды

Kill me - Release me from this strain
Feel it - You are going to be forgotten
Taste it - The hand of unforgiveness
I injure myself
Searching for a way out
In my eyes you see
The horror of being alive
Cry for me - I need this pain to live
Hate me - I feed on your own sickness
Breathe it - The stench of self-destruction
Love it - It's the only thing that's left to you
I watch my blood flowing out
You feel your tears running down
Hold my wounded flesh now
I'm the last thing you crave for
Life is pain
We're doomed to destroy another one
Who stands in our way
'cause we were born under a cursed star
You wanted to suffer
But I need a last relief
I need to bleed
I need to kill life

And the hammers batter down the door
You better run

Saints, common thieves - each one his own to pick

Holy war? Now I see - a sacrifice a week
Infidels way: live - let live... how can you resist
Sudden urge to blow them away?
No - we're aware, your war's to get attention...
How could we dare to turn the TV off?
Raid (suicidal) - your humble share in a world's perfection
You'll meet - time is right - your idol and I hope
One bullet is enough... while you're screaming
From the top of your lungs:
Jihad! The ones who feel the pain will try to stop ""the rain
Of terror"", it's insane... I hear them screaming:
Jihad! I know who it might be: nobody else but we
The ones who hold the key...That's all they need:
Jihad! And as the time goes by we'll look upon the sky
To ask the question: ""Why they keep on screaming
Jihad?"" They're just a hostile breed that bites a hand that feeds
And loves to see it bleed - it's just a hostile breed
That cherish hate based on fear - that their religion can inspire
Nowadays. All we hear is: ""Jihad!"""

Walk through the bowels of hell, like fuck it we'll fry together
You walked out and left me here, along with a fist full of tears
I drowned in my sorrow, I can't believe i wasted this many years
You didn’t have the decency to tell me you leavin, you left a note on the dresser
Oh, what the fuck, this bitch cheatin', you left me for him?
Ho that's a good enough reason for me to come and kill both of you
Guess it's back to this grieving, it's back to these nightmares
It’s back to not sleepin', it's back to me tearing this fucking house up and screaming
I remember you cutting yourself with razors and bleeding
And you told me my love was the only reason you're breathing
I was always right there for you, I thought I was special too
What happened to us? Bitch, I'm killing whats left of you

It repeatedly, plays in my brain, it drives me insane
And of course when it rains I try to block out the pain
But fuck I just can't, get over this bitch
I think I need help, I can't get over this shit
So I muster the courage to come and knock at your door
The closer I get I feel my heart fall to the floor
You open it up, you look in my eyes
It's been a whole month, bitch, oh you look so surprised
And I get this feeling of so much rage and i grab her right by the face
And she’s screamin I’m erkin, cursin, I hate you bitch
We both spewin hatred, shit, I know i should leave
But a part of me ain't satisfied until i see her bleed
She's screaming for help, as I squeeze on her neck
You owe me this explanation for me and you separating
That shit was so devastating, I feel her soul levitating
The sound of her suffocating, she's dying from strangulation
So cold and so dark, til death do us apart
God dammit I love you, look at me falling apart
This pain is so deep, and it bites like a shark
I stick you right where you hurt me, and put this blade through her heart

Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

Uh, I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're Heaven-sent, and you're Hell-proof
I, I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy, I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up

If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream: ""Fuck 'em all""

Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Up, it's time to raise it, then your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another, I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk, you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage, and your lettuce, and olives, I'll fuckin'

And then cried 'Mary!' and I tucked up
Wi' a Claymore out and about
And I run down, down the mechyn sty
And beckoned the fiery whore
That was fallin' around the feet
""Never"", I cried. ""Never shall ye get me alive
Ya rotten hound of the Burnie Brae""
Well, I snapped for a blade and a Claymore cut and thrust
And I fell down before him 'round his feet

Aye, a roar he cried! Frae the bottom of his heart
That I would nay fall but dead, dead as a can by a feat deah...

Huh, yes

А тупой огромный нож,холодный как лёд
Его лезвие не режет,его лезвие рвёт
Передо мной один из тех,кому так хочется жить
И я не вижу причин,чтобы его не убить
Она смотрит мне в глаза,она хочет знать ответ
Она услышит да,хотя правда-этонет
Для меня это звуки-всё,что я ей скажу
Она держит мою руку,а не я её держу
Она шепчет мне прости,даже если я не прав
Она ещё отдаёт,уже последнее отдав
Она наверное из тех,кому так хочется любить
Но я не вижу причин,чтобы любовь не убить
Они друг друга убивают,топчут как тараканов
Они смазывают салом механизмы капканов
Они любят добить,когда ты уже ранен
И каждый носит за пазухой тот самый камень
Они добры напоказ,а в тихую жестоки
За свою добродетель выдавая пороки
И я такой же как все,готовый резать и бить
Совсем не вижу причин,чтобы себя не убить"

Al cor del Berguedà
Les cendres de l'oblit
Ja cerquen la foscor
Muntanya amunt
Com ombres s'alçaran
Cremant enmig del foc
Espurnes del passat
On la tristor
Envolta els seus camins
On ara hi neix el foc
Perdut enmig del bosc
Els seus pilars
Estrelles en la nit
Vigilen des del cel
Cercant l'eternitat
Criden al vent
Com garses estridents
Dançant entre voltors
Que volen lluny d'aqui
Ara ja és tard
Pеr la maledicció
Enrrera quedaran
Els anys dе lluentor
On la tristor
Envolta els seus camins
On ara hi neix el foc
Perdut enmig del bosc
Els seus pilars
Estrelles en la nit
Vigilen des del cel
Cercant l'eternitat
Encara avui s'escolten veus
Inspirades en les nits del Pedraforca
On les ombras cridaren com flames de vidre
Arrelades com estrelles perdudes
Presoneres de la foscor
Els seus arbres vessen records
Més enllà en néixer els dies de glòria
On encara els somnis revolen pletòrics
Esvaïts per moments
Rera els ulls de la boira blanca
Fugiu ara caminants
Fugiu ben lluny d'aqui...

Humanoids From the Deep,The Witch Trials,humanoids from the deep,the witch trials,anger,"I go to a drive-in, I didn’t see the movie
Something broke my windshield and reached in and clawed me
No one will believe me, the rest of the audience is ripped to shreds
But the hand with the claw was dripping red
You see, there’s a factory
Up the river with an electric fence, no sign by the road, deep in the wilderness, by the river
It’s owned by Del Monte, you remember Del Monte, their logo’s out of date
Canned fruit, canned salmon, canned people advertised on TV
Here in the factory, they tried to perfect
Bigger, tastier salmon by genetic engineering
It didn’t work, it didn’t work
Little slimy chemicals slipped down the river
And flowed into the ocean where little fishies eat it
And turned into weird-shaped slime
And came back into Fort Bragg
Lots of tourists, even in the fall
Cause in late summer, you’ve got the state fair
A slimy green claw comes up through the dock
People run away and climbing through the hole
Is a protege of Roger Corman
He photographs this mutant
Says, “I’ll make you a star
Bring me all your friends
And we’ll make a movie out of you on location
Give me five minutes to get my camera, please”
Then, so up through another floorboard comes another slimy hand
It chases all the girls in their roller skates around the square
And the county fair filled with tourists
And news reporters craving a story so they don’t lose their jobs
These so-called humanoids from the deep
Sex symbols of the slime underneath the ocean
They’re selective
Keep in mind this is Marin County, you’ve all heard of Marin County
Organic electric fences, the beautiful young rich hide here
But they all come out in their fry boots
With their money and their peasant dresses
To the Fort Bragg County Fair
They’re all here
Forming humanoids from the deep
Humanoids are selective
 roller skaters
Queen of the county fair gets her leg chomped off
Bleeds because Doug McClure can’t get to her in time
Yachts are on fire, they throw gasoline, but it does no good
Genetic mutations rising out of the water
Clawing, clawing, screaming
Beefhead American jocks who can’t get into their pickup truck in time to drive away
Red, dripping, county fair
The french fries are no longer yellow
Brace thyselves for the humanoids of the deep
Lewis Leakey, eat your heart out
We’re here to stay, to stay"

Mr. Potato Head! Ore-Ida deep-fried crinkle cut
One single cut fucks your whole LP up
You must be stupid, you liar!

Goin' against the Wu-Tang henchmen
Perfect precision marksmen, spit darts and rip charts and
Artery, shots aimed at your heart and

Undernourished, your shit cannot flourish
Cherish every moment of this life before you perish

Enter your atmosphere, dig your pussy out like a pap smear
Make you smile, at the same time, crack a tear, smack your rear

To entertain you, to give you to the ""G"", and never claim you

When you bite your bottom lip I wanna do back flips
Kiss your belly button and show you some good loving

Our love is time-proven and perfected
I like it when you show me
The endurance of a tantric yogi
You got your chocolate in my peanut butter
Spreading love with your eyelash flutter

Always ready when you hold me steady
Unplug the phone
Press my buzzer and ring my bell
Just me and you, pretending we're not home
You make me wanna write these crazy love poems
Can't get no rest cause you know I'm with the best
Always ready when you hold me steady
Keeping me on the verge
Just in time to stop while we still got the urge
Give me your spice (psst)
Snuggle up to me it feels nice

Laying on the carpet when we're feeling close knit
Deeply eternal like a secret Sanskrit
Bodies twitching (ooh)
So bewitching (ahh)
It's a fact I react every time we make contact
Feeling free as graffiti
Fall asleep with paradise dreams of Tahiti

How should I have the time of my life
I wanna know
At this time I want to be
A pawn at the service of some
Commander that could tell me what to do

Her chant makes me spin
Into a foggy afternoon
It takes my clear-sightedness
I don't know what to do
I'm falling for the first time

I wanna know
I want to go
I don't want to go

Self-inflicted sanctity

Vomit forth the fruit of eden, each breath thou taken a sin
Laceration breeds forgiveness
Rotten tissue punctured turned pure
Divine lust for the taste of blistered skin
Festering wounds spew forth the key to rapture
No shadow shall conceal a silent sinner
Infested with insects of the fallen
Haunted by angels
Rats set ablaze in hallowed fire
Gnawing through flesh to appease the flames
Claws shredded amongst stone pillars
Frantically grasping towards the heavens
Die for your God"

In remembrance,Arcana,in remembrance,arcana,fear,"Cold in the earth, and the deep snow piled above thee!
Far, far removed, cold in the dreary grave!
Have I forgot, my Only Love, to love thee,
Severed at last by Time's all-wearing wave?
Now, when alone, do my thoughts no longer hover
Over the mountains on Angora's shore;
Resting their wings where heath and fern-leaves cover
That noble heart for ever, ever more?
Cold in the earth, and fifteen wild Decembers
From those brown hills have melted into spring--
Faithful indeed is the spirit that remembers
After such years of change and suffering!
Sweet Love of youth, forgive if I forget thee
While the World's tide is bearing me along:
Sterner desires and darker hopes beset me,
Hopes which obscure but cannot do thee wrong.
No other Sun has lightened up my heaven;
No other Star has ever shone for me:
All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given
All my life's bliss is in the grave with thee.
But when the days of golden dreams had perished
And even Despair was powerless to destroy,
Then did I learn how existence could be cherished,
Strengthened and fed without the aid of joy;
Then did I check the tears of useless passion,
Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine;
Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten
Down to that tomb already more than mine!
And even yet, I dare not let it languish,
Dare not indulge in Memory's rapturous pain;
Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish,
How could I seek the empty world again?"
Enochian Calling,Coil,enochian calling,coil,fear,"Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross
Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow
And do not drop in for an after-loss:
Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe;
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow
To linger out a purposed overthrow
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last
When other petty griefs have done their spite
But in the onset come: so shall I taste
At first the very worst of fortune's might;
And other strains of woe, which now seem woe
Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so"

Has already been spilled
Vendetta
The soul demands for revenge
Punish all of those who don't have the inner strength
Lustful blood and games
Pain has too many names
Fight fire with fire
Builds up a sad and cruel empire

Between gravity and nonsense

Screams for more gore and guts

Comb it while I hum a song
Thinking of the two scores ago when I lost my wife
Wrinkled, spotted, worn hairness
Standing, staring at the land where I used to frolic
The reason I had life

Welcome to the tea time, the liquid is a metaphoric brew
Symbolize my feelings
I often sit and listen to the sun
As a means of staying attuned to my surroundings
(My surroundings, my surroundings, my surroundings, my surroundings)
Often interrupted by amplified dripping
Echoing through the house bouncing off the memories
Returning back to awakening, the finite tea is salt
(Salt, salt, salt, salt)
Sip it slowly, in rhythm with the falling 
Visions of the dance ping pong around inside
Inside where I spend most of my time
(Time, time, time)
Both the mind and the body
The other departed some time ago and left with her
And now I’m just a shell filling my insides with tea
Tears
(Tears, tears, tears, tears)

It’s the tenth day of the tenth month
Clouds darken the skies
Chill rain falls
Death’s dragon rides like 
Behind my thin wall by my small 
I brew my milk? tea
The last fruit clings to the tree
The wind 
With one blow he cuts it down

The bell tolls, awakens me from my nap
Still nothing next to me, it doesn’t change
It never will, it seems dreams of that day begin brewing
(Brewing, brewing, brewing, brewing)
Wait for the pot to sound off
You’d think I’d be enlightened with all these bells and whistles
What an oxymoron, opposition of that day
(Day, day, day, day)
Dismissal of the guilt is all too impossible
Sit with head in hands, it’s a day’s regiment
 unheard of, routine is now my best friend
(Friend, friend, friend, friend)
I’m no stranger to the cold
I welcome it to sit and share a cup
And we can talk and catch up on what is happening since we last met
My end of the conversation grows shorter every time we get together
I look up to the overcast  scared of the search for topics
To break this uncomfortable silence
Again, I’m brought back by the sounds of crits
As I sink myself in tea black with desperation
October, the time I hate the most
I feel so lonely on the tenth
More so than during the holiday season or her birthday
A bittersweet day
Signifying the beginning and the end of something beautiful

Draped in her favorite comforter
Wrapped up in what's left
We get to blink sometimes
I sip my tea
And await tomorrow"

Between Heaven
And the landing ramp
Is the sacred mathematics of Chance
The calculated risk
And the wind, whipping ya in the eyes
And the sharp, metallic taste
Of life
And death
And there is a moment of utter calm there, in mid air
A moment of sheer silence and peace
Before you hear, as if in a dream
The sound of your own voice

Evel Knievel saying goodbye to the mother of his kids
Daddy’s job is dangerous
Daddy’s job is to swim out farther and farther into the ocean
He comes back to them broken and never for very long
At a press conference he tells a reporter:
“This is what you call a one shot deal and
I’m not comin back for any late show, honey
No I have not practiced the jump
Because… there is no use practicing something that you cannot miss
And if i miss the jump in a test shot, that means im dead and will not ever get to do it for real
So this is what you call
A fucking one shot deal
This helmet
Is to protect me
From my own momentum
This costume
Is to protect you
From the realness of what is happening here!
I am calling on Death!
And she comes growling and snapping into the arena
And opens her jaws up wide on both sides of my landing ramp
Gasoline, throttle
Thumps up
Open her up
Let the arrow fly
And tear into the fabric of an instant
Where you can live an entire lifetime
In the star-dusted, flash bulb infinity
Of a launch
Into impossible space
That climbs to the top of its arc
And beats the sky back another inch
Only to crumble and collapse
Only to fall and return to the earth
With no illusions of immortality
And pay the cost of dreaming
Like your skin stretched out in ribbons along 100 yards of tar
Like those ghostly, ruined bones up there on the x-ray screen
Like the steel plates, and the pins and the screws that they put in ya
Til ya got more in common with your bike than you do with any human being
By 1976
Evel Knievel’s body is a monument in ruins
The scorched remains of a war waged against his own flesh
Born to chase after death
And kids coming home crippled from Vietnam
Write letters that say
“thank you sir
I figure that if you can get up and go on then so can i”
Evel Knievel shoots holes in the sky to keep people’s hope alive!
Even as he’s flying across the gaps between public appearances
Burning cocaine like money and women with their faces made up to look like neon motel signs
The vacancy
Of a million tv’s shining on your skin
You’re the twinkle in America’s eye
& the women come looking to lay down with Death
& you got enough money to buy into your own hype
& you got enough fuel to push you past the speed of light
Where every day you age a year
And you watch, as if in a dream
As you fail
Every single person in your life
To pay the cost of dreaming:
The botched attempts
The bankruptcys
The divorce
The loss of his family
All the bad blood in his veins is
Hepatitis, Kidney Failure
Wheelchair
Old age
Living
To feel yourself
Shrinking
To the size of a footnote
A novelty
A gag
An oddity
All of it part of the long
Drawn out revenge
Of your cowardly enemy
Robert Craig Knievel
In 2007
Telling the Hour of Power Christian Telecast
About waking up and seeing the devil in his bedroom
Speaking carefully and slowly
The broken man told the congregation of how he rose
Up in his bed and said:
‘devil! devil! you bastard you
Get away from me. i cast you out of my life
I just got on my knees and prayed then,” said evel
“i prayed that god would put his arms around me and never ever ever let me go”
He was not a good man
But he was a great man
And for that he deserves
Mercy
Death
Mercy"

Mais seulement un sur trois a survécu dans l'électricité
Ça a été une réalité dure à accepter
Le 27 octobre, Zyed et Bouna nous ont quittés
Dix-sept ans et quinze ans, eh, trop jeunes pour partir
Trop jeunes pour dire à tout l'monde
On se reverra qu'en dehors de cette terre
Vu qu'on est tous des hommes, on passera tous, tôt ou tard, par la mort mes frères

Quand des mômes fuient la police par peur jusqu'à perdre la vie
On doit s'poser des questions, moi j'suis juste un mec qui donne son avis
J'suis là pour, on a tous vu au moins une fois les civils
Déraper comme des barges dans la cour
On s'comprend plus, de là tout part
Quand même nos ministres désignent les gosses innocents coupables
Aujourd'hui j'frémis parce que j'ai trois enfants
Et garde ce dernier vers, car je sais c'que sentent les parents

Mon Dieu, j'pense à Zyed et son accent blédard
Son sourire gentil, et son pull à capuche Tim noir
Toujours serviable et jamais en colère
On l'appelait Lance-Pierres, il avait une force d'homme frère
J'pense à Bouna, toujours avec Harouna
Tout l'temps au Chêne Pointu, pourtant il habitait la PAMA
Respect aux familles Traoré et Benna
Le ghetto est en pleurs, j'en perds mes mots, Allah y rahmou

On veut savoir ce qu'il s'est passé
On veut nous cacher la vérité
Toute une communauté sous haute tension
Deux vies gâchées sans explication
Une famille perd son enfant
Impossible d'oublier, même avec le temps
Bouna, Zyed, paix à vos âmes, paix à vos âmes
Oh, paix à vos âmes, oh yeah

Sur ce son, on rappe, on dédie cette zik à Bouna et Zyed
Non j'ai du mal à croire
J'ai du mal à voir ton blaze Bouna, gravé sur du marbre
Tu t'en rappelles, chaque soir des bêtes de darka sur une rocade
Histoire d'être capital, t'avais une tête de plus que moi
Amateur de moto, danseur de XXX
À fond dans les govas et les gos, de jour en jour je deviens fou
Dans ma tête, de bons moment en boucle
Demande à tous, depuis qu't'es parti je ris mais y a plus goût à rire
Tu manques à la famille
À chaque yer-pri, je prie que Dieu vous ouvre les portes du Paradis
Sur ce, j'ai les nerfs, B2G, courageux, parole de frère

Hier, j'ai croisé l'émotion, elle touchait le fond
J'ai croisé des jeunes et j'ai croisé des mères, donc j'ai croisé le monde
J'ai croisé les doigts, crois-moi j'ai prié ma sœur
J'ai pris ma feuille, j'ai pris mon cœur et puis j'ai crié ma peur
L'amour est fiable et tu l'sais, la guerre est bad
Elle et lui vous êtes Bouna, toi et moi, on est Zyed
On est des anges, on est des grands, on est les enfants qui dérangent
Avec le cœur en sang, on chante pour tous ceux qui nous manquent

Nous sommes épuisés par les pleurs, à peine quinze ans, à fleur de vie
Bouna, ça fait drôle de plus t'voir en roue arrière sur ton vélo
Boucle d'oreille, sapé goss'bo
J'ai lancé des projectiles pour vous venger
Mais rien n'vous a réveillé, Zyed, où est passée ta tête
Qui nous écoutait l'soir à la fenêtre du premier étage ?
Parlais pas trop, trop sage
Tristesse, dépit, faiblesse nous ont envahis

La France est en deuil, le ghetto pleure deux des siens
La colère dans les yeux, deux enfants sont morts pour rien
Une pensée pour eux, lions nos deux mains
Que Dieu leur ouvre la porte des cieux et qu'ça n'arrive plus demain
Y a des écoles qui brûlent et des voitures s'embrasent
OK brûlons-la mais pas l'histoire de base
Bouna et Zyed, deux enfants morts avant l'âge
Rien qu'd'y penser, moi ça m'fout la rage, hmm

Hommage à mes deux potos, qui sont partis trop tôt
Quand j'regarde leurs photos, un frisson me monte au dos
On n'vous verra plus en mode peace à la cité
Ça fera bizarre mais c'est une triste réalité
Zyed et Bouna, malheureusement, nous ont quittés
Qu'ils demeurent au Paradis pour l'éternité
En attendant j'ai perdu deux d'mes res-frè
Si c'était à refaire, ce couplet ben je l'referais

À mes potes, Zyed et Bouna
Reposez en paix
Allah y rahmou
Pensée pour Muhittin

Ma présence n'a rien d'honorable, elle est juste normale
J'serai toujours auprès des miens tant qu'ils auront mal
C'que j'vois dans le studio, c'est beau, c'est grand
Les miens se sont unis mais pas dans l'autodestruction
Parce que les miens ont une force qu'il sont les seuls à ignorer
J'attends l'jour où ils vont s'lever, s'élever dans le respect
Que Dieu fasse miséricorde à nos frères Zyed et Bouna
Faut voir comment respecter leur mémoire

Pour Bouna et Zyed
Je prends ma plume en versant quelques larmes
Partageant la douleur
La souffrance des familles qui les pleurent
Comprendre ce qu'il s'est passé
Exposer la vérité au grand jour
Que ce fardeau soit moins lourd, oh yeah
Bouna et Zyed restent dans nos cœurs à tout jamais

C'est pour nos minots que j'retranscris mes larmes du bout d'mon stylo
Pourquoi dans nos trous à rats, s'en sortent qu'une mino'
J'tire le signal d'alarme avant d'en venir aux armes
Paix à vos âmes et à vos XXX
Morts pour rien, c'est l'slogan qui fera p't-être réagir ceux qui siègent à l'Assemblée
Nous on s'est rassemblés pour rendre hommage à nos morts
C'est à eux qu'on a dédié l'ceau-mor
Traoré et Benna, c'est à vous qu'on a dédié l'ceau-mor

Le cœur serré devant ma feuille blanche
La main tremblante, mal au crâne de voir qu'on nous écoute que quand les coins crament
Toujours la même, c'est la merde, ainsi d'suite
On veut fuir la misère à chaque course-poursuite
Que Dieu donne la force aux familles en deuil
À leurs proches pour surmonter cette dure épreuve
Dites à Nicolas que malheureusement, derrière les voitures qui brûlent
C'est la détresse des quartiers qui hurle

J'lève la main en l'air à la mémoire de nos p'tits frères
J'lève la main en l'air pour leurs pères et pour leurs mères
J'parle avec le cœur au nom d'une jeunesse en détresse
Vas-y cours petit, cours, pour fuir la tristesse
Qu'Allah leur pardonne d'avoir provoqué un drame
Aujourd'hui j'appelle au calme, il faudrait éteindre les flammes
L'âme est touchée mais le corps se relèvera
Je demande aux miens de ne jamais baisser les bras

Mourir d'sa belle mort est la chose la plus belle au monde
Mais l'destin en a voulu autrement, quelle chose immonde
Fin d'une vie humaine et des plaisirs éphémères d'la vie
Nos cœurs pleurent de désespoir et la haine nous envahit
Enivrés d'tristesse, leur non-présence nous blesse sans cesse
L'ciel a voulu qu'ils décèdent, guettent dans l'au-delà mais laisse
Une pensée à ces hommes qui n'vivent plus qu'dans nos mémoires
Quelques temps d'silence à leurs personnes XXX

La disparition de deux êtres innocents et honnêtes
A provoqué beaucoup de rivières de larmes sur les pommettes
Adolescents laissant derrière leur dos
Des centaines de pleurs, des cœurs blessés et c'est en s'en-
Traidant, en se serrant les coudes
Que l'on peut rester forts quand la mort fait escale chez nous
Salam à vous, tenez le coup, œuvrez dans l'bien
Difficile pour une famille d'avancer avec un membre en moins

J'commence en faisant deux mesures de silence pour les enfances perdues
En guise d'insulte pour tous les esprits tordus
(...)
Sa mère! J'ai les nerfs de voir nos pères en larmes
J'ai les nerfs de voir mes frères s'noyer dans l'drame
Et lors d'un banal contrôle dans nos halls on a le rôle d'un animal pour la Gaule
De vandales pour les héritiers d'De Gaulle

XXX
La France pays de rencontres XXX
XXX

La douleur parle, nous on perd des frères
C'est juste un appel au calme dans cette époque de merde
Paix à la famille, laissez-la faire son deuil
J'verse une goutte sur l'sol et vers l'ciel j'jette un œil
Ça fait mal quand quelqu'un part mais c'est Dieu qui décide
On s'retrouvera plus tard, sur la route sur laquelle on s'destine
Morts pour rien, pour vous on a beaucoup d'estime
Que Dieu vous garde, OK, reposez en paix

À nos frères morts violemment, aux plus jeunes qui prouvent qu'on peut réussir brillamment
Le plus important, l'dîn, on veut tous partir dignement
Rattraper nos péchés, à part les drames, rien pour nous unir
C'est c'qui nous manque, combien passeront la barre des trente
Vies courtes mais intenses, profite des tiens, porte avec honneur toutes nos valeurs
Décharger les mamas du poids d'nos malheurs
Dramatique pour les familles blessées dans l'âme
Résister pour exister, wesh les p'tits frères, faut éviter l'haram

Y a trop d'souffrances au cœur des abysses dans les quartiers d'France
Alerte maximum pour les mômes, état d'urgence
J'porte des fleurs pour les morts, faut qu'on y pense
Et qu'on sème de l'espoir pour le futur
Même si la poisse rend l'quotidien trop dur, même si les pleurs parlent quand des gosses partent
N'oublions pas qu'les anges ne meurent pas
C'est juste quelques mots en votre mémoire
Votre histoire gravée sur le marbre, un hommage pour dire qu'y en a marre

Un hommage à Benna, Traoré
Deux p'tits frangins Allah y rahmou, qui sont partis haja
Morts pour rien, là où vous êtes Inch'Allah vous êtes bien
Beau temps, mauvais temps, vous étiez toujours contents
J'ai du mal à réaliser qu'le temps nous a séparés
Le mal qu'ils nous ont fait, ils pourront jamais le réparer
(XXX, Traoré
Quelle époque nous vivons, quelle époque
C'est pour XXX)

Quelle époque nous vivons, perdre sa vie sans raison
Sans explication, la banlieue pleure à l'unisson
Mais quelle époque nous vivons? On veut savoir le pourquoi du comment
Dialogue de sourds, on nous répond en nous insultant
Mais quelle époque nous vivons? Trop p'tits pour partir d'nos rangs
Pas assez d'mots pour apaiser les parents
Mais quelle époque nous vivons? D'autres agissent en cassant
Manière douce, nous on transforme notre rage en chanson

J'connais l'respect, pas celui qui sort d'la bouche des autres
Celui qu'on m'a appris depuis tout gosse mais on est tous des hommes
Ça m'désole et on s'demande que faire face à tout c'désordre
Et pour s'faire entendre, faut qu'la voix d'mes couz' résonne
Plus rien n'est sûr quand y a l'sheitan et ses miss qui zonent
Mais qu'ils ont, à croire que ça leur plaît d'voir une enfance qui XXX
Pendant qu'les best pigeonnent, j'vois le reste qui chôme
Nous on est jeunes, plein d'avenir et c'est toute ma tristesse qui somme

Dites-moi comment régler les problèmes en supprimant les solutions
Ce système a trop sous-estimé sa population
L'oppression a une faille, nous a enlevé deux de nos frères
C'est les larmes aux yeux que l'on pratique notre prière
93, volcan en éruption, banlieue poudrière
On n'éteint pas notre flamme, c'est jusqu'à la mort qu'on sera solidaire
Tremblay en hommage, ma ville crame, lâchez les Canadair
Y a rien à dire, dors avant d'partir en guerre

Histoire triste, j'suis pas là pour m'faire d'la pub
Les chtars guidés par Ibliss frère, ici ça devient rude
Perdre deux d'nos proches pendant l'ramdam
Une pensée hardcore pour les rents-pa qui pleurent l'âme
I.S.L.A.M., ma source vitale
Apprendre la mauvaise nouvelle d'un mort, mon frère, ça on l'vit tous mal
J'accepte plus l'mektoub, les soucis ressurgissent
Combien d'enfants avec une tombe avant qu'la France agisse

Respect aux familles, aux amis, aux manifestants
Existants, restant résistants
Et exigeant, détestant les forces, les testant
Et quel ordre? C'est l'désordre qui est présent
Fort déplaisant, unis dans tous les sens
Munis d'encre ou d'essence personne n'est perso
Ou hésitant, devant c't accident attristant
A cité ta cité s'assistant

Le mal au moment qu'tu ressens parce que t'es blessé par le mal qui ronge
Tu tombes dans la dépression parce que les événements pour toi sont étranges
Pour tous mes frères qui sont victimes d'avoir perdu un être cher
Parce que le fruit d'un amour fraternel vient de disparaître
J'ai reflété un mal de vivre parce que mes nerfs sont devenus ivres
Parce que les gens ne m'épargnent pas, j'ai dû survivre
Un petit sourire levé vers l'ciel, une éclaircie, l'soleil
Ça prouve qu'on doit sécher nos larmes parce que nos âmes sont éternelles

Dur d'clamer la paix alors qu'la liste ne fait qu's'allonger
Ça m'enrage que nos vies s'embrasent pendant qu'Arnaud rêve à la vie d'Pete Sampras
Les meilleurs s'en vont toujours les premiers, c'est pas d'leur faute
Les prolos s'lavent les mains dans l'sang des nôtres
Arrête de foutre le feu chez nos daronnes, déjà qu'elles sont mal logées
Au fond, ça n'arrangera rien, tu sais
Pense à nos martyrs et rappelle-toi qu'avant d'partir
Il te faudra chérir la mif, qu'on arrête de courir car tu peux mourir vite

Même un daron du bled fier ne peut retenir ses larmes
Face à des mères accablées comme celles de Bouna et Zyed
L'insomnie s'empare des familles du défunt
Mais des fois, il n'y a pas de douleur que le sommeil sache vaincre
Hache de guerre à gauche frolo pour un effort de paix
C'est l'9-3 qui pleure quand Clichy-sous-Bois est en deuil
J'ai de la peine car le décès de certains me reviennent en tête
Les frères, laissez-vous bercer par la tristesse

Sauvons les deux âmes
Comment résister, honorer son charme
Zyed et Bouna
Nous restons sans voix
Quelle choc de ne plus vous revoir
Sur mon visage ne cessent de couler les larmes
Que Dieu vous garde pour l'éternité

J'ai l'cœur brisé, car j'ai souvent rêvé d'un monde meilleur
Que la guérilla urbaine et d'enterrer deux frères
Traoré Benna, que Dieu vous pardonne
Que Dieu vous ouvre les portes du Paradis
Que la tension se calme ici-bas
J'suis un frère parmi tant d'autres
J'voulais faire passer un message de paix

Mon phrasé porte le deuil
On vient d'perdre deux âmes fraîches, deux anges
On vient encore d'perdre deux p'tits frères
On leur rend hommage le cœur noyé dans nos larmes
Nos plumes portent nos peines et les blessures de nos âmes
Les cris sincères, ouala j'ai mal
La douleur est intense et même le silence pleure
Pas là pour condamner l'coupable, Dieu l'fera Lui-même
Et qu'la paix soit avec la famille d'ces deux lumières

Deux gouttes qui débordent le vase, écoute
Le mal se disperse, les man se disent prêts à agir et à serrer les coudes
Les poings en l'air et même sur les I
Quand on est solidaire, qu'on attise la flamme et à deux morts on l'dédie
Trop d'sirènes, pompiers flics et ambulances
Qu'on allume un cierge au lieu d'ces ambiances brûlantes
La délinquance n'est pas une profession dans la street
Qu'ils arrêtent leurs étiquettes et d'nous classer dans leurs putain d'statistiques

27/10/05, c'est la fin d'une vie, les larmes d'une mère
Le calvaire d'un père et l'combat d'un grand frère
Une sœur perdue qui voit son frère partir au plus jeune âge
Une mort incomprise et toute une tess qui prend la rage
Un événement qui prend une tournure grave, des nuits d'émeute
Avec une seule idée en tête, faut qu'y en ait un qui crève
On veut la vérité pour Zyed et Bouna
Une forte pensée pour les familles, Traoré Benna

Crois-moi, j'ai eu froid dans le dos
En entendant les commentaires de politiques au lendemain du drame
Quand la loi et l'ordre font peur à des gosses et que le pire se passe
Le respect, c'était de faire profil bas
Il nous faut des responsables, ça doit pas toujours marcher dans un sens
Parce que c'qu'il s'est passé n'a pas d'sens
Mes pensées vont aux familles, alors rest in peace
Mon Dieu, entends nos prières, c'est pas juste c'qui arrive

Deux frères partent, des cœurs fanent, la violence pour morphine, frère
Mon cœur saigne, mon cœur parle, mon cœur aime, mon cœur bat
Aussi vite que l'approche de la vérité, donc militer
Pour la même cause, même veine, même combat
Familles Traoré et Benna
Beaucoup d'force et beaucoup d'chance pour la suite frères, pour tous les miens
On a les mains réanimées par les armes
Ensanglantées mais vite lavées par les larmes, paix à leurs âmes

Nettoyer les gouttes et lâche même des gouttes et
Les frères sont dégoûtés, les parents sont alarmés
Morts pour rien, seul l'avenir nous l'dira
Ou en tirer une leçon les jours à venir on verra
Pour l'heure, une prière pour les p'tits frères
Une pensée à leurs parents en espérant d'meilleurs moments
Né d'une mort, l'espoir vit, restons forts
Clichy-sous-Bois Montfermeil présentent leur reconnaissance

Des adolescents parés
Pour cette oppression incessante, donc une vie de tarés
Grandir sous l'enseigne Montfermeil Clichy
Mon cœur saigne, tu sais, tant de gâchis
Re-fré, réfléchis, deux vies ont fléchi
Ils ont dit qu'on agissait par haine
Plus rien ne sert de défendre une vie déjà vaine
Mais allez dire ça aux mères
Que leurs fils méritait une vie éphémère
XXX
Parce qu'on nous a traités d'vauriens
J'dédicace aux gosses morts pour rien

Seule la violence du désespoir dégage cette odeur de peur
Quand un jeune des ghettos meurt, je pleure
De colère, c'est ça qui fait brûler les voitures
Saoulé d'devoir enterrer les nôtres, vois-tu
Français, écoute pas leurs putain d'histoires
Si on agit ainsi c'est par la force du désespoir
Comme à Clichy quand la mort t'électrocute
Et combien d'raisons justifie leur mort? Aucune

Le ghetto parle, le ghetto chante, le ghetto pleure
Des larmes de peine
C'est triste à dire, qu'il faille le pire
Pour qu'on écoute nos cœurs qui saignent
Mes pensées vont vers les familles Benna et Traoré, yeah
Le ghetto pleure ces deux adolescents
Un message de paix dans toute cette effervescence

J'parle au nom du 7-7
Mes amitié pour les familles des défunts, c'est pour ces jeunes qu'on s'mobilise
Une prose contre une rose
Hommage à Bouna et Zyed, nos banlieues pleurent
L'onde de choc retentit, j'crie ma douleur
Un requiem pour ceux qu'on aime
Nos HLM sont en berne, trop d'pertes et d'chrysanthèmes
J'veux pas finir dans les bras du système
Électrocuté ou cané, alors j'tire la sonnette d'alerte

La mort ne donne jamais de rendez-vous
Les khos, levez vos index dès que vous savez qu'elle va venir à vous
J'avoue, ça fait si mal d'voir partir des p'tits et des fillettes
De voir que de drames, la vie est ainsi faite
Qu'Allah fasse miséricodre à Bouna et à Zyed
Ils voudraient nous étouffer pour mieux nous avaler comme le ferait un boa
La tasse ils veulent nous faire boire
Paix à nos morts, d'ici à Clichy-sous-Bois

Ils sont morts, ma voix gèle, j'suis rouge, tout est pêle-mêle
J'vous connaissais pas mais au fond vous êtes une partie d'moi
Moi j'pleure, rien que j'pleure
C'est dur, la France a peur, comprenez notre émotion
Trop d'nos frères à terre, deux (ouais), ils étaient deux
Pour le troisième, j'remercie Dieu
Hein, sois fort Muhittin
J't'assure, sois fort

C'est pour nos deux p'tits frères, rest in peace
Que j'lance d'ici, d'Évry-Courcouronnes à Clichy
Si si, à prendre les jeunes pour des imbéciles
C'est la douleur du ghetto qui se transforme en missile
Et la banlieue ne veut plus lécher la vitrine
Elle est brisée, et c'est la vérité que l'on vise
La rue a mal, mais pas que depuis hier
Et aujourd'hui les pierres ont remplacé les prières

Hommage aux familles blessées
Agressées dans leur chair, Seigneur dissipe leur gêne et le poids de leur détresse
Chéris nos p'tits frères partis jeunes
Pendant ce saint mois d'jeûne
On en a marre de cette animosité qui règne, nous divise et nous trahit
Mitraillés dans cette lutte perpétuelle qu'est la quête de notre salut
Bouna et Zyed, dans nos mémoires à jamais gravés

Pour Bouna, Zyed, j'ai l'cœur qui palpite
J'ai mal quand sans état d'âme, on prend l'âme
À deux d'mes frères, RR, j'ai la rage
Quand les larmes ressortent sur un drame
Dans l'9-3 c'est ça, c'est cette situation qu'j'condamne
J'rends hommage aux familles, j'prends mon briquet, j'allume la flamme
Pour qu'tu voies d'en-haut ma tristesse pendant la salate
J'fais une dou3a pour qu'tu partes en paix, refré

Négro, on était en exode
Mais j'pense qu'ils veulent nous voir visés, nos phases macabres et nos XXX
XXX faut canaliser
Gardez la foi mais faut que j'aie ce condé parce que nos vies sont jeu d'l'oie
Prie pour pas tomber sur la case d'un colt
Une mauvaise phrase comme nos refrés jouent à ""Liberté ou Volt""
On sait comment ça finit
Un clash, une course-poursuite, un crash, la suite, un putain d'incendie

Deux âmes partent, un mot d'provoc' et la France crame
Sarko en tête des sondages, man, à qui profite le scandale?
Malaise perceptible, chômage trafic et vente d'armes
Tout l'monde s'affole parce que notre rap c'est pas du France Gall
Anti flics et gendarmes, politique, chantage
Contrôle où les képis semblent avoir dix ans d'âge
Les deuils tournent dans les p'tites villes et grands axes
Comme toute tragédie, l'histoire est triste et la fin semblable

J'comprends pas pourquoi la vie est si dure, man
Comment ça se fait, on peut perdre sa vie bêtement
Combien de temps ils vont faire pleurer nos mamans
Combien de temps ils vont nous marcher sur les pieds, man
Traoré et Benna ne méritaient pas ça
Mouille avec la peur au ventre pour une histoire de balles
Y en a marre d'être mal catalogués
Le ghetto pleure c'est la rue cette réalité

Cause conséquence, voilà l'revers d'la médaille
Les chèques d'assurance nous ramèneront pas les deux p'tits frères die
27/10/5, Zyed, Bouna rendent leur âme
Parole de grand, personne n'oubliera cette date, ce drame
Maximum respect, pensée pour leurs milles-fa
Leurs proches amis pour qui ça doit vraiment pas être cile-fa
Perdre un être cher aussi jeune, c'est trop dar
J'pose huit roses en leur mémoire, car trop tard

C'est envers mes frères que je m'adresse car cette histoire m'attriste et blesse
Mon cœur saigne mais seule l'encre de ma plume se verse
C'est d'la haine que tu peux lire dans mes yeux
Mais c'est avec le cœur serré qu'j'écris, un regard vers les cieux (Allah!)
On m'a dit d'calmer donc j'garde la rage en moi
Parce qu'un Black reste un Black, même vénère il reste une proie
J'ai mal mais remplace mon arme par des larmes
Car les flammes qu'il peut ne feront jamais revenir vos âmes

Il n'y a pas pire enfer que d'penser qu'le Paradis n'existe pas
En c'moment-même, les esprits des défunts nous hantent
Ambiance de paix car j'ai le mal de guerre
De quartier en quartier ça brûle parce que ce sont nos frères
On va laisser les rancunes en route
Apporter des gerbes de fleurs aux textes pour apaiser les têtes
Chaque jour, des bougies s'allument et s'éteignent
Bouna et Zyed, de leurs lueurs on s'imprègne

Tout arrive par ici
On envisage le pire
Tous en état de crise
Bouna, Zyed, martyrs
La violence contre l'innocence
Les héros n'existent plus depuis longtemps
Ils ont bafoué votre enfance
Gardez-nous une place, on vient dans peu de temps

Oh, tous les quartiers ont les larmes aux yeux
Trop de larmes pouvant éteindre le feu qui leur traversait l'corps
En traversant mon cœur, mon sentiment fut renversé
Par un poids-lourd immatriculé par la mort
L'amour et la mort, des extrêmes qui s'kiffent à mort
Zyed, Bouna, destins liés par des câbles
Si mon cœur aurait eu des yeux, tu l'aurais vu saigner
Benna,Traoré, Allah y rahmou, Sefyu

Coupés dans leur élan, trop tôt ces jeunes sont die
Deux familles, toute une génération en deuil, ma gueule
Ç'aurait pu être un d'tes frelons, un d'mes frelons
L'idée fait froid dans l'dos alors qu'j'suis pas tant qu'ça un frileux
Vu qu'j'fais partie des cibles, il est donc impossible
Qu'j'y sois insensible, des familles pleurent
Bouna, Zyed, partez en paix vers l'ciel
Nous on continue l'combat, qu'vous soyez pas morts dans l'zef

C'est avec peine et haine que j'prends c'putain d'micro
Car au-devant d'la scène, t'as la mort d'mes deux frelos
À qui j'dédie c'morceau pendant ce temps d'fléau
Ça vient du cœur khey, j't'assure qu'c'est pas du mytho
En bref, malgré ma froideur, sur c'beat j'ouvre mon cœur
Pour rejoindre les deux familles dans leur propre douleur
Et quoi qu'il arrive, pour nous, vous êtes toujours là
À jamais gravés dans nos cœurs, Zyed et Bouna

J'remplace l'alcool par de l'eau céleste, le bédo par une datte
On s'connaît pas mais c'est pour Bouna et Zyed
À c'que j'vois, vous aviez des potes et des gens qui vous aiment
Depuis votre mort, les jeunes ont déployé leurs ailes
J'ai le cœur noué, Bellahi je le jure c'est vrai
À nous tous, ça peut tous nous arriver
J'envoie des dou3as pour vos familles, vos larmes inondent toutes nos villes
Et votre mort résonne dans toutes nos vies

J'peux pas camoufler ma peine, j'peux pas camoufler ma haine
Hémorragie interne, j'me porte bien mais l'cœur saigne
Une flamme subsiste pour Bouna et Zyed
Siaka, Biggie, Montfermeil Clichy
Maillot, Silly, Sur-Marne-Neuilly
Sachez qu'le 9-3 côté Est ne vous oublie
La Tunisie, la Mauritanie aussi, ces lignes vous sont dédiées
À vous et vos familles, pour vous, j'garderai bonne mine, promis

Ma plume se plie, les mots sont trop lourds
Des actes injustifiés qui emmènent des conséquences trop lourdes
Conscients que le temps passe, de nos esprits rien ne s'efface
Mes frères, je vous embrasse, nos vies s'éteignent, les frères j'vous rends hommage
Le remède c'est qu'on s'entraide
Tu sais pour qui on plaide, il était une fois Bouna et Zyed
Partis trop tôt, Allah y rahmou, message de paix en votre mémoire
Vos noms sont gravés à jamais dans notre histoire

Mort subite que nous n'oublieront jamais reste gravée dans nos mémoires
On peut pas s'en débarrasser comme le reflet d'un miroir
Accrochés à la réalité, mes reufs s'en sortiront
Triste destinée, pour réussir prêts à se prosterner
Consternés par la tournure des choses
Mourir, ou lutter tous pour nos familles et disparus
Korozeef, message du cœur
Ceci nous rappelle que toute âme revient au Créateur

Ouais
J'ai le cœur qui saigne
Tant de compassion s'imprègne
Au-dedans de moi, des choses me font perdre la foi
De voir des jeunes s'en aller aussi souvent que ça
Je compatis, c'est si triste
La justice grise, nos ciels sans couleurs
Un venin de couleuvre
Déjà trop dans nos vies, détruit nos frères et sœurs

Ils nous brutalisent, la justice couvre
La presse se rend complice et personne ne l'ouvre
La pensée réactionnaire connaît des joies intenses
Quelles sont les premières victimes en proie à la violence?
Ceux qui ravalent leurs mots jusqu'à vomir des pierres
Ceux qu'on réprime dans le sang comme en temps de guerre
Bouna et Zyed, juste jeunes et envie de vivre
Qui n'en demeurent pas moins des exemples à suivre

Bouna, en entendant ton nom ou en voyant ta photo
Des milliers de flashbacks me remontent au cerveau
Je t'avais appris à nager
Je me rappelle ce jour-là, t'as failli te noyer
Je t'ai côtoyé depuis ta tendre enfance
Je me rappelle de toi, m'étant décroché avec la plus grande aisance
La BDS a shooté votre crew
Mais avec le temps cette équipe s'est dissoute
Biggie, Kahi, mon p'tit frère est parti
Que Allah lui ouvre les portes du paradis

Encore des anges qui partent trop tôt dans l'ghetto
Et la tristesse fait couler l'encre de mon stylo
C'est avec la main sur l'cœur que j'lâche mes mots
J'ai d'la rage, j'ai d'la haine, j'ai d'la peine et j'n'arrêterai pas s'il faut
Ça a toujours été nous contre eux
On est rien dans c'bas monde, que Dieu vous garde
Nous on restera sur nos gardes
C'est dans les cieux que vos frères et sœurs vous regardent, Zyed et Bouna

Une mesure de silence
Pour nos frères Bouna, Zyed auxquels on pense
À l'heure actuelle, vos noms sont gravés dans nos têtes
Que vos âmes reposent en paix, c'est tout c'qu'on souhaite
La main sur l'cœur, la mille-fa plongée dans la douleur
Triste sort, la mort est venue frapper à leur porte de bonne heure
Sous nos bonnets on a d'la peine
Comme tu l'sais, dans nos quartiers, seule la mort règne et les cœurs saignent

Encore deux d'nos p'tits partis, ça suffit
Pour Bouna, Zyed avec qui j'avais pas encore d'affinités
C'qui n'empêche pas d'témoigner ma solidarité
Militer afin d'limiter, les saignements d'nos cœurs déjà irrités
D'une tristesse profonde, on est tous héritiers
Une larme tombe, mais peut-on les éviter
J'ai un frère du même âge, voilà la vérité
À vous et vos familles, j'rends hommage avec sincérité

J'viens rendre hommage, Mister Daï
De Neuilly-sur-Marne à Clichy, j'vous épargne mes analyses car l'résultat sera l'même
Ça m'fait mal, j'ai d'la peine, alors ma haine j'la canalise
Rien ne pourra faire qu'ils nous reviennent, j'en ai les membres qui s'paralysent
Le poing gauche serré, la tête baissée, la main droite sur l'cœur
J'en place une pour la famille qui auront toujours ce mal au cœur
J'm'exprime en leur mémoire parce qu'ils manqueront jamais à l'appel
Que leur flamme s'éteigne en paix, que leurs âmes reposent en paix

Une couronne de fleurs pour Zyed et Bouna
Ça fait mal au cœur, on ne peut que supporter leur mille-fa
Difficile de consoler après la mort
Sur la tombe d'un proche, c'est tellement dur de rester fort
Obligé de contenir ma pensée
Par respect pour leur mémoire, donc je vais me contrôler
La vérité n'est jamais facile à dire
Attendons de la savoir, pour l'instant calmons les tirs

D'abord mes condoléances aux frères, aux sœurs, aux rent-p's
Aux amis qui étaient si chers au cœur de Zyed et Bouna
Pour lesquels je cace-dédi ce rap, même si j'les connaissais as-p
Mec, je suis à-l, ouais, à cent pour cent avec eux, avec mon cœur et mon âme
Pour que ce genre d'événement ne se perpétue as-p
On tue les jeunes dans nos tiers-quar, tis-gra
Faudrait qu'ça cesse parce qu'on commence à en avoir vraiment marre

J'ai le cœur en sang, j'ai du mal à caresser
J'ai des sentiments bloqués
XXX des petits frères sont die
Pour m'en remettre faut plus qu'une douille, khey
Je suis banlieusard, blesse pas les mêmes même si l'envie de mitraille
Graille, y a cette envie de tout fumer
Mais au fond ça sert à rien maintenant comme notre quartier est cramé
Pour les madres, poto, fais preuve de respect
Tout se paie, que leurs âmes reposent en paix

Dur d'en parler sans offenser vu qu'la douleur est encore vive
Ce rap est une prière pour nos deux frères partis trop vite
Que Dieu les garde, que Dieu protège leurs familles
Que Dieu leur donne d'la force et du courage pour affronter la vie
Paix à leurs amis, soyez gardiens d'leur souvenir
D'leurs visages, d'leurs sourires, sachez qu'on est tous avec vous
Même si c'est l'mektoub, on s'demande quand même XXX
C'est pour Zyed et Bouna, Allah y Rahmo

XXX 
Si la douleur noyait nos âmes
Si les pleurs nous arrachaient nos dernières armes
Si l'on avait  pris la vie de nos enfants
XXX 
Si la douleur noyait nos âmes
Si les pleurs nous arrachaient nos dernières armes
Si l'on avait  pris la vie de vos enfants

Dans l'ghetto, on a perdu l'sourire, on n'arrive même plus à rire
On a vu des frères partir et plus jamais revenir
La haine, la rage, la tristesse dans nos yeux, ça m'fait tellement réfléchir
Mais qui accuser, Dieu l'a voulu
Il crée des trucs, comment puis-je
Avoir la haine envers mon Créateur, c'est cru
J'n'arrive même plus à fermer les yeux
Les souvenirs du passé n'cessent de me hanter
Ça m'fait bizarre d'ressasser le passé

J'rends hommage à ces p'tits partis trop tôt, partis pour rien
Une pensée aux familles c'est 15-24 soutien
Un départ prématuré, ils sont privés de c'monde pourri
On est blessés à jamais, que leurs esprits reposent en paix

C'est dommage, surtout à leur âge
Et j'me demande encore pourquoi on n'est pas tous devenus sages
Mais l'seul message, c'est qu'y a encore des parents
Qui ont perdu leurs enfants, et ça tirons-en un enseignement
La vie est bien trop courte pour qu'on s'fasse la guerre
La vie est bien trop courte, profitons d'nos frères
S'mobiliser, c'est bien, changer les choses c'est mieux
Instant d'paix en espérant qu'on vivra tous vieux

Quoi qu'il arrive, on doit rendre des comptes
Pose pas la question pourquoi, on y passe tous
Qu'la vie soit longue ou XXX
Mais la mémoire elle reste, comme quand on s'pose
Y a la dignité d'deux êtres qui s'impose
Quelques mesures pour la mesure du monde immonde
Où on traîne nos corps en attendant la suite
Que vos noms soient jamais oubliés
Bouna, Zyed, c'est nous pour vous à jamais

Demande du calme, ne transformons pas notre deuil en drame
Laissons couler nos larmes, demande la paix face aux armes
Mais t'es un fou, renoi c'est nos p'tits frères qui sont partis pour rien
Toujours nos mères qui pleurent, toujours cette putain de haine au cœur
Cesse tes rancœurs, on a l'devoir de calmer la rage
Avec un grand cœur, nous sommes unis pour faire un hommage
Ça sera toujours les mêmes personnes qui y laisseront des plumes
Notre quartier fume, il faudra bien que quelqu'un l'assume
Qu'on s'le dise, y aura pas d'paix sans l'mot respect
Zyed et Bouna, que vos âmes reposent en paix

Négro c'est l'deuil, coupe le moteur de l'YZ
Mon stylo pleure d'l'acide au nom d'Bouna et Zyed
Tristesse et rage, jeunesse arrachée par la Faucheuse
La mort n'attend personne et on confie son âme à Dieu
Saluer la République, y a pas moyen
Tout c'que j'ai retenu d'la Marseillaise, c'est ""aux armes, citoyens""
Mais bref, paix à vos âmes et vos familles
En bas c'est l'anarchie, banlieusard on s'trompe pas d'ennemis

Un jour ensoleillé, partie d'foot avant de couper l'jeûne
Qui aurait pu savoir que vous nous quitteriez si jeunes
Muhittin s'en sort, je n'crois pas qu'ce soit dû au hasard
Sans son courage, où en aurait été l'histoire
Vous nous manquez, infermables sont nos plaies
Aujourd'hui tous deux XXX
Le cœur meurtri par ce triste drame
Nos plumes pleurent pour vos familles, rendons un hommage

Toutes mes condoléances, à ma manière j'fais acte de présence
Ramène ma pierre à l'édifice pour œuvre de bienfaisance
L'amour en abondance pour les familles en deuil, ouais j'y pense
Questions sans réponses, les familles demandent leur existence
Clichy Montfermeil en deuil condamne à sa manière
À quinze ans finir grillés en revenant du foot, quelle manière
XXX ouais, tout cqu'on peut faire, faire une bonne prière, que Dieu nous garde
Pour qu'une telle chose ne s'reproduise guère et être sur nos gardes

On veut savoir ce qu'il s'est passé
On veut nous cacher la vérité
Toute une communauté sous haute tension
Deux vies gâchées sans explication
Une famille perd son enfant
Impossible d'oublier, même avec le temps
Bouna, Zyed, paix à vos âmes, paix à vos âmes
Oh, paix à vos âmes, oh yeah

L'Soleil se lève à l'Est mais se couche chez moi
Ouais Dakar Westside, trop dur à meurtrir
Chaque rime que j'écris, ouais j'la vis sincèrement
J'ai d'l'amour pour mes reufs et ils en ont pour moi
Et j'dis ""repose en paix"" à Zyed et Bouna
Traoré family là-bas à Clichy-sous-Bois
Nos p'tits reufs sont partis mais pour moi ils sont là
Ouvre les portes du Paradis frère Incha'Allah

Deux soldats partis trop tôt
Deux familles vidées d'larmes sur le corps de leurs marmots
Visage rouge de ta mère posée sur ta photo
Ton père insomniaque n'arrête pas les cent pas
Dans la baraque c'est l'enterrement XXX
Dehors c'est toute la tess qui porte la douleur des défunts
Octobre 2005, Zyed et Bouna morts pour rien
J'lâche ma haine sur faf pour rendre hommage dans l'ons

Une journée d'jeunes tranquilles, au soir la ville s'embrase
Où s'déversent des flammes à l'annonce de c'double drame
XXX l'avenir du tier-quar où la ville réclame justice
Où les proches portent un pesant deuil
Au lendemain matin, une marche silencieuse en leur mémoire
Accompagnée d'un douloureux fleuve de larmes
La famille appelle au calme
Bouna, Zyed, entre les mains du Tout-Puissant retournent vos âmes

J'écris ce texte en larmes parce qu'il faut poser les armes
Poison revient avec tristesse sonner l'alarme
La mort un fléau qui frappe sur tous les réseaux
Les réseaux auxquels ce XXX obscur nous atteint
Parce que le diable a fait des sondages très tôt l'matin
J'rends hommage à mes frères morts
C'est vrai qu'cette vie elle est trop hardcore
Et la haine continue à semer la guerre tous les soirs dehors
Ça m'fait mal parce que ç'aurait pu être toi ou moi, mon frère

Les nerfs à fleur de peau, j'ai les yeux chargés le cœur gros
J'ai perdu deux p'tits frères (Bouna, mon p'tit Zyed)
Et même si s'enflamme le ghetto, qu'la haine s'empare de mon cerveau
Je sais j'peux rien y faire

C'est juste un message pour te dire que leur mort me blesse
Qu'elle me met mal à l'aise, me provoque un malaise
Donc comment veux-tu qu'j'me taise?
Mais j'demande une trêve pour Zyed et Bouna et leurs rents-pa
Que leurs enfants reposent en paix
Et j'veux qu'vous sachiez que même dans l'9-5, on a d'la peine

Ces quelques lignes sont juste une note de plus pour essuyer vos larmes
Une épaule fiable sur laquelle vous pouvez reposer vos peines
Un partage de douleur pour cautériser une plaie
Essayer d'alléger l'épreuve tout en restant discret
C'est l'cœur empli de compassion que je m'adresse à vous
Pour eux à qui on a fermé les yeux sans même qu'ils n'aient vu l'jour
Restant conscient que chez vous le malheur accable
Ne vous fiez pas à la parole de ceux qui vous disent responsables

Vingt-sept octobre, triste jour à Clichy-sous-Bois
Mes condoléances aux familles Traoré et Benna
Des fils, des p'tits frères, des amis morts comme des soldats
Même dans nos pires cauchemars, ça finit pas comme ça
Partir avant l'âge c'est pourri comme subir pour rien
Ça manque d'amour dans leur Justice, ses fourgons et XXX
Des pleurs, des peurs, des préjugés, l'injustice des bourrins
Hommage à Zyed et Bouna, morts pour rien

J'ai rêvé une vie
D'égalité, de fraternité, une vie de liberté
J'ai rêvé la paix, j'ai rêvé la guérison
J'ai rêvé l'réveil du peuple, j'ai rêvé le calme et la raison
J'ai rêvé l'extase, j'crois qu'j'ai rêvé le Paradis
Et v'là qu'j'me réveille avec cet étrange souvenir
Si doux et douloureux, cruelle dichotomie
J'ai rêvé les sourires de ceux qu'on laisse mourir

Huit mesures pour apporter mon soutien moral
Prolonger le deuil en musique
Sensibiliser les gens qui se souviennent du drame, car
Ils n'ont parlé qu'des gymnases qui crament dans leurs rubriques
Alors que deux anges ont quitté la banlieue pour le ciel
27/10/05, Bouna, Zyed, hommage
C'est parce que ça m'tient à cœur si j'plaide
Yeah, Gino

De l'amertume pour les disparus, de si jeunes espoirs déchus
On grandit sous pression, oppression
Des fois c'est lourd le deuil, chez nous les gens tombent
Cette fois c'est ici, Clichy, d'où part la bombe
Mais partout tu trouves des tombes dans les quartiers
Y a l'âge de la rébellion, l'âge de la raison
ADM réflexion
Des p'tits frères partent mais où est la direction?
En attendant, d'la famille, j'donne mon soutien, mon courage, mes mots

Que leur âme repose en paix, c'est pour ceux partis trop vite
J'ai juste huit lignes pour dire qu'on les oubliera jamais
De Clichy-sous-Bois à Vitry-sur-Seine, mon frère
Tous en larmes, quand on t'fait part de ce drame
Même s'il est difficile de s'contenir, j'lance un appel au calme
Agissons dans le bon sens avant qu'les choses ne s'aggravent
Une pensée aux familles des disparus, courage
Même s'il est difficile de garder l'moral

Je refuse que nos petits frères meurent dans l'indifférence
Rien ne pourra combler le vide de leur absence
Être méprisés, c'est assez de souffrance
Tous ces vœux ne leur donneront pas une nouvelle chance
Toutes ces douleurs n'auront jamais de délivrance
À ces familles je présente mes condoléances
Écoutez vos cœurs, ignorez la violence
Qu'ils puissent faire leur deuil en silence

Hommage à Zyed et Bouna
Piégés dans c'bunker plein de Volts
On se révolte avec nos voix et nos cœurs
Trop d'rancœur que vos vies se finissent
Électrocutés, percutés par cette mort, pour rien
Une pensée, pour vous et les vôtres
D'en bas, malgré que du doigt on sera pointés
Toute l'équipe restera pointée, yeah

Face au danger, deux reufs nous ont quittés
Corps et conscience séparés, maintenant leurs âmes reposent en paix
Bondy Nord, Clichy-sous-Bois, on vient raviver les mémoires
So man, on vient donner un message d'espoir

Mon cœur s'embrase comme les voitures d'ma ville
Depuis l'drame où Zyed et Bouna ont perdu la vie
L'atmosphère est lourde, tout reste à éclaircir
La haine s'est épaissie et tout reste à reconstruire
J'ai mal au cœur pour ces deux vies brisées
La rage m'habite mais j'me dois d'la maîtriser
Dans c'vacarme, j'en appelle au calme
Pour Zyed et Bouna, je lâche une dernière larme

(OK, j'lâche une dernière larme)
Ces quelques lignes dédiées aux reufs, c'est la famille
Ce triste drame aurait choqué même les ennemis, l'ami
Paix à vos âmes
XXX, face à la mort, les hommes sont dépourvus
Le rap se mobilise, loin des idées préconçues

Beaucoup trop d'larmes de voir nos mères qui versent
Oh, plus d'âme, trop d'gens meurent pour rien
La violence nous inflige son venin
Regarde comment le monde devient
Nos quartiers brûlent
Trop d'nos frères et sœurs nous quittent
XXX changé, pourquoi tant de haine, tant de haine

Deux jeunes de mon quartier sont partis beaucoup trop tôt
Deux familles veuves, condoléances sur ce morceau
Bouna et Zyed, je me souviens de vous jouant au foot
Et sachez-le, si la France brûle ce n'est pas d'votre faute
À chaque décès on retrouve la même scène
Par des larmes et des pleurs, on espérait que tu reviennes
En vain, car nous savons que ce départ est sans retour
Alors on s'aperçoit que le temps nous est court

C'est difficile d'avoir des mots après un tel drame
On perd encore des frères et ça fait mal
Morts pour rien, Traoré et Benna
Une forte pensée pour eux, que leurs âmes reposent en paix
Faut qu'on s'mobilise
Du côté positif
ADM, Clichy-sous-Bois

La rue est nouée et seul Dieu tu peux louer
Car tous les scars-la doués devant les cieux finiront par échouer
D'après la Justice, on serait cloués sur l'bitume
Coupables de nos erreurs, c'est nos morts, il faudrait qu'on les assume
Est-ce l'erreur ou l'avenir qui est à nous?
J'présume que XXX t'enflamme, ces deux familles pleurent et prient à genoux
Sous l'œil du mal, on soutient seuls notre poutre
Mais c'qu'on trouvera jamais normal, c'est qu'les décès aux infos deviennent des scoops

Le soleil s'est couché, la nuit tombe
Deux étoiles naissent, le ciel est moins sombre
Mais ici-bas, votre présence n'est plus à cette heure
On lève la tête vers le ciel pour soulager la douleur
Traoré, Benna, reposez en paix, condoléances à la famille
Personne n'est préparé à ça
On n'comprend pas la vie, on la prend comme elle vient
Et c'est la mort qui survient, ça fait mal

Il suffit d'un rien, et l'corps est à terre, le cœur en peine, décor terre-à-terre
On XXX et on s'rappelle dès lors qu'la mort sème
À c'qui en font des prières, qui en sont témoins
À c'qui manquent à l'appel, morts pour rien
Dans la haine et l'sang, par faiblesse ou par besoin
Aux innocents tués par l'humain
Sans cesse on vit pour qu'vous soyez fiers
L'absence rend fort, laisse des vies dures comme pierre
Le vide à perte de vue
Si on s'en sort, on tient grâce au Tout-Puissant
À nos proches, à leur soutien

Mes paroles sont des chrysanthèmes sur vos tombes
Chez nous, quand il y a deuil, ça fait toujours salle comble
Mon peuple a toujours le choix entre la mort ou la honte dans c'monde
On doit être maudits comme Salman Rushdie
Beaucoup d'MC t'parlent d'espoir et de halls
Oublient les morts sur le parvis
Ces pères et ces mères qui dorment plus la nuit
On restera unis à toucher votre Paradis

Le feu et la guerre sont dans l'atmosphère
Le sang et le fer ont parfumé l'air
Woi woi woi c'est un hommage aux frères
Car pourquoi sont-ils au cimetière?
Le feu et la guerre sont dans l'atmosphère
Le sang et le fer ont parfumé l'air
Woi woi woi, la seule guerre à faire
C'est pour un changement sur Terre

Encore des larmes cette fois-ci car nos vies n'sont pas faciles
Mais si la paix nous fascine, pourquoi dans nos quartiers on l'assassine?
On a des racines et des ailes, on n'est pas des machines en diesel
On cherche juste un signe dans le désert
Dieu nous préserve car nos vies sont menottées
Que le mauvais œil crève, c'est le deuil dans ma communauté
Le 27 octobre 2005, deux enfants sont partis
Ça aurait pu être les vôtres, mais c'est les nôtres

La vie c'est pas une récréation
J'garde foi en Allah car c'est l'auteur d'notre création
Face à c'sujet j'n'ai pas d'inspiration
Ça mène à rien d'voir les gens s'prendre supérieurs à nous
Sache qu'dans c'monde, tous les êtres sont égaux
Comme XXX j'ai plus de haine que d'peine
Quand j'vois la loi, faite pour vous mes frères
Jusqu'à la mort, Zyed et Bouna
Que Dieu guide vos pas, Allah y rahmou
Pour la famille des deux victimes, jusqu'à Marseille on pense à vous

Dis-moi qui dira quelques mots en leur mémoire
Qui fera vivre leur souvenir, qui racontera leur histoire?
Qui parlera d'ces blessures qui n'passent pas avec le temps?
Qui parlera d'Bouna, Zyed et tous nos absents?
C'est un hommage aux familles frappées par le mauvais sort
Hommage à ceux qui pleurent auprès des corps, puissiez-vous rester forts
Année après année, ça change rien, on s'souvient
Bouna, Zyed, tous ceux qui sont morts pour rien

Hommage à Zyed
Et Bouna
Vos visages sont gravés dans nos mémoires

Écoute, le sol tremble
Car les genoux de deux familles touchent le sol donc le sol tremble
J'ai vu des jeunes frappés par la foudre donc les quartiers tremblent
J'ai vu des jeunes se serrer les coudes donc la France tremble
Zyed et Bouna, deux frères qui n'sont pas morts pour rien
L'heure est à l'hommage car en 91 c'était le mien
J'dirai aux gens d'arrêter d'parler et d'agir
J'dirai aux mecs de quartiers d'arrêter d'agir et d'parler

Zyed, Bouna, reposez en paix
Muhittin, tiens bon
Aujourd'hui, demain, pour toujours
On est avec toi

C'monde un casse-tête empli d'amertume
J'immortalise sur huit mesures ma compassion envers nos victimes
Vous laissez derrière vous un truc froid, un silence pesant
Auprès d'ceux qui vous aiment, tous vos gars (tous vos gars)
Et qu'la force soit en eux, ils n'vous oublient pas
Qu'la paix soit sur vos familles, frères Zyed et Bouna
Mère et père prient en direction d'Makka
Le cœur rempli d'amour, que Dieu veille sur vous, Inch'Allah

On foule le bitume, une marche en silence
Par respect pour ceux qui sont morts, reposez en paix
La tristesse est partout, on est tous concernés
C'qui est arrivé à Zyed et Bouna pouvait nous arriver à nous aussi, tu sais
On s'considère comme des frères, on a bouffé la même merde
La misère nous rapproche
La douleur nous dévore comme des chacals féroces
Et pourtant, c'était que des gosses

Je garde mon sang-froid face au regard de ces mômes sans espoir
Aux histoires dérisoires sur le trottoir
Je porte le bandeau blanc sur ma peau noire
XXX à leur mémoire, pas le choix, comme des proies
Traqués dans les quartiers, Zyed, Bouna
Leur vie partie en fumée
Consumée comme ces vers versés sur ma feuille morte
D'automne monotone à la veille de cet hiver

C'est avec beaucoup d'tristesse que j'suis venu rendre hommage
À deux refrés, Bouna et Zyed, qui nous ont prématurément quittés
En attendant l'autopsie du drame
C'est vrai qu'des voitures ont brûlé mais elles n'ont pas su faire sécher nos larmes
On garde une forte pensée pour toi Muhittin, seul rescapé
Et on prie fort que nos deux défunts reposent en paix
Sachez qu'ici on pense toujours à vous
Et on espère aller au Paradis pour s'retrouver près d'vous

Une touche d'espoir pour effacer les larmes
Un peu d'paix pour réchauffer vos âmes
À jamais graver dans nos cœurs ce drame
J'ai la chair de poule quand j'en parle, le cœur qui s'emballe
Affecté par le destin qui parfois fait mal (ça fait mal)
Une montée d'adrénaline qui m'branche, donc j'mets sur lignes
En écrivant j'rends hommage à nos frères et victimes
Que Dieu vous protège, Amine, veille sur vous, Amine
Nos pensées volent vers vous, Amine

Pour Bouna et Zyed
Je prends ma plume en versant quelques larmes
Partageant la douleur
La souffrance des familles qui les pleurent
Comprendre ce qu'il s'est passé
Exposer la vérité au grand jour
Que ce fardeau soit moins lourd, oh yeah
Bouna et Zyed restent dans nos cœurs à tout jamais

Refaire les choses avec un morceau de rap
J'y crois autant que les problèmes viennent du Noir ou de l'Arabe
Moi je n'dis pas que la violence n'a rien résolu
Mais je n'dis pas qu'elle est la meilleure chose pour nos rues
Par les charters, les carcasses de nos pères
Arrivent en terre de France dans l'espoir de se refaire
S'ils répondent à nos frères avec des cars de police
Moi j'réagis avec la voix et le poing d'Angela Davis

Clichy-sous-Bois, une centrale, deux morts
Des parents à genoux et le cœur plein d'remords
Zyed et Bouna, morts pour rien
Les cocktails Molotov brûlent pour rien
Le bonheur s'en est allé sans prévenir
Comme si dans nos quartiers on souffrait pas l'martyre
Deux âmes avec les larmes on les voit partir
On s'mobilise pour que nos p'tits reufs puissent s'en sortir

Comment veux-tu que l'on s'apaise quand sans raison les flics agressent
Et que les larmes de nos mères nous noient dans la tristesse
Haine et rage remontent à la surface de nos tess
Appel de détresse, SOS
L'État français brûle à force de jouer avec la braise
Solidaires de Clichy au Treize
Quand les p'tits frères partent avant leurs dents de sagesse
Excuse-moi d'avoir cramé ta caisse
Dur de me calmer quand les nerfs se manifestent

La violence règne pendant qu'les cœurs saignent
Pendant qu'les mêmes tiennent les rênes
Alors on s'entraide entre frères pour qu'nos larmes tiennent
Jusqu'ici, toujours au calme
Donc j'suis venu rendre hommage à mes re-frés, j'verse une larme pour deux âmes

Un problème dans tous les blocs et le feu attire les sirènes
Je verse une larme de vie qui stoppe la rage sous toute haine
Et c'est la mort qui anime l'effort des bouteilles
C'est triste mec, les médias déforment tout c'est moi qui l'rappelle

Nous on s'tient tous les coudes
Dans nos banlieues, toutes les larmes coulent
On est venus pour rendre hommage, rangez les cagoules
Ça pète dans tous les blocs, à qui la faute? (on s'en fout)
Cessez c'vacarme, ça ramènera pas nos potes
Le paradis pour eux (9-1), un drame
Le paradis pour eux (9-3), le paradis pour eux des larmes
Le paradis pour eux (tous mes blocs), le paradis pour eux du calme
Le paradis pour eux (9-1)
Le paradis pour eux (9-3)

J'passe le bonjour à la vie, le salam à vos âmes
C'était écrit, oui ce drame était programmé
J'passe le bonjour aux familles, dur de sécher ses larmes
Messieurs-Dames, le 27/10 deux fleurs ont fané
La peur a frappé, le malin nous a charmé
Trop tard, caisses cramées mais le cœur a un cocard
Jeunes de tier-quar, partis trop tôt
Il ne reste qu'un morceau en votre mémoire et quelques photos

Liberté, égalité, mais la réalité
Nous fait comprendre qu'on restera des êtres à boycotter
Attendre qu'il y ait mort d'homme pour s'faire entendre
Ou qu'nos quartiers finissent en cendres mec, c'est triste à dire
Aussi vrai que Zyed et Bouna resteront dans nos souvenirs
Soutenir les familles dans la douleur
Et aussi toutes les victimes de tragédies dues à la couleur
Mais pour l'heure on s'doit de rester unis
Munis d'espoir pour que les choses changent
Équilibrer la balance parce qu'on en connaît les conséquences

On a du mal à comprendre lorsque deux frères partent bêtement
Comme dirait Boussole, de janvier à décembre c'est la merde, peu importe le temps
Nos peines sont lourdes, dans nos écrits ça s'ressent
On vit tous la même rage à des degrés différents
Y a ceux qui ont la force, tiennent, et ceux qui tombent
Mes frères, mes sœurs, tenez l'coup, sur nous Allah veille du berceau à la tombe

Encore un drame, des faits qui s'multiplient
Qu'ce soit à Fos, Dammarie ou Clichy, walay c'est honteux
Bouna et Zyad s'envolent alors qu'ils avaient toute la vie devant eux
C'est triste, les meilleurs partent les premiers, ça m'dégoûte
Morts pour rien, alors qu'c'était deux bons p'tits sur le droit chemin
Jamais en marge, aujourd'hui j'vous rends cet hommage
En pensant à vous les gars, ces quelques lyrics, c'est pour la famille et les amis

Deux lanternes de plus se sont éteintes dans mon ghetto
Des larmes coulent à flots quand l'soleil se couche tôt
Y a-t-il une vie après la mort? Car ici la vie n'est plus la même
Sans vous, pour combler le vide laissé dans nos halls
P'tit frère, tué pour cette nation l'martyr est un soldat inconnu
XXX
Nous on n'oubliera pas l'nom de nos martyrs

Mais pourquoi la vie a pris des enfants?
Ça fait mal au cœur de milliers de gens
Pensons à l'avenir, allons de l'avant
En chacun de nous il y a un enfant

Bouna d'la PAMA, Zyed de Rabelais
Reposez en paix, et un respect à vos milles-fa

Pas la foi en peau d'requin, j'prie Allah au préalable
Un bleu à l'âme, blâmable
Trop pressé, XXX
Depuis la mort d'ces deux jeunes aimables
Le ghetto est inflammable
Faut ramener la paix pour Zyed et Bouna
La dounia nous induit en erreur
Hamdek, après la vie c'est bouillant
Une dou3a pour nos deux khouyas
Que Dieu préserve votre aura
Donne à votre famille du courage

J'ai contenu ma peine, j'ai réfléchi
Mes genoux se sont fléchi, j'ai prié, ma haine s'est rétrécie
La peine d'une perte d'être chers
Quel que soit son âge rassemble et unit tous mes confrères
Il suffit d'un drame pour faire tomber les a priori comme un château d'cartes
Issus d'la banlieue ou d'Montmartre
On décrit des situations existentielles
Afin que Bouna et Zyed le ressentent jusqu'au ciel

La France a eu peur de nos quartiers
Ton quartier, mon quartier, 91 les Tarterêts
Solidaires à Clichy-sous-Bois
On porte le deuil comme la famille de ces deux p'tits
Moi j'demande juste une seconde de silence, sans bruit

Aucune réglementation
Aucune personne en mission
Aucune réglementation
Aucune personne en mission

Voici un de ces félidés sauvages comme au CJD
Dans la rue, y a qu'des vénères, t'as pas idée
Maintenant j'suis père et en aucun cas
J'imagine même pas le pire pour mes youths ou mes brozas
Mon nom n'est pas important, mes phases sont pas importantes
Tant qu'on s'active et qu'on reste pas dans l'attente
Les larmes sont-elles nécessaires à cet instant
Les sujets sont-ils victimes de votre temps?

XXX 
Si la douleur noyait nos âmes
Si les pleurs nous arrachaient nos dernières armes
Si l'on avait  pris la vie de nos enfants
XXX 
Si la douleur noyait nos âmes
Si les pleurs nous arrachaient nos dernières armes
Si l'on avait  pris la vie de vos enfants
Qu'en serait-il, qu'en serait-il?

C'est jour de deuil et ma plume a mis son plus beau costume
Non pas pour du rap, mais pour rendre un hommage posthume
Depuis votre départ, deux étoiles de plus illuminent le ciel
Reposez en paix, Bouna et Zyed
Puissent mes paroles atteindre les cœurs de pierre
Atténuer les cris, les pleurs, accompagner les prières
Y a rien de pire sur terre que de perdre un être cher
Pour un père, une mère, que de voir partir la chair de sa chair

L'EDF s'éteint, deux édifices s'écroulent
L'IDF s'enflamme et moi j'ai plus les idées fixes
À la date du 27/10, amer est l'goût d'la datte
Pour les familles du CP, d'la PAMA
Les Traoré perdent un frère, l'UFC une star
XXX ton diams brille à présent dans l'ciel
Bouna, petit, tu vas manquer à l'Grand-pa
Famille et respect
Repose en paix

Parce que des frères sont partis, revendications partout
Malgré la haine, moi pour la paix j'suis partant
Morts pour rien man, va leur dire qu'c'est plus possible
Ici les frères s'unissent et la justice est prise pour cible
L'Afrique, l'Asie, ça concerne même l'Europe
Pour ces enfants, contre ces fous, s'insurge le rap
Solidaires, pour cet hommage on est en nombre
On détruit nos quartiers, laissant la haine sur les décombres

Un hommage, Masta, avant qu'la rage bouffe les cœurs
Pour toi ça c'est huit mesures, non pour moi un bouquet d'fleurs
La mort, tout l'monde redoute cette heure
Leur vie valait bien mieux qu'la une des newspapers
Ça pète à l'Est, à l'Ouest, au Sud, au Nord
C'est leur veillée d'prière qu'on honore sur un ceau-mor
S'recueillir, eh ouais c'est ça l'esprit street
Zyed et Bouna, morts pour rien yo rest in peace

J'ai d'la compassion, le cœur éploré
Pour les milles-fa, Zyed Benna, Traoré Bouna
Morts pour un rien, pour ça que
Pour sa sœur, y a plus d'p'tit frère c'est pour ça que
Pour ses parents y a plus d'amour c'est pour ça que
Deux jeunes décédés, à terre
Le lendemain, absents à l'école
J'sens l'vide dans l'décor, dans la cour
Les sentiments pèsent encore, pas d'réconfort

XXX attendons que la justice ka faire XXX
Mais si zot' partis
XXX et la cité une réunie
Vous êtes morts pour rien
Mais la cité XXX espère un plus beau lendemain
La paix et l'respect
Sont des mots d'ordre qu'on s'est donnés afin qu'à jamais vous brillez

À qui la faute si la France pleure des larmes de feu?
À qui la faute si le cœur des miens se durcit
À qui la faute si j'ai plus foi en rien
Aujourd'hui c'est ton p'tit reuf mais demain c'est p't-être le mien
J'ai grave la haine mais j'te l'jure que j'prends sur moi
Dans le béton, vos noms sont gravés, croyez-moi
Ici c'est JB Wash, j'te jure c'est auch
Reposez en paix, mais vous n'êtes pas morts pour rien

Le dounia, même si c'est vrai qu'on vit dans l'faux
Le draham au cœur me pousse à aller au feu
Une vie d'femme, une vie d'tess, une vie d'fou
Même le sheitan en vitesse nous veut tous
C'est le créateur que les uns criaient
Faut pas que je plie, j'ai trop de péchés
Faut-il se dépêcher pour pas que le mal puisse nous cracher
Dessus, Zyed et Bouna j'ai du respect malgré ce décès
Qu'on est déçus, pour la famille repose en paix

Alors c'est toi qui brûles des caisses et qui fous la merde
Celui hier encore qui embrassait le front d'sa mère
Le feu n'ramène personne, il noircit nos cités-dortoirs
Les flammes ne laissent que des cendres de nos mémoires
Ces hommages récurrents pour nos morts et leurs parents
J'aimerais n'pas les écrire, causer d'amour plus souvent
Maintenant c'est toi qu'écris mes textes, c'est toi qui tiens mon Bic
C'est toi qui mixes, c'est toi qui peux changer mon disque

Encore deux fins tragiques qui laissent un goût amer
Et des journalistes qui s'amènent comme des mouches à merde
Eh ouais c'est moche à dire, ils jouent nos vies comme des jetons au poker
L'insécurité comme joker
Tu veux savoir pourquoi ça crame, parce que dans nos rues pour rien ça cane
Et c'est les familles des victimes qui rappellent au calme
Quand les dossiers s'entassent et qu'les hommes d'État se taisent
Attendent que la tension s'apaise

Je pense à vos familles, la peine dans l'cœur
Tous réunis sur ce même son par la même douleur
Avec tout ça, tous les esprits se lassent
Dépression sous pression, c'est tous les quartiers qui s'embrasent
Pour rien, vous êtes partis en guise de sacrifice, pour rien
D'autres faits-divers emplissent les statistiques, pour rien
Zyed, Bouna, vous nous avez quittés
En quelques mots c'est dur, reposez en paix

Tous unis mais nos regards sont éparpillés
Que faire à part prier, crier qu'le destin est le pire des meurtriers
Cortège de textes tristes, de cœurs meurtris
Car la peine se partage, la mort est venue faire sa perquise
À ton avis, pourquoi d'l'amertume dans mes propos grave vides
C'est parce qu'il y a des morts pour rien en photographie
Familles Benna et Traoré, votre courage est XXX
Que des dou3as et des cierges pour les p'tits Bouna et Zyed

Deux pour l'prix d'un départ trop lourd
Une tragédie de plus qui pèse sur les consciences, un handicap de parcours
Dites-moi c'est quoi les dièses?
C'est vrai qu'ça brule chez nous mais on peut pas rester insensible
Quelle est la solution pour vous?
On une pensée pour les frères, t'sais pas comment ça fait tièp
Arrêtez la démagogie, on a d'jà perdu Bouna et Zyed
On vous demande pas de l'aide
Stoppez l'hémorragie, elle nous donne la gerbe
Enfin, qu'les p'tits frères partent en paix
Car nous ici on refuse de perdre

Ceci est un SOS d'une jeunesse noyée dans le deuil
Peace à tous les anges de là où le diable nous accueille
La France est sous les flammes causées par leurs provocations
Bilan, deux innocents dans l'électrocution
Mes condoléances à toutes les familles, d'ici ou du bled
Les familles des deux p'tits frères Bouna et Zyed
C'est Lorenzo, avec ma voix en guise de rose
Posée sur vos cercueils, mais on sait d'où vient la cause

Y a des choses pour lesquelles j'lutte, c'est ces gamins qu'on bute
C'est l'futur de la France qu'on décime d'un uppercut
Moi c'matin j'ai pris une baffe en allumant ma télé
J'pense à ces familles en pleurs, au destin qu'j'vais insulter
Bouna on s'reverra, Zyed on n't'oublie pas
J'déplore cette occasion où j'peux m'adresser à vous
J'rêve d'réincarnation et d'un monde un peu moins fou
Mais avant c'est pour vos mères qu'nous on ira jusqu'au bout

Triste constat, puisque ça reste constant
Ils rêveraient qu'on s'tue entre nous, au final qu'on s'plante
T'sais, la mort a frappé une fois d'plus sans raison
La banlieue a craqué, fallait qu'ça résonne
Zyed et Bouna, comme un symbole
De quartiers atteints d'tumeur, soignés au Synthol
Au flash-ball et au manque de respect
Génération cramée, ta jeunesse désespère

Sauvons les deux âmes
Comment résister, honorer son charme
Zyed et Bouna
Nous restons sans voix
Quelle choc de ne plus vous revoir
Sur mon visage ne cessent de couler les larmes
Que Dieu vous garde pour l'éternité

Une rivière de larmes coule sur la mémoire d'ces deux petits
Ils sont partis avec la quinzaine et cette triste envie d'grandir
Comment vivre sans s'dire qu'on aimerait combattre le temps
Que nos larmes sont constantes et qu'on aimerait comprendre
C'est vingt-mille watts qui foncent dans le grief
Vingt-mille batt', deux cœurs qui ne battent plus
Il reste que deux familles sous la pluie
Je pense à vous et sur mes yeux qu'on est tous là
Morts pour rien, jeudi 27, Zyed et Bouna

Certains songent à la douleur, d'autres pleurent
Et moi c'que j'aime c'est prendre mon stylo, écrire des mots en pensant à mes potos
Zyed, toi qui étais toujours là pour toi, pour moi, pour nous
Tu avais du respect pour tous
Tu m'as quitté en l'espace de dix minutes et voilà là où on en est
À la base on était dix le jour de cette poursuite
J'me suis fait prendre, vous avez couru et le soir j'apprends la suite
Zyed, Bouna, à jamais gravé dans ma mémoire

Ces deux jeunes étaient mes p'tits frères, ou bien auraient pu l'être
C'qu'explique pourquoi j'refuse que l'histoire s'répète
Dites-moi lesquels, toujours les mêmes dans c'putain d'drame
La vérité c'est qu'un problème se cache dans chaque voiture qui crame
Ma couleur m'empêche pas d'voir les différences
Pas les mêmes chances, l'seul droit d'certains c'est d'souffrir en silence
Mais j'garde le poing levé et une force pour les familles
Traoré, Benna, mes condoléances en quelques lignes

Nos jours sont comptés d'avance, gamin
La vie un examen, la mort ouvre les yeux et nous fait marcher main dans la main
Hier vous nous écoutiez, représentiez
Aujourd'hui absents, soldats d'infortune, reposez en paix
Ma dure génération a l'cœur triste et plein d'révolte
L'esprit en paix, on est venus partager la peine des vôtres
Promis, on tiendra debout, Bouna et Zyed
La rue se souviendra d'vous, toujours là sans y être

On veut savoir ce qu'il s'est passé
On veut nous cacher la vérité
Toute une communauté sous haute tension
Deux vies gâchées sans explication
Une famille perd son enfant
Impossible d'oublier, même avec le temps
Bouna, Zyed, paix à vos âmes, paix à vos âmes
Oh, paix à vos âmes, oh yeah
Bouna, Zyed, qu'est-ce qui s'est passé?
Bouna, Zyed, paix à vos âmes"

It ended in the fire that started with a look

You could have shot me, baby, shot me with a gun

(A hooded one:) ""It has twelve planets and its position is I/IV/V""
(Cendor:) ""Perfect! Of course we will have to wait several circles
If we want also to transport matter from Ahrem, in order
To implant it on its system
However this is not our prime concern for the time being""
Indeed the need for drastic measures was eminent
Time was running out, and the people knew it
Their number was growing beyond control
This once vast place was overpopulated
The ethereal dome was not visible anymore from
The surface of the planet. The shape of the stars
Was in disguise, distorted from the billions of lights
That were beamed from the flying architectonic mazes
There, in close orbit, were the quarters of the elite
Hovering on the waves of their poisonous gas clouds
A lot of suggestions were expressed on the last 100 circles
Almost all, concerned the colonisation of the nearest planets
But there was a big problem to solve. The inhabitants of
Ahrem were not completely autonomous entities
But body parts of the planet. In a sense They, were the planet!
Any attempt to send away the secure perimeter a sole organism
Would mean its certain death
As the accident in Ambere revealed, there were also some
Other suggestions for the problem, less complicated...
But they didn't worked out as planed. Then came Cendor
With a more ethical and discreet solution
(Cendor:) ""Let's send them there, on the blue planet""!"

Agnus dei, agnus dei, agnus dei, agnus dei

Because of his avarice, and his betrayal of the emperor's trust, Pier della Vigna was disgraced, blinded, and imprisoned. Dante's pilgrim finds Pier della Vigna on the seventh level of the Inferno. Like Judas Iscariot, he died by hanging. But Judas and Pier della Vigna are linked in Dante by the avarice he saw in them. In fact avarice and hanging are linked in the medieval mind
Now this is the earliest known depiction of the Crucifixion, carved on an ivory box in Gaul, about A.D. 400. It includes the death by hanging of Judas, his face upturned to the branch that suspends him. Here he is again on the doors of the Benevento cathedral, hanging. This time with his bowels falling out
Now on this plate from the fifteenth-century edition of the Inferno Pier della Vigna's body hangs from a bleeding tree. I will not belabour the obvious parallel with Judas Iscariot, but Dante Alighieri needed no drawn illustration: It is his genius to make Pier della Vigna, now in Hell, speak in strained hisses and coughing sibilants as though he is hanging still
Come l'altre verrem per nostre spoglie
Ma non però ch'alcuna sen rivesta
Ché non è giusto aver ciò ch'om si toglie
Qui le trascineremo, e per la mesta
Selva saranno i nostri corpi appesi
Ciascuno al prun de l'ombra sua molesta

And I say - may this pitiful soil rumble
Across vast badlands of red dust and cracking invisible being sore
From me one monument of destruction to another
And beneath every mountain lies one forgotten demon, still weary and yet enraged
Thus on the seventh day, the planet shall have realined
And the thirsting sun shall have cast the last beam of light
Darkness arise!
And around a throne of land, we shall unite to stay
Man, woman, child and beast - listen
And inherit my infinite wisdom for I am all and I am no one
I'm visible and yet unseen
Beyond the stars that lie beyond, my empire does stand
Far away and hidden well from the jealous eyes of all
I call the three dimensions mine
And to the blackest day has come
The infinite fire shall be led from your fearful souls
I have come to proclaim oblivion and all the flames

Man, I had to

I came up and did what I had to
I got a big bag and I'm glad too
I flooded my wrist 'cause I had to
I fuck on that bitch 'cause I had to
I fell out of love cause I had to
That pussy all dried like a capsule
I got up and dipped 'cause I had to
I pulled up in that whip and I smashed through

Got me grippin' wood grain and I'm grapplin'

Avianne pierce, she thought I'm an athlete
Fuck your campaign and establishment
Mixed that champagne with the Act and then
Play with that sack and I'm sacrilegious
Can't fuck with you 'cause it's bad for business
I see through you like a broken window
Fake friends trying to hide their true intentions
Take a risk, I'm addicted to gamblin'

Hit that ho like a cymbal, no talisman
Pardon me for all the manic-ness
Blame it on chemical balances
My bitch she resembles some actresses
I do what I want, I don't ask for shit
I'm speaking in codes, using acronyms
My haters salty, they got sodium
I'm stretching bread like an accordion
Handle each situation accordingly
Look up and deal with what's in the front of me
My man was just write up disorderly
Give my manager 40, he better not be ornery
Used to have strippers supporting me
Then I carried the weight, now I'm portaging
I just put on my city and represented
And I did my thing, and you irrelevant
No weather, you out of your element
Broke 'cause you mainly a resident
I pull up with cuties, no vixens on me
Used to cop two nicks, now it's zippers only
I been makin' money since like six this morning
Lit up all the trees like it's Christmas morning
Used to smoke a stick of mid-level
All these circumstances circumstantial
I just stuck to the fundamentals
I'm 'bout them bands, no One Direction
Married the money, no matrimony
Left that bitch alone with no alimony
Ate the pussy, tasted like some calamari
Party pack is lookin' like a bag of Smarties
Fine tuned and I'm razor sharp
And I'm drippin', I'm drippin' like Glacier Park
Water on me like the coast guard
Keep my boys afloat like Noah's Ark
Your shit is stepped on like a soldier mark
Then I ripped off my lick and I overcharge
Presidential ho, a Amy Klobuchar
She fucked her friends, man, with no regard
The bitch is gon' do what she had to
I will not tolerate attitude
I woke up my mama, I told her I love her
And stay thankful, mom's gratitude
I mix up the Henny and apple juice
Jealous of me, I'm not mad at you
'Cause now I can do what I wanna do
I came up and did what I had to do

I came up and did what I had to

Lightly off, barely escaping polio

Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And if it's cold outside show the world the warmth of your smile
But more than anything
More than anything
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I can almost see it, that dream I'm dreaming
There's a voice inside my head saying ""You'll never reach it""
But I, I gotta keep tryin'
Gotta keep my head held high
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things too
Yeah, this is my wish
Hope when you take that jump you don't feel the fall
Hope when the water rises, you built a wall
I hope when the crowd screams out, it's screaming your name
Hope if everybody runs, you stay
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what is waitin' on the other side
I...I did it all
I...
I hope you dance (My wish for you)
I hope you dance (It's the climb)
I hope you dance (And I...)

Consumed,Slambo,consumed,slambo,fear,"Slouched in his throne, consumed with disarray
He raises his blade and fixes his gaze
Upon the illusion it displays
The glow of a wretched disastrous fate
Overcoming all life and all of existence
Detailed images of catastrophes and fallen kin
A whole world swallowed into nothing
Locked in terror, he misplaced the courage to stare any longer
He throws aside the blade
From its handle, a parchment emerges
He summons forth
What appears to be a letter inscribed in blood
For the cursed one
To fulfill his birth right
This message appears to be from his former master
Detailing his life and a fate so tragic
Bound to a demonic entity
The sacrifice of his life
A necessity
The key to defeating the beast
That is tethered to you
Resides within your name
""My dear Velos, you must challenge the void""
Let no cost be to great
Do as thou will no matter the consequence
Festering in hatred
Violently searching for a way to free himself
In desperation, he uncovers the words that he seeks
""Requiem mundi!""
Sensing he's not alone, he proceeds to the palace balcony
Reaches into the night and commands
""You will reveal yourself!""
Emerging from the darkness with a cold grin
The king begins to shout to the cosmos
The brightest flash the night has ever known
Encased the world
The ground begins to shake and cracks appear to rend the earth
Bask in the light of the ancient one
His own legions are burned in the light
Then the darkness engulfs the sky, an endless night
We are one
Seamlessly, the augury is carved in stone
A devoured sun
As the sun succumbs to the black hole
Perceived as created erroneously
Galaxies start to collide and debris showers the world
A coldness sweeps over the land
As time and space are misconstrued
Those who survived have now died in an instant infinity
Surveying chaos that has stemmed from his own hand
All of existence deconstructed by the void
Perplexed by destiny, he stares into himself
A realization of a forgotten future's past
Engorged on greed"

The Warmth,Slambo,the warmth,slambo,fear,"A Hymn of God's Words
The Symbolic Meaning of God's Wrath
God's expression of His wrath
Is a symbol that
All hostile forces will be destroyed
All evils will perish
This is the uniqueness
Of God's righteousness and His wrath
This is the uniqueness
Of God's righteousness and His wrath
When God's dignity and holiness
Are being challenged
When just forces are obstructed
Unseen by man
This is when God will send forth His wrath
This is when God will send forth His wrath
Because of God's substance
All forces on earth which contest
Oppose Him are evil, unjust
All of them come from Satan
Belong to Satan
Since God is just, of light, and holy
So all things evil, corrupt
Belonging to Satan
Will vanish from here
This will happen
When God sends forth His wrath
This will happen
When God sends forth His wrath
All evil forces will be stopped
When God sends forth His wrath
All sins harming man will be stopped
When God sends forth His wrath
All hostile forces will be known
Separated and cursed
Satan's helpers punished, rooted out
When God sends forth His wrath
And God's work proceeds with no obstacles
His management plan develops
One step at a time to His schedule
This is after God sends forth His wrath
His chosen people free from
Satan's disturbance and deceit
His followers enjoy His supply
In a place of peace
This is after God sends forth His wrath
This is after God sends forth His wrath
God's wrath is a safeguard
Preventing evil forces
Multiplying and running rampant
God's wrath is a safeguard
Protecting the existence
Of all just and positive things
God's wrath is a safeguard
Guarding what's just and positive
From suppression and from subversion
From ""God Himself, the Unique II""

Reaping the rewards of the fable you'd been sowing
I saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs
Like Caesar crossed the Rubicon you seemed to walk on air

Yea I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page
Your songs have all the hooks
You're seven wonders rolled in one
You shifted gear to cruise
Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes

Oh the bellboys are crying and moneys changing hands

Insane act of bestiality
Unhealthy sex between the mares of Magnesia and Centauros
He arose from Ixion's fictitious mating
Royal dauphin of Lapithes people
And Nephelee, a cloud of the effigy of Hera created by Zeus
Sacrilege in this desire
Bestiality in this insane act
And now you are coming
So strange and furious monsters
Providers of panic
Servitors of cruelty... cruelty!
Oh powerful centaurs!
Beings with human chests and horse bodies
Your force is so colossal
Your customs are so brutal
Oh great centaurs!
Cruel and mean creatures
Hungry for flesh and blood
Fearsome enemies of mortals
Bringers of disorder!
Gathered together in a ferocious pack
Living in mountains and forests
On mount Pelion, in ancient Thessalia
Your life is just violence and debauchery
Raping... Brutalizing...
Equine man, human horse
Your wrong doing know no limits
Even during Pirithoos' wedding feast
Ixion's descendant, King of Lapithies
Belong against his will to you
Prisoner of irrevocable past chains
You turn night into chaos
Eurytion your chief
Gorged of good meats and delicious wines
Totally drunk!
Try to rape Hippodamie
The Greek king's magnificent wife
The noise of swords taken out of their sheaths
Resonates against this unacceptable attack
Man's victory is total
Eurytion forced to run away
Centaurs pushed back forever
Explosive... Is the fray!
Colossal... Is the strike!
Bloody... Is the massacre!

Hey look kids you need to change your tune
That avenue you traveling unraveling soon
You'll be battling doom but does it matter to you
Worried bout who was laughing at you
Your appearance is more important then whats really real cause here it is
Situation's bad not meaning good
A lot be in the hood that got me with nowhere to put
My trust in no discussion
Spontaneous combustion
Lust and greed if you ain't up to speed
You's a duck in need
Cats ain't got enough to eat
So there's bluffs and beef
Chicks up the street
That tricks come to see guns under the sheets
Shells pummel your meat
Forgetting former, still
Dude you're sorta chill sitting on bout 40 mill
But his whole quart'll get spilled
Over those sort of deals
That get you sorta killed or up in court looking for appeals

Cause the world's gone bad we've lost the love we had

So cold I have to go
So down I need to go
So cold as I go

You don't know who I am
Last week you was acting like you was my man
But you wasn't hey
Served you're purpose dog
At the end of the day
Is it worth it all
Immersed in all the worth the world got to offer
But perpetrating proper like, uh, nothing can stop ya
Can't even trust my doctor she in it for profit
And everybody looking for some kind of prophet
Situation mad toxic my man got hit
Cause the bird he was with wouldn't stop squawking
She juggling five cats and they all lost in
The illusion of love that she used for profit
The usual topics: chickens and benjamins
You supposed to be my kin Mexican or Asian, European or Korean or Jamaican
Makes no difference
Our existence is still shared between us in essence

Yes the world's gone bad we've lost the love we had
Take me away
Cause the world's gone bad we've lost the love we had
Show some love for your brothers and sisters
Show some love for the whole wide world
Show some love for your enemies and frenemies
Show some love for the rejects on the street
Show some love for the whole wide world
Cause the world's gone bad we've lost the love we had

If the world is bad refer to your dad
And his before four score what's the reason he's sore for
Karma is real part of the deal when's how you started the deal
Cause everything is 360
It will start the cartwheel and snowballs so don't forget now cause I told y'all
Dead the hate cause all it do is hold y'all captive
All in the world you're trapped in
Relapsing you can't feel what's happening
I deal with facts man
I was at the crossroads dealing with lost souls that couldn't cross though
Lost hope off dope
Out to jostle
Any unweary traveler that would fall for the talk show
It's foul how they play it
But you can't stray to show love take
Courage and strength and realize we ain't sure as we think you know

The worlds gone bad we've lost the love we had
Take me away
Yes the world's gone bad we've lost the love we had

So down I want to go
So cold I have to go

I heard a man once say
If you're prone to flights of fancy
Your dreams can fly away
See the sights around you
Of breakdown and decay
Wrought by the greed for a better life
For which you have to pay
Well you dance before the storm
And don't look back to where you've been
The horizon's getting further
As the sands of time run thin
Well you dance before the storm
As the machinery breaks down
You watch the sky go black with anger
No one makes a sound
From Glasgow town to London
Down the motorways
There's people standing in the rain
Looking for any way
To take them down to where they're bound
It's all part of another way
It's called the art of survival
In a modern age
Well you dance before the storm
And don't look back to where you've been
The horizon's getting further
As the sands of time run thin
Well you dance before the storm
As the machinery breaks down
You watch the sky go black with anger
No one makes a sound
From Albion Hill to the Old Chain Pier
You can hear a person say
Spare some change for all me pains
The world has gone astray
Down the road another flat got burnt
Where a friend of mine once stayed
So another squat in Brighton
Needs to hide another head
And if your head spins round, go underground
Away from the games they play
There's people down there who are trying to care
Let each one have their say
It's not revolution tactics
It's not cause for anarchy
Just a natural fight for a natural life
Of which the systems are afraid
And if it all surrounds you
Seems like there's no escape
And there's people stood in front of you
Saying do it in their way
But turn your eyes towards the tides
And see how they never change
The sands of time will break their minds
Just like riding on a wave
Well you dance before the storm
And don't look back to where you've been
The horizon's getting further
As the sands of time run thin
Well you dance before the storm
As the machinery breaks down
You watch the sky go black with anger
No one makes a sound
Well you dance before the storm
And don't look back to where you've been
The horizon's getting further
As the sands of time run thin
You dance before the storm
As the machinery breaks down

You're a star with three faces
You like reading on Sundays
You like writing in the week
Listen to music until you weep
But when you start to day dream
Your mind goes straight back to music
Like the three faces of the moon

Sometimes I look at you and I look into your eyes
I notice the way you think about music with a
Smile, curved lips you just can't disguise
But you think to be king, is it making your
Life worthwhile, why is it so hard for you to
Decide, which you love more? To be you or to be king?
Like the three faces of the moon

You like to use the words like ""To be king""
You like to use the words like ""To be at top""
You like to use the words like ""Being free""
But when alone your mind turns straight
Back to music, that's where your free
Like the three faces of the moon

Sometimes I look at you and I look into your eyes
I notice the way you think about music with a
Smile, curved lips you just can't disguise
But you think to be king, is it making your
Life worthwhile, why is it so hard for you to
Decide, which you love more? To be you or to be king?
Like the three faces of the moon

You like to hangout and read with Namjoon
You like to kick back and write with J-hope
You like to stare at Jin and his bad jokes
You like to envy the strength and vitality of Jungkook
You like to see the brightness intensify in V
You like to watch skillful clumsiness of Jimin
But when left alone and encircle by people
Your three faces is same the moon's, but your
Manic mind goes straight back to music
Like three faces of the moon

Sometimes I look at you and I look into your eyes
I notice the way you think about music with a
Smile, curved lips you just can't disguise
But you think to be king, is it making your
Life worthwhile, why is it so hard for you to
Decide, which you love more?, To be you or To be king
Like the three faces of the moon

You're not fond of Alone, you really know and hate pain
But when those three faces of the moon rise
Just think back to music with a smile
Let the light of the moon protect you, guide you
To be king you need you're friends and there own
Three faces of the moon

Sometimes I look at you and I look into your eyes
I notice the way you think about music with a
Smile, curved lips you just can't disguise
But you think to be king, is it making your
Life worthwhile, why is it so hard for you to
Decide, which you love more? To be you or to be king?

Is a love such as that which I exhibit for my practice
The factor which then amalgamates debates with straight-jackets and robes
Huddled in brackets that blacken the average globe
Xenophobe, loathe to modify the fly, feel this
I carve a notch in my wall for every stall
Every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall
Drunky peasants, honor the shifty Megatron presence
Slug a bolt once ceremonies of merit turn bloodsport (Uh)
Voted hella high seas, I freeze your mega dumb company
Pumping out wise beads like, plot sneak-attacks on dry leaves, dunce
Crooked rumors turn zoomers when rookies talkin'
Bad seeds blossom the Wookiee walk; harken
Let a sucker drift, I lift up every stone prone to find
The point at which repellent signals ultimately bind
When a pack of style mimics see my brains target the cluster
I advance clutchin' the mic like bully to knuckle duster
And ascend; your riddles yield a little plastic blend
Fuck a badge, light a bonfire dancin' jig around the pig
Figurin' yeah, I'll land a plane on bleached-stained trackers
Usin' only the finest and post-modern terrain mappers
Once my brethren disperse
My god, you think the heavens touched the earth then
Thirstin' a perch on a bursted curse, but I don't; confide: wine and water chose me
Bored: lasso down Polaris, let the glow amuse me

Ok, I lay me down to sleep, creepin' a slumber under red skies
Heads splittin', straight sippin' a drip of dead vibes
It's red tides from here, stop and smell analog hell
Clenchin' a stench of burnin' logics and a child with yearning optics

Now someone's approached the road, shaken like snow-globes
Other sought safety in numbers, other's flows got towed under (Yeah)
Still another took a turn and crashed and burned while others flee
But there will never be another starvin' marvel like me
See, there's a time when rhyme and
Paint combined can't even manage to tell what the swell is like
Picture your imagery embellished
With the hellish aspects of the swarms' forlorn facets
Soul crafted fat cats, burrowin', left perennial tenants discouraged in
Discussin' my four seasons flourishing, uh!
Searching, perching, poetic lead poison
Poised in ploys to leak a little bit of moisture on your pride
I'm a animated style machine intervening faulty production
Fueled by nicotine suction
From ducks in my carnival to vipers in my garden
You flash identify by them genus, species and class
Start to chuckle, buckle the architecture til it fell through
Kill the survivors then raise the dead for shock value
By the time the pending settlement's fully negotiated (Yeah, I'll...)
I'll have put aside a few to get myself situated

So like sadly, my style spooks juveniles like Boo Radley
Radically weak assume the colonel Kurtz in our platoon soon enough
That's one bluff call, toughens the searcher
Stuttering, emerging, gutter urchin, bursting

I live for the moment of truth when Big Willie rapper
Acknowledges failure and states ""Goddamn my shit is trash
It's time to let go!"" Tin man banging upon his chest to hear the echo
Heartless, kid, hollow compartments
See we the people of the united, starving artistic
Militia keep movin' in order to form a more perfect union
I'm clued into the poison panoramics brewed in panic situations
It fucks a little with my brittle gift
I tell myself ""Stay up high
Make a mockery of sun and moon and star 'till they hand over the sky""
My deluxe's fluxes pivots to where the crux is
Invade the town while village elders holler ""Who the fuck's this?""
See: hipper cats aggravated, trudge through the muds
Quicken ones, plots thicken like coagulatin' blood
Rugged serpentine climb, pebble to rock
Let your pretty pink cloud nine expectations please you not
I'm, Ae-*fucking*-sop Rock, mic bizarro
Proper application of the soul by my standard
Candid once position from which instigations spawn
And man, I plan to die with a mic in my hand, it's like...

Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope, it's like
Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope..."

(There is no guilt and there is no shame)
A moon piece to fetch up the golden cup
A snow piece to avoid the great heat of the sun
Is kept in the night and by the light of the moon
An ice piece so as they seem forever fallen
A night piece of the dismal supper and strange entertainment
A rare chance piece, a handsome piece of deformity
The skin of a snake bred out of the spinal marrow of a man
With stones and illegible inscriptions found about great ruins
Pictures of three remarkable steeples or towers
Built purposely awry, so as they seem eternally tipping and falling
A transcendent perfume made of the richest odorates
Kept in a box of translucent scale
A glass of spirits made of ethereal salt, hermetically sealed up
Kept continually in quicksilver, of so volatile a nature
That it will scarcely endure the light
And therefore only shown in winter
Or by the light of a carbuncle or a firefly
And batwings
And batwings
And batwings sing this limnal hymn
A wideness opening and closing
To keep the darkness sealed within
To keep the darkness sealed within
To keep the darkness sealed within
To keep the darkness sealed within
A moon-piece to fetch up the golden cup"

Que cruje de tristeza y por no llorar serrín
Vas tocando el violín
Una canción de fondo
Recuerda temas hondos
De una noche de abril
Juntos los dos volando
Y el cielo improvisando
Colores y estrellas
Dos copas y unas velas
Y cada diecinueve de febrero
Te canto al mundo entero
Por ser lo que más quiero
Y corres y avanzas a todos lados
Lo nuestro no es pecado
Y se llama obsesión
Sin ni una condición
Cógeme de la mano
Y finge ser mi voz
Azótame al corazón
Y aunque tengas razón
Promete no soltarme
Ante la tentación o las adversidades
Y finge ser mi voz
Y siente mi pasión

You dealing with stock owners, conversation with stockbrokers
Make a call for coco, smokin' dope from my crop grower
The block know us, kush got a funky sock odor
How could you not notice? I come from that rock culture (Rock)
Star of the squad but they cannot coach (At all)
Louis Vuitton holster, this for my niggas in the cell
And on they wall, they got a Nicki Minaj poster
The talk's over, no drive-by's, we walked over

COB bandana tied to the end of the AR
Iller than they are, rhymes so sick, give 'em the day off
This is the chaos, Nicolas Cage, face off
The Dark Knight, I make it a dark night when I'm gettin' that K off
Better than whoever done it, even officers better run it
With the drum, I got a technique that'll give twelve a hundred
Now the tables turn, to whom it may concern
I used to control more shooters than David Stern
With Lucifer, hater, burn

Yo, I was in the park spray-painting on the platform
Patent leather top ten, Space Invader hats on
Eighty-something, I've been a threat for that long
Where a lot of people get poked up and clapped on
My job really putting on for the city
You get popped like a wheelie for saying some old silly shit
Tell me it'll be safer to say it in Swahili
They be wheeling you away if you say it in South Philly

Dutch lit, nuts big as shit, taste the rainbow (Ayo, yo!)
Put your paper up and threaten shit
Or tie something up, send some messages

Ayo, ayo, I used to tell a maid, ""Sunny side up""
Basement, a chainsaw, money tied up
Paper bag over his head, so  let the crocs out
Wave a whole chicken by his legs near the croc's mouth
Sweating bullets in the tip, blow torching his flesh
I seen his face melt, drip gooey shit on his chest
Watch this motherfucker beg for mercy
Shoulda let his wiz suck my dick for that time he jerked me

The soldier I rolls with the coldest clique
Call me prototype, never had a mold to fit
My clothes is dipped, my bros is lit

Better get in line, I chop the bass like I'm pitching dimes

All by myself, I'm 100 deep

I was on the first 50, now the powers at a dollar
Politician pushing tracks in it, mayor, I president in it
'Til it's humbling, think you grounded and get punished
This the second time Slay needed my two cents to keep it a hundred
How you want it? Fake and be a martyr for this matrix?
They gon turn up the AC then charge you for the blankets
Lux verse mean, got you stuck standing there
Like you at a stop sign waiting for it to turn green, what you mean?

My soul is never for sale
My youngin' just did a twelve, he home, he ringing bells
Wish him well, me and mines on different times
Decline from nigga crimes, I'm fine just spitting rhymes
Read the signs, body language is loud
Cowards hang with the crowd, I ain't never changing my style
Then and now, before that was all that
Fall back, official is what you call that

I be that Third Coast legend, Dirty South icon
Shuttin' shit down, soon as they cut my mic on
From the first bar down to the last syllable
Niggas that thought they were immortal find out they killable
Once I see blood, I'm like a Great White
Catch you slippin' on a late night and it's no bark, straight bite
Watch you bleed out as reality starts to sink in
You tried the Triple OG (Bitch) what was you thinking?

I give the coke to your crew, the butter's crazy
Fallopian tube, just cut it, baby
Gordo butterfly collar cover the Cubans
She need pads like Ewing, I hope you know what you doin' (Look)

Slay got me Shade 45 Sirius
Gold frame shades 45, Siri

I used to be up in a tunnel like a hundred deep
Screamin', ""Nine Trey, Su-Woo"" with a bunch of B's
Never tied up shoes, but every night we would run the streets
Nigga, fuck growlin', it was nights I heard my stomach speak
Then I started pumpin' that bass like they done a beat
Never let shit slide 'cause they might think somethin' sweet
Nigga, it's July, shots get hot like summer heat
When I pop up, niggas turn vegan, they never wanted beef

I know these streets with my eyes closed, so my worst fear is to die slow
Lie low, 'cause in '05 you flipped to Five-O
And I know, 'cause if Alpo did it to Rich
For some bricks, word to Flex, he had no reason to lie, po'
Aight though, we ain't gotta dwell on the past
Devilish laugh, arrow spins I'm ahead of the crash
Better to clash, when you handle your beef, settle it fast
Metal and mask but still keep an elegant class

Who the greatest all time? Where them niggas reside?
I seen all fifty names, man them niggas done lied
I take the first forty-eight, make them niggas retire
Last two we could joust, make them niggas my squad
Fuck them, let's see how the ladies fare
Swerve on these bitches like I'm settin' my baby hair
They feel a type way, but they never gon' take it there
They tryna keep it cute 'cause they know that it's safer there
They wouldn't dare

I can't explain what I dealt with
Know it was all weak and creep and stealth shit
When I come from under the belt with a metal shit
Forever Brownsville, numb, I never felt shit (You're as cold as ice)
I still got that real world charm, nigga, be alarmed
Body armor on, warmer in my palm (NYC)
Where you get the storm before the calm
(M.O.P.) OG and we treat it like Vietnam

My generation drank forty ounces of Old English to ease the pain
Y'all niggas drink White Claws, nigga, we ain't the same (Kahm-kahm)
It's curfew whenever I come through (Kahm-kahm)
Kill the fuckery, them niggas can't fuck with me (Come on!)
I'm really 'bout it in the war
Taxiderm' your bitch head, mount it on the wall (It's M.O.)
Throw it up, nigga, we stand tall (It's M.O.)
You know what the fuck we stand for, it's M.O

Too many niggas in here, but never follow the script
It's movie time, release the clip and have 'em doin' a flip
Off-white Virgil, need a whip with the interior Crip
On any given goal to slide, nigga, minus the slip
Checkin' niggas outta line, like it ain't nothin' to skip
Step in my section trying to flex and end up gettin' you stripped
Too many niggas watered down, might go to sinking they ship
And if it's beef, I come to trip, I never pull up and dip
It's Precious season, nigga

Walkin' in the storm, my face had the hatred in it
Mons had the colorful money with the staples in it
Grew up street and I stay committed (Yeah)
Movin' white back and forth over green like table tennis
Guap was pourin' in, my Glock was roarin'
At nineteen, shots hit you like hydroxychloroquine
I'm still forty with the forty close
In the 840 playin' new E-40 with some horny hoes

(Yeah) Finally, y'all been waiting
To hear a verse for the economy stimulation
With Bible verses forsaken and tribal authorization
We marchin' as we awaken the mobsters across the nation
Ask doubles next to ride
The show gun with Shogun to testify
Fasho son, we hold somethin' that electrifies
N-1 L-B, no one left behind, pause it

Where I grew up in the world of Pop to give you the shot
When I vodka, the Glocka blocka! and blew the dot
You want attention? I'll give you the spot
And run up on your favorite artist aimin' at him, like, ""Do the drop""
I smack the cobble out a gobblin' blogger
Togglin' robbers with my saliva as hot as a pot of lava
And guapa, my mob has been on the sly since Yo Gabba Gabba
Trying to get the drop guava, interior baklava

Straight out the Bronx, straight off the fall
Straight off the motherfucking claw for who's settin' it off
Blocks where they spark a lot, click with the Glock a lot
Catch you at the parking lot, park you in your parking spot
Niggas know it's sex money, flex money, they do a lot
What's better than more letters and buddha spots?
Buck fifties for niggas that don't do a lot
Go ahead and get your shooter, get your shooter shot

Shaq Dies', front if you want
Flow through the spirit of Kobe, I don't puff on no blunts
My estate got a shuttle, you punks
Funny thing I got places in my place I ain't discover in months (Months)
I naturally hover above 'em, I'm Kal-El
Touchdown in the arena, the crowd yell
And if they want beef, I'm ringing the cowbell
This crispy cream make 'em ring like they found Mel

Jones, and I don't need no introduction
I'm the best, pound for pound, it's no discussion
Seen some mass destruction, this how I leave niggas area
Me, Shaq and Gunz, nothin' scarier
A nightmare on Elm Street when I hit the booth
A motivational speaker when I spit the truth
Come down to Pensacola if you need some proof
I could mess your smile up like a missin' tooth
Ahead of my time, but still in a league of my own
I tried to quit, but they just won't leave me alone
If you ain't got the right price, stop callin' my phone
M-mister, y'all must've forgot the king of the throne

Aw man! Ayo, Kay!
Ayo, what up, Red Alert?
I don't think they ready for this
Well, they better tool up 'cause I ain't done!

When you hear the shots
I'm not documenting, I'm 2Pac-umenting
I'm one of the Beatles, how I'm whippin' from that Lennon
Bye-bye, hater, real niggas winning
The 4th of July don't tell me I'm independent (Nah!)
I'm killing it, bro, my motive locomotive
Zero to ninety-nine like my Netflix loaded (Get em'!)
Telling your boss Brick City boys is fire
Never mind, half of y'all be talking through the wire

Media slandered me, so that's why I'm slayin' you niggas
Never knew what hit him, got the doctor X-rayin' you niggas
Turned you to a victim, man, I sprinkle some yay' on you niggas
They thinkin' it's drug-related, gotta weigh on you niggas
All on the radio with the beef, got 'em sweatin' like they was Keith
And it's never gonna be peace, I'm shooting up your album release
Baggin' bricks with your niece, come and get you a piece
I'm taking responsibility for the murder increase, it's Buck

Kay wanted me to be one of the buck because I been a buck
Back when a pack of Newports was a buck, I was a young buck
On the corner of Monarch, kids from Far Rock hoppin' over the turnstile
To set up shop up top by the Jamaican spot
My joints have been a bop, from vinyl, cassettes, CD's and streams
On every Martin Luther Boulevard, they payin' homage to the shooter from Queens
Right now you wanna be this cracker from Queens
Fact though, I'm covered from special fleece to my Wallaby Supremes

This one image is unblemished without one gimmick
Your line of scrimmage, I cross it in one sentence
The core writer for those that lost sight
Of the promenade, now heed the words of the poor righteous
That build with mathematics for those whose path is empty
But y'all know math was in me for the past half a century
Now do the knowledge how the real writers do it
'Cause I want the smoke, charcoal, and lighter fluid

Talk shit, but I could back up game
The way you silly motherfuckers on the mic talk the same old same
How you wouldn't hesitate to kill, buck, rack, attack
Ask him if he said to Shan, he said, ""FUCK THAT!""
Bullshit, I'm not the one to get with
Pressure gets so violent, givin' a fuck what I hit
I play your songs like a lullaby that put me to sleep
And I sing it like a pussy that's this deep

KRS is big and scary
I'm that legend, getting cream, legendary
Hear me, I rocked this, shocked this, hip-hop this
I woke and I wake up, these rappers are not this
The hotness, I would knock some of these rappers out
But you can hear they already unconscious
I got this, on the top list, fake, I'm not this
Temple of Hip-Hop, rising to the top, kid

Every verse is a persecution, it's murder music
You get cursed, the room is like army, they get the hearses movin'
Fire shit, you get burned and ruined, it's burnin' fuses
Bunch of designer, heard a human loses, deserve these bruises (Go)
Nobody tellin' me that it could ever be somebody better
I got a vendetta, I mean every word, every letter
Ahead of my time and you know not to ever put me in position
Designed to put these rappers out of commission
All I spit is dope and after this, y'all gon' need intervention
Taking it back to that driving ambition

Look up to Twista how I be killing 'em like I'm in Wimbledon
I make a sweep when I'm doing the murdering
I put the cinnamon up in the pendulum
Minimum damage I would never do, I dead 'em like a barbiturates
Omnivorous with the flow, it don't matter which bar I bit you with
I could reorganize the confusion of a child Pharaoh
Now munch on that food for thought from a piss poor pimp from the ghetto
Hmm, I am approaching so I hope you're using a radar
Causing beautiful chaos in this unusual séance

Itchy trigger finger, watch me finger fuck it, niggas bust and
Squeeze the biscuit, hit him in his English muffin, repercussion
Call the homies, niggas spray the corner, now they fallin'
On the white sheet and bars, drag rappers by they wife beater
Drama King told me ""Drag, go stupid,"" so I'mma go stupid
Made this fitted cap a drop top, almost Mini Couped it
Stick shift, automatic, automatic big clip, round clip
Hit a nigga while I downshift, yeah

It's me again, all I be is when, never if
If you see a lens, it's probably CNN or a gif
I could rat-a-tatter, your brain matter get scattered
And served up on a platter, they call it data, baiting cappers
I'm more like Beta Kappa, I'm great like your great great grandma
And they wanna protect with this Great Lake grammar
It's Rivers, that's why I gotta be called, decide if you fall
Or have to wear a thought or break a side of the law
And fight for yours

We a hundred deep, don't give a fuck 'bout your capacity
They tell me who they favorite, I ain't hatin' but they trash to me
Y'all know this my world so I'ma hold it down like gravity
I'm bitin', that's a casualty, I'm blowin' out your cavities
Keep a pocket rocket for the people pocket watchin'
Pull up with a Glock and cock it, got you beggin' not to pop it
Y'all gotta stop, I want more cash and more fast
I went on a run like I'm all gas from all bad

You're dealing with a locksmith, my mindset is too meticulous
Rhymes melt when I sing like the wings from Kid Icarus
Every rap is indicative, diction is like a diction
I'm ditching that status quo to inhabit flows that I stitched in
You're pitching garbage, each comment is like a gauntlet
A conscious effort to execute rappers that try to test it
Ingest them and exit through my excrement through my intestine
Intestinal fortitude afforded you is what you left with

I don't smoke but stay with a cig like Mary-Kate Olsen
'Cause my patience short as D Brees or DeRozan
I ain't a Fashion Nova model that swallow rappers for follows
Just for mentions on blogs with flaws like it's Apollo
But keep the toolie, pockets blue like Tookie, patience short as Uzi
You a groupie, you a rat like Mickey, you look like a goofy
Out your kufi, yeah, you out your top, thinkin' you gon' move me
You like Sookie, you suck dick for chips, I'm too rich and choosy, bitch

I ain't gotta tell you what I've done, who I am or where I'm from
If you don't know it by now then you just dumb
I ain't got no pistols, inf' beams, choppers or no Dracos
No car, no girlie, beams or no bankrolls
I buy shares, land, LLC's and payrolls
Kuwaiti and Bahraini dinar, gold bouillon
Mutual funds, nigga, fuck a dollar and a peso
I got seven investors that'll invest when I say so

Hey yo, max eight lines, I wrote this spinning a yarn though
Foul mind, the villainous Queens, Lance Feurtado
Mean face Murcielago, over god flows
Salute that, shit on schedule like it's Jumu'ah
I don't do the work, I just stuff bags to pass shooters
Let the foreign skirt, squeeze semi and let it squirt
All the facts, all the chow now, getting rich off of merch
Laser beams, I done turn niggas' Foamposites to red bottoms

Yeah, I'm underrated and I never sold my soul
And I never switched slang to sound Southern when the game changed
Niggas say they real, 'til you see 'em on the real
Then you find out they a bitch ass nigga, just with a record deal
For real, the internet gon' get these niggas killed
Hide behind that keyboard cuz, gon' make some blood spill
Your insecurity gon' make this .45 open up your mind and bring enlightenment
And then you'll have more clarity

If I roll a hundred deep, it's two hundred fists, two hundred feet
At least a hundred guns so every nigga get one a piece
Bitch, I'll piss on the tombstone you underneath
This sick, don't play this shit if your stomach weak
I can stomach beef, I done faced danger
I squeeze like a waist trainer then you will lose stomach meat
I run the streets, so when Cass scheme, that mean
They gotta get shot like a mandatory vaccine

Out of sight, out of mind, 'til I creep up behind
Double barrel shots you out, everything on your mind
Figure that, like the next line you tryna consider
But you careful so you dumb down, you ain't no spitter
Then you post, you got beef, tell me you ain't no hitter
You a tweeter, who mouth flame more than his heater
From the days of the park jams, blowin' the tweeters
Rugged raps with a DJ cut in the meetings

G-G-Get 'em!
Let me give you facts, before CashApp
I was frontin' niggas workin', they was bringing cash back
Before Instagram was selling up instant grams
Connect 'em and I can never fuck with no middle man
Before the fake jewelry and niggas with all the cappin'
40 karats in my Philly, this nigga was all platinum
Huh? You little niggas in the way
This million dollar payday's me and my nigga Kay Slay

It's the West Coastin', New Yorkin', low-ridin', Crip-walkin' nigga
Anyone can get it, masked like the pandemic
Niggas mad I don't pick up, I got multiple phones
Slay took a month to find me, got multiple homes
Pop off, my black talons will bullet your vest
(Gun noises) 300 blackout, fully suppressed
Cut through your cold crew like a saw blade
Then up at Mr. Chow's eatin' sauté

Jersey Journal, where the next signal infernal
And eat chicken with friction before I try 'em, kidnap the colonel
Trigger title, trigger finger, trigger treacherous
Double shots of extortion, exercise to an exorcist
Exercise my freedom, beat 'em when I leave 'em, eat 'em
Even when the odds ain't even, I get even
With Kay Slay, fuck they play, the rebirth and replay
Mr. Slap-Your-Favorite-DJ, this all has changed on eBay
It's Jers'!

Top billing how we Gizmo and Milk shit
Grimy crimies, did all the dirt and the filth with
Yeah, my young buck days was on the real strip
Fillmore Slim shit, straight off a film strip
I ran through more fine women than Wilt did
Superstars, chem fills bitches with some soft and silk lips
Made a killing off of dealing that real fix
Numbers like a pinball wizard, tilly-tilt shit

I'm the product of Frank White
Whoever acting tough gets stage frights
Getting clearer visions of grave sights
So get my cake right, something in the bake and it ain't light
Or something in your face and it ain't life
So don't play with me, Hell gates await
When I come to the 8th, I shoot it faithfully
And tell Mitch to pray for me
Slay with the AK, nigga, that's my speciality
Brooklyn forever, M.A.F.I.A. 'til the death of me

Look, for my next verse I done left Earth
The internet done triple my net worth off a sweatshirt
Expert, I let the TEC's work, your neck chirp
Been a devil, bench press metal, I'm doin' chest work
One of the deepest, see you've been warned
Please believe you're now lookin' at Jesus in human form
I'm Jet Li, respect me like you speakin' to Scooter Braun
The newest legend in the league, I lead with my shootin' arm
It's PAYNE

All you assholes finished, I don't have those limits
You'll get this work in all black, it's a black-owned business
But you cats don't get it, that's why I'm stunting on you newbies
Your father was a super fan, your mother was a groupie
That's why I trip like, ""Who you tryna rap with?""
Sounding nothing like yourself, who you tryna catfish?
Like you bodied that shit, shut your lying ass lips
Do I look like I been playing nigga? Colin Kaepernick, motherfucker

You got the memo, murder game is my M.O. (Fact though)
Lurk the frontline, not from out of the window (No!)
Take a life, then take your jewels for a memento
You make it to the outro, you got to pay for the intro
Like a nympho, ain't fuckin' around, I ain't (I'm not)
Shoota a sure shot, like a D in the paint
Don't need a long stick, just a .38, I'm straight
One dome shot, that's how I show restraint (Shoota!)

They like ""damn, we ain't heard from you in a minute""
Shit get great from my present, see, bitch, I'm gifted
They said it's only right they callin' me cold, see, I'm the sickest
I heard it just like Curse of the Lottery, you hoes is scripted
Don't get it twisted, me and you, what's the difference?
I'm a superstar, you role playin' bitches is pimpin'
Oh, and did I mention, keep me up out your mentions
You bitches ain't soldiers, y'all just be wantin' attention

Hey yo, New York, get the money, Five Boroughs of Death
My dude was called, where's the money, fire, birds and meth (Hey!)
Hood Bunny, Bugs Bunny, Iceberg, and Sweats
First baguettes, Big Stepper learn the steps
Earn respect with connects 'cause my word was kept (Yes!)
Swerve the 'Vette like Sean Paul for more medicine
Fur gon' slip, like I don't spit, burn the blessed
The truth, 2Pac jewels like I serve them wet
Vado!

This homicide was prophesized before I was a toddler's size
Any job nigga, I am overqualified
I'm the kind of nigga whose cloth it be hard to find
Integrity? I put mine over dollar signs
A nigga play me, then he out his mind
As long as my niggas is winnin', I ain't gotta shine
If you can't see I'm a G, then you kinda blind
Die 'fore you disrespect me, nigga, bottom line

Return of the barbaric barbarian bar spitter
Bar 9 bar guns ballin' like Bar Mitzvah
You bar 9, your bars done, I'm Barific
My bars gifted, real rapper, my bars Christmas
Cooked like a bar & grill, I spit these bars in your grill
Homer bluehead keep a mag, I'm Bart Simpson
My bars mention muscle bars, I'm bar benchin'
Ted Danson have a beer and cheer these bars pimpin'

I see these niggas flex as if I ain't one of the best at this
And wonder why I'm attacking the mic like a pessimist
My name should be next to excellence, bless the globe
With the pestilence, like methodin', and put in work like a Mexican
A record for killin' tracks, somethin' like John Gotti
What he have, like 19? I just caught 99 bodies
Slay, I'm sorry, I know this hip-hop camaraderie
But since nobody bodied me, don't accept my apology

Stop chasing props, niggas, top niggas march
By the cops, followed hot blocks, they pop niggas
I ain't one of you niggas, I'm a pair of Gators
You a pair of UGG's, you ugly but you comfortable, nigga
I'm the OG, pre-Cardi nigga, the diamond in the back
Cadillac black, Pretty Ricky, Maserati nigga
The god-body, rock a party nigga
That can socially distance your head from your motherfucking body, nigga

I'm so Bronx, nigga, my middle name is Jonas
BX microphonist, also known as
The Bronx bomber, comma, hip-hop's Barack Obama
Osama, Dalai Lama, either way gon' be some drama
I'm the one even your momma fall for
I'm droppin' the bat and take it first, nigga, ball four
I'm roundin' the bases while niggas trip over they shoelaces
With they screwfaces, mic broke in two places

100 deep, know how we roll
Find where a nigga sleep, blowing out peepholes
Nothing never been sweet but we icy cold
Put a price on niggas' head for that shit you said
Got back so we boomerang, watch what you say
Hot shit'll spray, in a box you will lay
Know the Mobb be the gang with the Drama King
Always gonna hold it down, that's what I promised P

I did it, y'all forgot, I'm still with the scripture
Every bar has a plot and these lines are configurate
The mind over mine over mind over the pendant
I am signing on the plot, I will put 'em in the blender
A dope spitter with a pro-black agenda
Supported by the black referendum
And this only a sliver of the splendor
Homie, it's the sensei
A dope boy with a flow no lo contendere

They told me pussy and paper go together like problems and pistols
I'm a problem to pussies who want to play with my issue
I'm pullin' rappers close, that shit you wrote was half-ass
I'm way past first class, laugh when your hearse pass
I Kill 'em with kindness, King EDI the highest
Me, Noble, Slay, you can see we the flyest
We load the spray, pussy niggas retire
100 deep, now you can watch us rise up

When 'Rock the Bells' dropped, I was locked into hip hop
Fresh off the porch with my brother Sean's boom box
Around the same time when I heard Illmatic
I was on my block, sellin' long dimes to the addicts, yeah
I remember back when Rae dropped the purple tape
We was young Outlawz, tryna raise the murder rate
Me against the world when I first heard Doggystyle
Still screamin' ""Fuck the world, doggystyle""

No more mumble rap, back to that Boom Bap
No cap, I'm in the trap where the goons at
Peace to all my niggas up top, getting them lunes back
Salute to the brother of me and my nigga Loon back
Harlem World's finest, let's be honest
You don't gotta give me dap, nigga, just pay homage
Peep my steps, always keep the piece on deck
I'm from the danger zone where we handle beef by death, nigga

Everybody's an opp, plenty bodies'll drop
Slay hit me up, told me body the block
Go ape the whole eight, no way they hold weight
They so fake, okay? I won't play, ya don't say?
Kay shit, basic when they spit
Face it, we not only the zone, we the matrix
Your algorithm rhythm off balance
I'm 'bout to start the ""We don't care if you die"" challange

Live from the Wire but I reside in the A
You admire the attire, I am sighin' today
No Jaden but I'm Lord Raiden
Show you with all the cadence
Lightning in my tips, with these scripts, I'm full paid in
And what a great game in Heaven, boosted my cranium
Bars became za induced with titanium
Stars beyond Mars, the truth, I'm so empty
With six spliffs in the booth, it hits like Vibranium

Ayo, Kay Slay, we can't let the BS slide
The game ain't been the same since DS died
Got five niggas jumping out the GS5
Will leave my gun smoking like a PS5
DS5 the street rap, somebody tell me where the streets at
This that shit to make the heat clap
From my niggas selling cheap packs
Them niggas keep straps, the Onyx is the kings of that street rap

It is Sticky, don't make me put my hands on you
Nigga, I could tell you what each one of my fingers do
My pinky finger, that's with the pink ring at
And my ring finger, never put a ring on that
And my middle finger? That's how I feel about that
I use my index finger to make that thing clap
And my thumb, I ain't got a use for that
So I put it in a bitch ass while I fuck her from the back

What you lames claim is relevant ain't
The culture's five elements, felons pistol whip your pelican vapes
I shoulda named the metal Beretta the Drake
Givin' em back to back hits 'til your skeleton breaks
Yo, take a new era super head in my Wraith
Givin' me fitted, call it the 7 and 1-8
Each one of my bars smoke ya whole 16
How you trap in your mom's necklace and wear big jeans?

I ace the motherfuckin' track like a pro's supposed to
I'm blowin' up in this bitch, you know, Apollonia
And anytime I did a rhyme, I did it for the culture
The doctor said I need a culture, I might have the 'rona
I beat the shit and now I'm like a hundred times stronger
Run for the block and flippin' rocks to a stock holder
Hold my composure, bring my hand up when the shots over
A hundred deep with the soldiers, and we shoulder to shoulder

Yo, I live a DJ's dream, hearin' fans scream
Cash in my hand green, they wanted to ban me
'Cause most of it was tax free, at last, me and Slay connect
Niggas know the outcome
We got mixtapes with features better than your album
Bounce Master with the Street Sweeper
For you heat seekers and them double D cup ladies and IG divas
My mixtape gave your boyfriend power
Holla at me when y'all got my flowers (Bounce)

I'm Junior Reid, I run these streets
Killin' all these hip-hop beat
Hey, I just can't be defeat
One blood family, we came here to eat
Murder!
When I roll, you know I roll deep
My hand stay strong and you know we don't cheat
Trap for the money and you know we don't sleep

If it's beef and we don't make up after talkin'
It's a high chance you gon' be wearing makeup in the coffin
I think of Busta Rhymes the way that the cops flamin' us
Like ""put your hands where I can see before it get dangerous""
Fuck twelve and whoever gave 'em information
State property parties, you want a invitation?
You don't wanna do that, family
Them people gon' have to move your family, it ain't a movie, y'all

You woke up a sleeping giant, there's no one breathing this fire
It's me, I'm known globally mostly for being violent
I'm closing up both of your eyelids 'cause no one seeing me rhyming
Fuck quarantine, I'm outside, I'm a morbid beast on the mic
These are more than schemes that I'm writing
It's for the fiends and the piper
New cocoa leaf, it ain't Pyrex, hoping that they don't die next
Shoutout to Street Sweeper, I breathe ether, my team G'd up
The streets need us like cheap heaters and clean sneakers

Wais P, you should have gave me the whole song (Why?)
'Cause I'm doper than the shit Demi Lovato overdosed on
Put a hoe on every corner you post on, poison potion
Give you my life on every track that I spoke on
Blow bullets 'til the barrel is hot enough to cook coke on
Phasers photon, never on stun, give you the whole drum
Wanna know why I'm on the second run? I go dumb
Plus a hundred rounds beats fifty in any gun

I can spot the lies in they lines, what lines in they eyes
Is fear, you hear? A coward cries when he dies
I was down, now I'm up, they surprised by my rise
I've been out, fresh fade, bitches thought that I was Nas
Lord, please forgive me, I'm a sinner
Sweat suits, gold ropes swinging like a '80's dope dealer
Trust me, I get iller, underneath the chinchilla
The Street Sweeper, Kay Slay with a hundred killers

Always been disrespectful, never been polite
Slay got me on the record with a bunch of niggas I don't like (I really don't though)
Them niggas corny, and their verses is not hard
Probably like ten rappers on this record that I got robbed
I'm the truth, I'm just realizing my worth
Niggas gon' turn this shit off after they hear my verse (I don't blame 'em)
And fuck whoever feel disrespected
Niggas gon' be mad Kay Slay put me on this record (Ah)

The best ever, bulletproof, the vest leather
Head shot, talkin' big bags of cheddar
Harlem, we run shit, you fags sleep
Cemetery, last stop, your bag's deep
Six feet, gun and a mask, my team creep
Mausoleum, you can see 'em, your team's sleep
Harlem, mob style, we run shit
Sheet rock, bury niggas for dumb shit

Grenades, bombs and rocket launchers
The smell of dead bodies, the odor comes back to haunt ya
Gucci vests from Dapper Dan, mountains of blow on a glass table
Look like a goddamn avalanche
Construction bags of snow, one scale
One doctor just in case your blood pressure fail
We got diesel, weed, coke and lean by the pail
Two phones next to that old bitch out in Wales

Show a sign, force on the course, it's authentic
You cross the sauce, try to be boss, get lost in it
That's a early retirement, call it a forced finish
Fuck a Porsche with horse, I put your horse with Porsche in it
Nigga, Mike Cee, syllable, syllabicate
Syllabicate, it's so real, realize, realization
Realization, realize, real
S-Syllabicate, s-syllabicate, syllables, Mike Cee

I swear to God if I die tonight, I'm taking a few niggas with me
My little man just came home doing 5 so I gave him 50
I ain't gave his Dior back meaning I got this Llama with me
Run Scott my papers 50 sellin' bricks, I don't fuck with dizzies
Keep a lot of shooters outside, it's gon' be hard to clip me
Before I surrender to God and Mississippi
Got these bitches being my mule to get some bigger titties
Falling cost me 260, got another 60 with me

Fuck y'all, thought I better talk, caught up a narrative
I sat back watching you tryna figure what bag it is
Imagine if I came back, Super Lover with savages
And put a tilting was building change the average of marriages
'Cause she's still after me due to audio in audacity
For cardio and the tune grooving room at capacity
When parties over, we boom boom, for you it's gravity
A tragedy, by two masterpieces causing catastrophe

You could have a hundred verses from my hundred persons
But this one emerges
And it's curtains when you get to squirting on a piece of Birkin
Detroit is a mindset, as soon as the verse ends, you rewind it
Knowing that the Drama King was behind it
I'm Page Kennedy, don't let the last man escape
Get your ass kicked by a movie star that looks more like an asterisk
Get your bifocal lens
You a fighter that wouldn't even punch vocals in

I spit stupid, you just stupid
Don't even walk off your porch, you should just stoop it
You too bitch for this goon shit, it ain't just music
We shoot you and jam to your death, no Rick Rubin
Yo, my gun blow drumroll, 'til it unload
Or 'til the gun broke, then punch holes through a chump's soul
I'm muggin', it's just jokes, I'm friendly and shit
Get higher, it's the highway to Heaven, I'll send you a lift

(Gunplay) 7.62's, nigga never left clues
Crib looking like a motherfuckin' evidence room
And I keep a street sweeper, nothing less than this broom
And that's only when I'm in a fuckin' excellent mood
I got four nine-pieces on a four-door panel
Louis open-toed sandals, overdose on those samples
Living legend in the 'jects, nigga daddy every threat
Homie died in his holster, got the weapon, never left

The pandemic got niggas searching for endemic
You either win or you a dub, fuck the club, don't get it fucked up
It's still paid for the bin
And you just gotta find a fucking way in
Now we gonna see who's a boss
And rise above the COVID or take a fucking loss
Wear the mask or don't, I don't give a fuck
I'ma still get a buck and a gold medal, I will never settle

I be the block (dynamite) so hit the sheets to the streets
Like playing games with Jamar's will beat your feet
I'ma drop a straight 8 for my nigga Kay's beat
We go back like Fat Jack, my nigga, Harlem heat
Got bodies for a throttle smashing King Midas
Put the drip in the game, drop jewels and pop bottles
I'm valedictorian, ask any historian
I'm back from streets, you pullin' up in that DeLorean

I'ma keep the knowledge, yeah, two cyphers
(Keep it a hundred) Lord J and Kay Slay, that's two triflers
We roll deep when we hold heat
Stay away or get sprayed with a new virus
They manufactured a new crisis
With plans to capture your third iris
I stand with the stature of the bird ibis
I'm like Dawoodi when I'm doing my duty (Facts)

I'm from where Big and Hov' came, Pop Smoke cocaine
Rope slayin' over coats and them dope rope chains
Bed-Stuy Veteran fella been ridin'
Better than I've ever been America's bidin'
Harris no comparison since
So don't let that fly shit go to your head like Mike Pence
I got seniority, Francis Sorority
Sonja Blade, bitch, just respect my authority

Let's take it back to the essence where it all began (Yeah)
Hip-hop, the original man (C'mon)
First emcee ain't my claim to fame
'Cause I been getting money, ain't a damn thing changed
I'm Coke La Rock and I'm still on the scene (Let's go)
The true OG to the culture you're in (Okay)
Bronx legend, respect the crown
And pay homage where it started, we call it the Boogie Down

I'm from the era catching cabs on Broadway
Put 'em on hold, ride around town all day
Way before the Uber and a Lyft it was OJ
Do the kickstep, man, just like Kid Play
We're on the east side like DJ Kay Slay
Smoke your Chronic up, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre
Sprinkle my man, E-40, he from the Bay
Yo, I say butter man and you say Parkay

Smooth B kick shit Pelé like soccer
You that man in the middle, cockblocker
I been a G, never been a sucker
I don't hide, never scared, not a ducker
Above the Rim like I'm in Harlem at the Rucker
Motherfucker, I'm thorough with this
I ring bells around the world every borough with this

Always had the bands like Coi Leray
So I'm young enough to relate to the YouTubers
Old enough to still date a few cougars
Yet the struggle became a weapon for me
So success became a separate story
But them cheques, got 'em checkered for me
Shit, I'm shooting from Steph' territory
And I get more love than Diddy's license
We rollin' a hundred deep, and I'm the city's nicest

Look, I'm Tommy Egan in the Honda weaving
Leave your mama grieving for the non-believing
On the deacon, Dominican mommy ganja steaming
Bomb with demons that'll take your chain and go to pond to peacing
I quit trapping 'cause my music is dope
You might've saw me in the lane but I'm truly the goat
You try to tell him calm down, bro was doing the most
They left him in the hospital with a tube in his throat

I trap with the guys knowing I'ma capitalize
But slaps I'ma drive to DC those capital rides
Put rappin' aside I got yak and captions to buy
She smashin' up lines so big they look like capital I's
We back in the times so start us here you back in the pines
Snap but I'm fine the Henny and the gas intertwine
I smash and I grind got the work stashed with the 9
I'm where they'll put you on a shirt like a fashion design

Yo!
You from the hood Uptown Queens, New York
Save the milk cereal with the fork
Scraped the plate and now get the fuck out my way
We on the grind, yes, I got a lot on my mind
Back in the days, I used to wanna punch them in face
I changed my ways and now I just wanna get paid
Smoking haze out a trombone; Nicholas Cage
Fire tire is burning, times is turning

Kaflow Kaboom rolling a hundred deep
Ever since a young wolf, I always hunted sheep
I already killed all the wolves that wanted beef
Seen a nigga brains on the floor and it made ya stomach weak
I'm from the streets where they brag about puttin' you underneath
A lot of niggas gon' get shot before the summer reach
Take you to the balcony, hang you from your feet
My office hours are from nine to five, not from one to three

A living legend like Slay on The Box
The big dime baby, I'm like Jay to the opps
Purple Coogi Purple Tape, I'm like Rae to the opps
When it's time it ain't the mink then I'm playin' the fox
I'm sorry, king of these Pradas and not Adidas
NDF, we the mob and I'm the leader, free the opps
Fear the law, get money, and flee the cops
Fuck the judge, fuck the feds 'cause they the opps

Sickening, street smart but the flow ignorant
Henchmen, but never wear no Jimmy when I'm hittin' it
Big up to the game, bookstores, no more memberships
Shout out to the cub and Dior, free the innocent
Outlaw, live by often, I would die for
I get all the blame, someone get shot, they say it's my fault
So when they talk, I just pay 'em, never mind
'Cause when I spot 'em, I'ma dot 'em like the letter I

I'm Toussaint Louverture, unfamiliar? Google more
Gurkha out the humidor, wise man who fool 'em all
Prove 'em wrong, told Kay Slay I would do the song
Move along if you ain't about that communion, dawg
Through the fog and darkness, the world be in peril
'Til we expel the devils and renew the godly process
I'm blessed, not pressed but I'm vexed, the game culture
Brothers obeyin' other suckers who ain't of us
We reppin' that red, black and green, that's a thing
Like Pythagorean themes that put data in the machines
The latter means I saw a lot, Earth a tourist spot
Still we universal beings, this rehearsal VN
P.S., we turn T-shirts to tuxedos
With flowers from the mall with no GMO's or cheat codes
The power is in lovin' the death of your own ego
O.E. go, that's that Brooklyn

Who really the best rapper since Pun ain't here?
Y'all know the answer to that when Bamz in here
The most underrated, the most hated, the most doing the most
The most almost famous, the most favorite
Bodega getting them chips again, what happened?
First class back from Switzerland, no capping
I'm the voice they wanna silence, who said it's late?
It's perfect timing
Load up the UZI, headshot, take the diamond

In the car with 2 blicks, them shits got 3 attempts on it
You gon' be the first full body
Toe tag, zip 'em up, the doc won't stitch 'em up
Sucka ass niggas been lollipops
Spin the block twice won't leave 'til a body drop
My influence in the hood is impeccable
Stir fry something turn a nigga to a vegetable
*gunshot sounds*
Hello!

It's P dot T dot K, nigga
I'm back looking for drama, I'm here to slay niggas
NYC tryna be A niggas
Blatant only way you figured out to get paid, nigga
And let them niggas have they own style
And act like you niggas really from home
You know that where they shit was grown
And leave that drill shit alone too
Before the shot gets to drilling you
Nigga!

These rappers hoein' now, doin' anything to get papes
Even my DM's like a bitch to do a mixtape
I be killin' shit, I need a sponsorship from Ruger
Been ahead of my time, it's like I rhyme from the future
If niggas want trouble, homie, the trouble suit us
Ran up on you snakes, got me feeling like Medusa
They say they from the Bay, I'm nowhere specific
But those that don't know, nigga, it's a difference

It's getting real hard to eat, no time to argue
Blow a driveway through your chest, let it park you
The broads done rip apart you
Sunset dark you, leave you hard to recharge, it'll restart you
No cinema like our own theatre scarier
Big Dubez, King Kirk, Brando, three of the thieves
Period, lyricists, storytellin'
Cordelen, split your fuckin' watermelon

4D! I go up top, they take enough shots (Enough shots)
Now I'm home, we see what's up then (Home now)
Let you tell it, you Teddy Bruckshot
All I'm hearing is Teddy Ruxpin
Trust and believe, sleep on the D's
Get tough then, mics, I crush them
Causin' disruption, we talkin' a tusslin'
Figure four rap, nigga, fuck all the fussin'
End of discussion

I been livin' on the road for the past week (For real)
Makin' more moves than an athlete (Uh-huh)
I'm from the backstreets where they pack heat
I deliver, got more drop offs than a taxi
Hated by the ones who love, shit's weird
I been seein' six figures for like six years
Young boy goin' dumb and he 'bout to go dumber
Two sticks on him, he think he a drummer

A fist up for black people, our lives matter
Like your life, but my life, they won't understand it
Traumatic stress on my hands, this is from being captured
Mutilated like castration, part of them chapters
But this a never ending story, them pages continue
My shade part of that food chain minus the menu
It's deeply rooted in genetics, the past that we've been through
Original Hebrew, got me feelin' it's sacrificial

I got the power I'm putting in, punching the clock like the '99
'89 before that seventy-five
When I was around and I first rhymed
While many searched hard for punchlines
I had some that you cannot find
Had some that you can't rehearse
All I had to do was voice a verse, the Kay Slay show

Fuck chill, I think it's time that people really know
What's real, nobody else get to spin it
I know these haters won't condone, everything I own
Pointed at the throne, and I don't care who's sittin' in it
Bank on that, nobody son trust
After the clashes and the ashes come dust
You came for the fame, you gotta do what one must
But me, I'm only here to eradicate the unjust
Real talk, motherfuckers the worst
They ain't grow into fuck niggas, they were suckers from birth
Rub shoulders and then it's over, you touch 'em you cursed
I can't wait to put love in reverse
The verse woulda been iller if it wasn't for Slay
He said ""'Sau, it's for the culture, not today""
I said ""Cool, and usually you're always right
But just remember, culture vultures ain't always white""

DJ Kay Slay, The Drama King
Rolling 110 Deep
That's right!
It had to be done!
Everything revolves 360°
What comes around goes around
Bring it back to the talent over popularity
Start talkin' to the people
Instead of about the people
Don't test me
You fuck around next time
I do Rolling 200 Deep on you motherfuckers!"

‘Cause I’m too

I’m really feelin’ like the homie Rittz said it the best
Y’all thinkin’ that you’re different, but you’re same as the rest
You’re a mess, ‘causin’ stress for the best of the best
All them kids think you’re dope when you’re average at best
It’s a savage event when you’re trapped in the tent
And the animal’s outside, ‘bout to ravage your hеad
After that, you can never bе a maverick, you’re dead
It’s the end, do I gotta say again that “you’re dead?”
No more payin’ the rent and no more depression to vent
No more braggin’ ‘bout your swagger when them faggots around
No more laggin’ in a drag and no one’s sad that you’re passed
I’m finna light you up on fire ‘til your skinny jeans are fried
‘Til I go and take a piss in your snapback, it’s dry
And your Cadillac is mine, I got Aflac, it’s fine
Gave it to Mayhem, told him “go ‘head, drive!”
“Take it for a joyride, if you wreck, alright!”
Now follow me home, we finna rock with Jay Rock
With the awkwardest talk and got the flow of a hawk
I’m ‘bout to wash the game up with a smock and a mop
I’m the hip-hop cop they always talkin’ abot
Policin’ the beats like the streets if they knock
We gotta keep ‘em in stock like a box full of ganj
‘Til I’m at the top of my job with the Opera Doctor (Uh-huh!)
‘Til I bust on these duds with the God of Odd Chakras (Cha!)
You can bet your white or black ass that I will not stop
‘Til I’m a cloud of dust or I’m outlined in chalk

From now on, none of you motherfuckers are allowed to say “swag”
Only Lil B is allowed to say “swag”
Anyone else says it, I’ma fuckin’ hurt you!

Fuck swag, turn it off, man, we had enough
Swag, swag, YOLO, major label, one-hit wonder
We solo dolo, independent, underground thunder
Fuck swag, turn it off, man, we had enough

Flying soldiers wielding aimless daggers, swagger
Sell your weed and soul until your fame is all that matters
See it’s the same lame platter, fast, quick fixin’, no nutrition
Lickin’ on the same punchlines, a simpleton’s addiction
Our generation loves a limited edition
But can’t conjure up attention if the resistance depended on it
The beast has its mouth full but yields an empty stomach
Empty conscience, tries to pawn it, choking on its own acidic vomit
Tried to ponder and wander and wonder if hip-hop is a new rock’n’roll
About to be overrun by these punks, they locked in the hole
We put money in their wallets when they pickpocket the soul
And proceed to use ignorance to fuel the rocket they stole
Pseudo-intellectuals roam the planet in the year 2025
The Age of Information died long before the sirs and madams surmised
The destiny is a fallacy mobilized by superstition and lies
My stash has got the suggestion of a straight-edge plan
Just a double-edged sword held in the hand of an unspoken man

Fuck swagfags, they get teabagged
I don’t mean to brag, I spit hot slag and I throw it up, Ohio flag
I’m puttin’ rappers in body bags, they’re shitty, I need a doggy bag
I light my blunt then I take a drag
These swagfags more annoying than jetlag
I don’t need the beat to prove that I’m the dopest
But it helps suppress the mind like brain hypnosis
I’m ferocious, in doses, my flow sorta like Moses
You a fat fuck, whose got swag? Go munch on another Hostess
Cooties in the particles that I spit, that’s why I say “I’m the grossest”
They call me a “pot addict,” talkin’ shit from yo attic
I say “come face to face,” but you can’t face without a base to calm my acid
Why do you try? Why do you try?
All I hear is “Why? Why? Why? Why do I try?”
I’m independent, need no label, I’m a legend, you’re a fable
Put me in a mental hospital, my brain is so unstable
Dippin’ like a ladle after I choke you out with a cable (Cable!)

Like I’m drunk as a fuck and that clatterin’ bitch
That never shuts up when I’m handlin’ shit
You ain’t got swag, you just handlin’ shit
Fuck is this here? Just open your ears
And when I get near, you know that I’m here
Fuck Lil Wayne, fuck Drake and you too
Fuck Facebook and your feed and YouTube
“But Shirgrimm, why you gotta be so rude?”
Shut the fuck up, just be glad it ain’t you
Don’t know what the fuck I been through

Baritone:
Bugles sang, saddening the evening air;
And bugles answered, sorrowful to hear
Voices of boys were by the river-side
Sleep mothered them; and left the twilight sad
The shadow of the morrow weighed on men
Voices of old despondency resigned
Bowed by the shadow of the morrow, slept

Rex tremendae majestatis
Qui salvandos salvas gratis
Salva me, fons pietatis
Tenor and Baritone:
Out there, we've walked quite friendly up to Death:
Sat down and eaten with him, cool and bland,-
Pardoned his spilling mess-tins in our hand
We've sniffed the green thick odour of his breath,-
Our eyes wept, but our courage didn't writhe
He's spat at us with bullets and he's coughed
Shrapnel. We chorused when he sang aloft;
We whistled while he shaved us with his scythe
Oh, Death was never enemy of ours!
We laughed at him, we leagued with him, old chum
No soldier's paid to kick against his powers
We laughed, knowing that better men would come
And greater wars; when each proud fighter brags
He wars on Death - for Life; not men - for flags
Chorus:
Recordare Jesu pie
Quod sum causa tuae viae:
Ne me perdas illa die
Quarens me, sedisti lassus:
Redemisti crucem passus:
Tantus labor non sit cassus:
Ingemisco, tamquam reus:
Culpa rubet vultus meus:
Supplicanti parce Deus
Qui Mariam absolvisti
Et latronem exaudisti
Mihi quoque spem dedisti
Inter oves locum praesta
Et ab haedis me sequestra

Flammis acribus addictis
Voca me cum benedictis
Oro supplex et acclinis
Cor contritum quasi cinis
Gere curam mei finis
Baritone:
Be slowly lifted up, thou long black arm
Great gun towering toward Heaven, about to curse;
Reach at that arrogance which needs thy harm
And beat it down before its sins grow worse;
But when thy spell be cast complete and whole
May God curse thee, and cut thee from our soul!

At home, whispering of fields unsown
Always it woke him, even in France
Until this morning and this snow
If anything might rouse him now
The kind old sun will know
Soprano and Chorus:
Lacrimosa dies illa...
Tenor:
Think how it wakes the seeds -
Woke, once, the clays of a cold star
Are limbs, so dear-acheived, are sides
Full-nerved - still warm - too hard to stir?
Was it for this the clay grew tall?

Waiting for their offsprings
They are drifting towards south seas
How everything in nature is so reasonable and simple

By gentle foamy crеsts

Everything moves towards sun
And nothing threatens their offsprings
Since cold can't be eternal

Following the call of nature
Overtaking flocks of birds
They are swimming to warm waters

Hiding my face in my palms
I am thinking about tomorrow
And see the caravans of whales
Under the leaden northern sky
Their eyes are closed
Their thoughts aren't troubled by anything
They swim, not thinking
About the future and not remembering about the past

Diving and rising
Following the call of nature
Overtaking flocks of birds

And when loneliness fills
Tired heart to the brim
We dream of promised by someone paradise
A place where we could warm up
An island of peace
Amidst chaos and whirlwind
There, where someone will cover us
From the icy breathe of death

In the midst of endless expenses
Under the freezing clouds
Are gliding the whale and their fins
Cut through huge waves
And I am swimming with them
Overcoming the impossible
Just swimming, not thinking
About the future and not remembering about the past"

Happened in the summer's warm dying light

Nobody did!
The smell of blood is the smell of death
Nobody knows what happened here, nobody knows...

Allumant de blanc nacre
Dieu des récifs, vieux de la mer
Souverain des vagues
Toi qui les fais germer comme des coraux
D'obsidienne de mille reflets
En infinis ruisseaux nous retournons terre
Thymos, nos essences, tes intimes soeurs
S'agitent comme des vagues_"
Sunday Song,Tara Jane O'Neil,sunday song,tara jane oneil,fear,"Of all the rooms in all the towns you end up here
The space you've made won't keep you sane or even clear
And the sun's gone into hiding, but the light is still around
And the pages turn to mirrors, so you step out
She stops behind a bar
Sanded smooth by her own arm
And there's talkers at the tables, weaving fictions in the sweaters
One is writing her a letter and this one drives you mad
Sitting in the pleasure at the bottom of a pool
In an empty room
Where no questions move by a perfect mood
To rest the arm on, to hang a face from
Watching for something good
How would you know, when you're hiding out?
Get out of your head"

To save me from myself
I don't know how you manage
This hell
You're the only one I see
I'm caught in your maze"

And the steel shining blue
He had a hoarse laughing
In a silvery pool

The wind, its moaning and the dazzling lights
He came, the wind...

Such a long, long time ago

Hanging on my wall
It's a faded picture
Isn't there at all
It's only there
When I closed my eyes
And started to cry
Over you
It's a faded picture
I can see it
Through colored tears
It's a faded picture
Bringing back
My lost years
It's only there
On rainy days
When tears have dried
And rainbows started to appear
Oh, I want to go back
When I was six years old
Just lying in the grass
Seeing all the clouds
Building castles in the sky
See all the animals go round
And hear music coming
From a merry-go-round
But it's a faded picture
Fade away on me
So hard to see
It's a faded picture
A picture of my childhood
A faded a picture
I'd go back if I could
It's only there
When I hear children laugh
Sit and play
On a bright sunny day
All so gay
It's a faded picture
So hard to see
When you're cryin'
It's hard to see
So hard to see
Just like a painting
This feeling is falling
My heart's buried
Right in the ground
A masterpiece
Of hearts that've gone
Lost for all time
Gone from me
My faded picture
So hard, so hard
So hard to see
My faded picture
Fade away from me
I couldn't bring it back
If I had tried
I couldn't bring it back
If I'd died
My faded pictures
Fade away
On me
So hard, so hard
So hard, so hard
To see my faded picture
Fade away on me"
Maestus,Maeror Tri,maestus,maeror tri,fear,"- Tipo o barato que eu acho importante, tá ligado Jackson?
É mandar uma ideia pra pivetada, aí né mano, cê ta ligado, os moleques
Eu mesmo né mano, eu vou falar o barato pra você, eu me preocupo pra caralho no meu trampo que eu to fazendo
Porque que nem... É o seguinte, falo pro Brown direto
Eu sou uns dos caras que tem que saber o que fala, se não os muleques vão falar: caralho mano, eu vou entrar no crime também que é mó boi
O Cascão tirou cadeia, tá, viveu no crime e tá cantando rap, então é mó mamão o bagulho
Então eu me preucupo muito nas minhas letras né mano, então eu acho que cê tem tipo que dar uma raciocinada em cima das letras
Pro moleque não pensar que o barato é viver o que você vive, tá ligado?
Acho que o que você vive é consequencia da sua caminhada e tal
Eu acho que a molecada tem que ver o que nós vivemos, analizar e colocar algumas coisas na caminhada deles, não tudo né mano, tá ligado?
- Pode crer, e o rap salva né mano, essa é a prova né jão

Pescando idéia, tire certo do que escuta, vomita
Tropeça na missão, topeira desacredita
Pinote foca corrida, artigo 12 na rima
Na intenção de mular, se abraçar é tripa
Ser Zumbi? Fuck u, na batida trinca
Pra nós, parasita é zica, cola que nós espirra
Quem se explica toma bica
Deu pé na fita, traíra tá na mira
Aperta, frita! Confronto
Jamais moscar no ponto
Derruba fita, me monto, disposição, tô pronto pro confronto
Não esquiva? Toma soco
É ragga, falo roco
Seguro, sem pano, beltrano, hora pro socorro
Perifa, favela, morro pé-de-breck fim do poço
Tandera, zói gordo
Apenas dependo do meu esforço
Corda no pescoço, o crime é criminoso? (pergunta pro povo)
Pedrada na lata, cara, falo tudo de novo
Com meu ouvido ouço é
Olho no olho, mané, qual é que é?
Ja é, deu pé, de ré, só é migué
O zé levou pipoco
Passa a bola, mata o jogo, borracha do louco
É criminal, racional, tô lado a lado com o povo
Falo o que vivo e o que rimo
Pra lei eu não devo e o proceder é de bandido

Gíria criminal vem no papel como Miguel
Não sou tão grande no rap, mostro meu cartel
Vários manos ouvindo um som, nunca de vacilação
Diferente da gringa, o procedimento é no blindão
Firmeza total como já disse o Brown
Trafico a gíria pro Rio Grande do Sul passional
É tanta informação que a mim vem natural
Esse é o astral, ouvir o melhor do rap nacional
Familia RZO junto com Sabotage
Engatilhou Brasil, quebro na rima com humildade
Som de verdade eu trago lá de Porto Alegre
Ideia de mil grau que eu vi dos manos do rap
Não puxo breck, sempre na ideia constante
Metafora, rima fantástica, SP Funk
Rap militante, na trilha do rap um amante
Do nosso som radiante, ao mesmo tempo intrigante
Giria é assim, vem da rua, segura e fica
Dentro da nossa cultura Jackson vem na rima
Cascão e Funk Buia, dá ideia e complementa
No emendo dessa batida, essa cara arrebenta

Assim que é...
Pra enquadrar, dominar, chegar, roubar a cena
Sabotage é compromisso, esta é a vereda
Problemas caretas, resultado? mente alucination
Quem não se consegue ler o meu poema esquece em breve
Revolucionário do sudoeste, Espraiada é meu lar
Favela é um bom lugar
Beleza, disse, melhor que o Show Business
Tolices são ditas porque nada se vive
Daquele caramarão que há sei que tem requinte
Bambas da Orgia, canta lá de um bom lice
Jackson me disse, em Porto Alegre o som dançante é o rap
Zona Pontuária longe da quebrada, até na estrada
Tô com fome héin jão, mas nada peço aos burgueses
Não é frescura não, experiência se obteve
Okay, rezei na fé, assim que pôe é
Pensei varias vezes, não mando a ralé, sabe como é
O povo okay, rezei por varias vezes
Na fé de Deus não sei se errei, talvez não fracassei
Um bom lugar é servir o rap, seja breve
Alguém sabe um guri de leste/oeste
Até a Porto Alegre, na Zona Sul tem quem sabe chegar
De Porto Alegre ou BH, Recife é só colar
Marçal, Beto, Renato, valeu por me ensinar
Saquei, o que não vou ser cunho, um Spectreman, mas ai
Rima forte lhe mostro, olha aqui, não basta que não sei
Prevalecer, tem que ter um proceder
Vou que vou, na rima assim
Fazendo flow
Me emocinou, é bitoca bate forte, eis a mim
Sabotage, rap invade, sou Brooklin
Muito bem, pior já teve agora
Tá melhor, Sabotage, RZO
Ladrão de sacatró, sacatró, sacatró

Cascão, Capão (Capão Redondo), São Paulo zona sul
Jackson, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul
Ore por nós senhor, agora um novo dia
Gíria Criminal, rap é da periferia
Pra quem não conhece, e terror e pesadelo
Sou um vida louca da quadrilha dos guerreiros
A ira, o ódio faz parte do inimigo
Não deves não temes, porque Deus está comigo
Tô no meu pião, de Golf zero jão
Gambé se cresce os 'zois', só que não é roubado não
Pátio DVC, passagem até umas horas
Mas não devo nada, eu to saindo fora
Aê Jackson, ô figura, vamo sair fora aí irmão
Devo nada pra esses policia não
Aí mano o documento é 2002, certo minha abilitação ta í
Que ses quer? só porque das passagem aí
Aí Sabotage, vamo sair fora aí mano
Aí demoro, vamo embora aí, se esses caras quizerem, eles predem nós aí
Vamo, aí, vamo aí, vamo aí

Não é pagando madeira assim, é respeitando quem veio me ensinar
Então pra mim individual, nao é pagando madeira, pra ninguém
Homem, pra mim é tudo igual um ao outro
É isso que eu digo, é só agradeço a ele
De ter aprendido as coisas com ele
E caminhado junto com o Cascão
Trilha sonos do gueto, no ritmo do rap que a gente caminha
Respeitando, sem vacilar com ninguém
Mas aí Edgar, é seguinte mano, os caras que quizerem falar mal
Demoro, se ta ligado, fala mal, porque nós não vamos colar com ele ne jão
Tem colar com os caras que é forte, que sabe a humildade
Meu irmão falava o barato pra mim:
Se você for andar com quem sabe menos que você, anda sozinho
Quem anda em bolo é fermento
Então é melhor andar sozinho"

Never wanted it to be this way
Never wanted it to be like this
Never wanted it to be this way

Time,Lull,time,lull,fear,"Good morning, it's the day that I have made
And it's yours to rejoice in
By the way it's the Lord here
And that sunshine, it is your gift
From me to you, it is free to you
I hope you cherish it not how most people do
So awake, sleeping beau
All night it was me dreaming in you
Breathing in you, speaking to you
I kept your blood flowing and heart beating too
In your slumber, it was me keeping you
Must've been good sleep too homie peep the drool
Now it's time to get up
Open your eyes and sit up
This morning, I hope it's me that you visit with
Cuz last night, you went to sleep so oblivious
To the day that I gave to you yester
I kept you out your tombstone
Not the pizza but the western
Let you go out, live your life, and then I brought you home
To your bed to shut your eyes
But you never said a much obliged
So last night I cried
And in your brain, you thought it was the rain
Here we are, I've given you your heart
I've given you your mind
I've given you your eyes
Open them, and see that I've given you more time
To offer me your heart
To offer me your mind
To lend me your sight
Cuz no sooner than later, I'll be sending your Christ

Bad morning
I think that this day is gon' prove to be more than
More than you can handle right now
So you might as well lay it back down
Back to your unconsciousness
Cuz in that bliss problems don't exist
In that world you can turn Christ off
Why the heck you think you sleep with the lights off?
Cuz darkness is where I shine
His sun is too bright so close them blinds
Screw the alarm, that's what the snooze is for
Who am I? You can call me Lucifer
But my friends call me flesh
The best prince of hell's air, yeah, my friends call me fresh
We've already met, we kicked it all day
All day yesterday, no work, all play
No Christ, all self, cuz when the problems came through
Your Christ was no help when you was in that pickled place
He gave you a little mercy
But then tricked you with sufficient grace
But me, being Mr. Nice Guy
I help while you was in it
And Jesus Christ, really is a nice guy
Don't put Him away, just kinda shelf Him for a minute
Don't offer Him your heart
Don't offer Him your eyes
Trust me, He won't mind dude
Not just yet, Jesus Christ ain't coming no time soon
Instead, offer me your heart
Offer me your mind
I'm kinda tired chasing 'em
Time is so much work to use, but so much more fun wasting it

It's morning?
I feel like I just laid down, like I just got to snoring
Just closed my eyes and slipped on jammies
7 a.m. already? Dang, it can't be
Well, it's time to eat my fast break
First I gotta take a brush to these cold gates
Necessity, because my breath is on stank
Then I can slide downstairs and eat some froze flakes
No wait, I got a choice to make
I could choose to lift my voice to pray
Acknowledge what the Lord has made, and rejoice this day
Be thankful that your boy is awake
Or, I could go back to sleep
Waste the time that I was given to keep
Waste the time that was given to me
Cuz then again, it ain't that deep, but then my heart says
That's not an option, who woke you up man?
You know you clocked it in, wake up
And I reply, that all of that is true
So God, my time, I offer it to you
Offer You my heart
I offer You my eyes
I offer You my mind
I'm not a genius, but I realized that you have offered me more time
So here it is, morning
Not a coincidence that I feel like a war's been
Going on while I was snoring, don't know what the score is
But I know that You Lord win
So I offer You my thoughts
I offer You my dimes
I offer You my speech
You've offered me mercy
So my life is the offering this time"

So far away from my home
Have you noticed that I've stopped trying to get through to you by telephone
I must move on

You will fly, fly high
And see the many wonders that the seasons bring to you
Autumn burning red and amber, summer burning blue
And please remember all you have and not what you might lose
It isn't always easy but it's better when you do
You will fly, fly high
I love you happy and I love you sad
I will love you through good and I will love you through bad

Ho visto Dario uscire solo con la neve
Ho visto l'avvenire lento regredire
Scimmie alzarsi in piedi, poi morire solo per la fede
Ho visto i vecchi offendere i politici in dialetto
Ti ho vista diventare madre, tutto andava stretto
La sabbia lenta se ne andava dal mio letto
Ma la fame è ancora quella di chi stava in otto sotto un tetto
Ho visto i cani litigare per un osso, per un morso
Per un sorso, per un palo, senza alcun rimorso
Ho visto la nazione piangеre in ginocchio l'anno scorso
Quanta gente sе n'è andata l'anno scorso
Non so che cosa ci sia in fondo a questa galleria
Le luci artificiali sono solo una bugia
Mentre tu compri i tuoi biglietti della lotteria
E guardi dentro casa mia, è morta la democrazia

Cosa resterà di ciò che abbiamo fatto?
Scrivo come un pazzo, rido come un pazzo
Vivo come se non mi importasse proprio un cazzo
Piango quando guardo il mondo fuori dal terrazzo

Dopo di noi (Ah)
Sangue e sale
Spiagge vuote, un mondo senza note
Niente da cercare
Dopo di noi (Ah)
Bene o male
Io so che me la dovrò cavare
Tu non mi cercare

Ho visto il bicchiere mezzo pieno solo prima solo prima di berlo
Ho sentito dire: ""Verrò in quel mondo tutto tuo dove fa sempre freddo""
Sangue uscire dalla bocca e no, non per un ferro
Le ferite dentro agli occhi che non serve che bendo
Preferire l'odio però in modo fine
Finta fate fate finta come basta, fine
La luce che filtra tutte le mattine
Un vizio andare oltre un filtro e le cartine
Facce cattive per necessità
Poi usare la fama per scoparsi dentro i cessi i fan
Contare i gesti, fra', il resto è da cestinare
Forse lo scrissi tra le righe e lo leggesti male
Ho i piedi fissi nel domani, oggi
Un giorno magari mi richiami, poi ci
Racconteremo di com'è andata la vita
E quanto abbiamo perso, quanto poco te ne accorgi
Cosa resterà di ciò che abbiamo fatto?
Scrivo come un pazzo, rido come un pazzo
Vivo come se non mi importasse proprio un cazzo
Piango quando guardo il mondo fuori dal terrazzo

Dopo di noi (Ah)

Is this enough to kill

Whether it's for an hour
Or the rest of his days
His family will all
Just Walk away
And every memory of him
Will quickly fade
He will not be remembered
He did not bring change
His story is over
You won't remember his name

He left no mark

Baring only his scars
Heart on his sleeve
Hole in his chest
Only in death
Will he truly rest"

It's very boring
And yet we can't seem to communicate without it
The weather, for instance
Why are handshakes really necessary?
Defense mechanisms
So much time is wasted on things nobody really even cares about
Fake laughter
Fake orgasms
Who cares?
Why are some things considered an insult
While other things complimentary?
Why is it that by the time you can afford a luxury
You're too old to be able to use it properly?
One can waste an entire lifetime dwelling on life's ironies as opposed to living them
It's all quite maddening
Was life more fun before TV, when you actually had to be creative?
How come people think philosophy is something you learn from books
And not something you live with yourself
Why is it that everytime I turn around
The exact person I didn't want to see is standing there
Looking at me
Waiting in the expectation of the things that I'm about to say
But really don't care about

They came from nowhere.  They were emcees. They was DJs.  They was graff writers.  They was hip hop

Yo, whether it’s
Production, mic ripping, rocking cuts, or mixing
If this shit is broke, then Akrobatik’s for the fixing
Cats is lazy like twisting weed with seeds and sticks in
Once the beat’s kicks in, you know the top picks in (What?)
But I ain’t wearing nobody’s suit on Draft Day
Catch me in some Timbs as I stomp through the pathway
And when you hit me with the jersey (Say what?), make sure it says
“Akrobatik MC Number One,” because I’m Worthy (What, what, what?)
Yo, I’ll rip the mic absurdly, son
My existence is a worldly one.  I’m cosmopolitan
Reach inside your wallets and support the cause
Of these rebels without a pause whose lyrics crack jaws
Step back, pause, analyze the scene.  No verbal
Drop kicks and multi-level optics that’s keen
Glaring through any transparent scheme without an x-ray
Enlighten entire nations, do it again the next day
My text play an integral part of your awakening
Shaking in your lungs ‘cause y’all just a bunch of pseudo thugs
So while you do your drugs that make you believe you hard
I’ll rip mics with squads that represent God (What?)

Haha!  Saki.  L.I.F.E. Long, Breez Evahflowin’, Akrobatik Detonate that like: yo.  Check it.  Yo.  (Haha).  Yo.  (Haha).  Yo.  Yo

This Queens
Buddha merchant walks with drunken monk crane steps
On Detonator Recs.  Make my way on
Force through Air similar to my man based in Kunsan
Beats us on hot, chop, toke, choke, then bath
Through smoke clouds in studio bong fires.  I’ll be the wick
To your bomb, that explosive live wire.  Stronghold
Akrobatik, we ichiban.  Our props earned
Kihontekini.  We from NY to the B-oston city
L.I.F.E. Long, Breez Evahflowin’ clutching chromes
With a five-handed fisticuff grip (Haha.  Stronghold),
Sound off, echo
Across globes , crank this rap to crank
Levels to increase the head bop, use fingertips to adjust
Static’s musical renditions of hip hop
We stay on our job
Battle before dodging weak blows, survive alone
Off the flesh of foes, “Hok2” words out.  My bobbing
And weaving leaving cats stuck, swinging nunchucks
The slim samurai releases throwing stars and flames
At accurate range at your stage, shutting down your sound
 in Bean Town

I think they know what we mean now.  Huh.  “So, what would you like with that?  Some Saki?”  Yes.  It is good for my head.  It will make me feel good.  Pass that shit

I’m afraid so
He’s back again.  Rappers lay low like
I tackled their toe, flipped their frame ‘round.  Ill cats
None spat the same sound.  I came to town
Through the harbor (What?), astounded by the drama I seen
Either color.  I’m the service of fiends.  This unclean
Uncut—what?!?  As if I ain’t dipping my stash, I got
This bad beat whipping my ass.  Present it with mad
Rhythm and class, so pass the seamstress site
When it comes to dropping lines this tight, aight?  Light the first
Dutch, spit at your chest, watch it go burst, bust, then
Pull at your heart like thoughts of your first crush
It’s us against you, surface dweller.  Strike your peanut
With the trident of the submariner.  The prince of
The sea since I’ma be on this scene
For a minute ‘til this rap shit finish.  Stronghold
In the Lord’s most beautiful image.  Scrimmages suck
Set it up at your show, dodo.  Step to super niggas
Like Lobo every show we bless
We got the Stronghold, woah, or strong O.B.S
You know me as the B, the R, the E, the E, the Z, N

Don’t take it for granted

...,Parkway Drive,,parkway drive,fear,"I spoke a vow today and asked if God would come and play
I've dug a shallow hole for him to sleep
But I swear he just won't answer me
I call on out, is he afraid? I'll bury him down with the ones he keeps
And if the Devil is listening, I'll come for him as well
If I suspect he had a hand to play
And if I see his face in town, there's room for two down underground
Nothing's gonna stop me 'til I'm done
Until I'm done
Until I'm done
Until I'm done
Until I'm done
'Cause tonight I'm killing gods
Killing gods

It's guilt and frustration, it's everything between
The silence and the absence hitting home
Peripheral glances and the chasing of a sound
I never knew I'd miss until it's gone
So ask me how I'm coping, and I'll smile and tell you: ""I'm just fine""
While down inside I'm drowning in the fucking rain
Because when everything is empty and your heart is set to cave
Sometimes all you wish for is a place, is a place to place the blame

Burn your heaven, flood your hell
Drown you in your wishing wells
Burn your heaven, flood your hell
Damn you all 'cause tonight I'm killing gods

The incendiary shock wave, scorched earth policy
The devastation that only loss will leave
The chants and incantations of daily rituals
A subtle lapse in brutal honesty
So ask me how I'm coping, and I'll smile and tell you: ""I'm just fine""
While down inside I'm screaming 'til I fucking bleed
Because when everyone's expendable and your heart can't take the weight
The last thing that you wish for is the face, is the face to face the pain

Burn your heaven, flood your hell
Drown you in your wishing wells
Burn your heaven, flood your hell
Damn you all 'cause tonight I'm killing gods

I spoke a vow today and asked if God would come and play
'Cause I just wanna cut that fucker down
Face me, face me, face me, face me
Face me, face me, none survive
Face me, face me, none survive, go
None survive
The Devil and God have died inside me"

Whether you'll risk it all on the line just to gain some ground
To show you can soak up the shots fired

'Cause, 'cause I remember
I remember it all started when he bought that car
It was the first thing he ever owned, apart from me
And the colour was red
And the colour was red
And he drove me, he drove me out of my mind
I'm over it now
It was spring or summer '65, I don't remember
Steaming and sweating and sticking against the wheel
And I could see the tendons stand out in the back of his neck
And he used to make me pray wearing a mask like a dead saint
When he put me there in the back seat, and he'd say

Jesus, save me
Jesus, save me

Inherited his father's hate is what he'd say
And he'd cuss enough to strip the paint off Heaven's gate
But somehow he could make joy come loose inside
I would feel really, I would feel really and truly alive
And I would do anything for him
It just wasn't enough, it was never enough
He'd turn to me and say, he'd, he'd say
""Even the son of God had to die, my darling""
And he wanted everything, he wanted everything
He wanted the honey from the cane
He used to make, he used to make me pray
Every morning, kneeling in the backseat, ""Je-Jesus,""
He'd make me pray kneeling there and he wanted everything
He wanted the honey from the cane
""Say it!
Even the son of God had to die, my darling
Go on, say it!""

Alright, ladies and gentlemen, that was the Re-pup-lican candidate, Rocko the Dog. Now it's time for the Demo-cat-ic candidate to say a few words in this debate. White Pet, do you have anything you would like to say?

These rappers, they ain't a threat
I'm the best, they so upset
I stay doing pet things
Don't eat nothing but beans (*bark*)
I'm always getting paper
Be quiet, you just a hater
To these rappers, I'm like a cancer
The money calling, I had to answer! (*bark*)
I'm VIP, where's my limo?
All my money weighs double Lizzo (*barking*)
There's so many haters, you are losers
You little boys to me, you just a junior
Bow down to me, I am your ruler (*bark*)
All this ice making me feel cold
The money keep coming in, it ain't never slowed (*bark*)
All I do is win, get out of here you has-been (*barking*)
, I don't need no twin
I'm up, now you saying we was friends
I don't know you, we ain't never met before
Come at me, you gon' get knocked to the floor
Ain't never gon' be broke no more
You try to mess with me, you better think twice
Eating beans, cause they taste really nice
When I shop, don't care about the value (*bark*)
You suck, I call you a vacuum
Stop hating, go chase a bag
You know I don't ever lag
No matter what I do, y'all always complain
I'm the best, none of y'all can relate
Your girl ugly, she look like a hog
I may be a cat, but I'm top dog!"

And I'm always gonna be here for you
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I'd never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

Come on, hey, hey, we going to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Where's mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin'; it's kinda late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama; she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife honey, let go of it
And don't look so upset, why you acting bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle?
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
Don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eating dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilt ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us

See, honey, there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
There's a place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em, except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya?
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to you
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
She was being mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on timeout
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit trying to climb out
I told you it's okay, hey hey, you wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-goo-goo gah-gah?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up, so I can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie & Clyde: me and my daughter
Me and my daughter
Me and my daughter

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us

Wake up sweepy head, we're here
Before we play, we're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screaming in her ear
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock?
We'll tie it to her footsy, then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now? Here we go, on the count of 3:
1, 2, 3, wee!
There goes Mama, splashing in the water
No more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
No more step Dada, no more brother
Blow her kisses buh-bye, tell Mommy you love her
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a sandcastle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us"

les Fées Carabosse,Catherine Ribeiro,les fées carabosse,catherine ribeiro,fear,"Je n' sais plus, plus rien à comprendre
Ils vous pompent jusqu'à la moelle
Ils sucent votre humus
Et se lèchent les babines

Et comme toujours les responsables
Sont les grosses têtes
Des têtes de fées Carabosse
Qui mâcheraient du chewing-gum

Ils m'ont eue, ils m'ont tout pris
Mais je n'avais rien, rien de ce qui s'achète
Avec de l'argent mais ils ont bu
Mes larmes d'adulte rеdevenue еnfant

Et comme toujours les responsables
Sont les grosses têtes
Des têtes de fées Carabosse
Qui mâcheraient du chewing-gum

Ils m'ont fagoté sur les bancs de l'école
Ils m'ont donné des maîtres tout juste bons à anonner
Ils ont visé vrai mais ils ont oublié
Qu'un jour je saurais la souffrance

Et comme toujours les responsables
Sont les grosses têtes
Des têtes de fées Carabosse
Qui mâcheraient du chewing-gum

Voilà où est la faille, l'énormité de l'?uf
Ecrasé sous le cul de la poule, j'ai marché sur les rails
Des chemins de fer, j'ai ignoré l'express
De leurs voitures je m'en tape, je n'sais même pas conduire!

Et comme toujours les responsables
Sont les grosses têtes
Des têtes de fées Carabosse
Qui mâcheraient du chewing-gum

Ils ne m'auront plus ni avec leurs cosmonautes
Ni avec leurs campagnes en faveur du malheur
Parce que ce sont d'autres qui devraient agir
Plutôt que d'émouvoir le monde par la télévision

Et comme toujours les responsables
Sont les grosses têtes
Des têtes de fées Carabosse
Qui mâcheraient du chewing-gum

Et s'il y a des bidonvilles, s'il y a des génocides
En Afrique et ailleurs, s'il y a des enfants
Pour tendre la main comme je me sens seule
Je hurle et je pleure et je me cache car j'ai honte

Et comme toujours les responsables
Sont les grosses têtes
Des têtes de fées Carabosse
Qui mâcheraient du chewing-gum

Mais ils ne m'auront plus car ce que je pourrai
Leur donner de meilleur, la graine de mon amour
Je la ferai pousser au soleil loin des rumeurs de la guerre
Et si ne pas mourir en héros pour la nation est un crime
Je paierai pour que mûrisse la graine de mon amour
Et je monterai sur le toit d'un autobus
Et je me ferai tondre, s'il le faut, je serai nue
Ainsi la France entière saura et connaîtra la honte

Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Nom de Dieu ! On les a eus !"

Before me appeared a spector translucent and wearing chains

When I bought this house I was feeling happy but now I'm hearing voices and it's really crappy
I bought this place from a guy named Gary I wish he would of told me that was really scary
This house is haunted and I want my money back
I invited my girl over for a chicken dinner
By candle light
I prepared for it all day to make sure that everything went right
But when we sat down to eat and I was about to start romancin'
The bird got up off the plate and started dancing
Then my girl ran off and I haven't seen her since
I'm sick of this spirit's stupid tricks
I wish I could make him go away but
Until I move he is here to stay
This house is haunted and I want my money back
Now I have trouble sleeping at night and my social life is dead
Not unlike the poltergeist who's been screwing with my head
I blame it all on the guy who sold me this place
After I paid him cash he just laughed and drove away
At the time he seemed like a real nice guy the price was low and now I know why I liked the location it was closed to starbucks  now I see dead people and it really sucks

The children were huddled asleep on the floor
No stockings or presents or toys any more
The firemen beat down the blackened door
Six children spread out across the floor
They never saw the scratches on the door

Then came a man from the LG&E
He showed the crowd the tears on his cheek
He brought some gifts in case one had survived
He came to see just what could be denied
But he never saw the children on the floor
And he never saw the scratches on the door

TV news team cried a million tears
They said the oldest one was just eleven years
They showed the fire burning up in the sky
They showed the father, policemen at his side
But not the handcuffs that the father wore
And not the scratches left upon the door

It was the night before Christmas and all through the house

I covered my lovers with flowers and wounds
With laughter, the Devil would frighten
The sun, she would come and beat me back down
But every cruel day had its nightfall
I'd welcome the stars with wine and guitars
Full of fire and forgetful

My body was sharp, my dark hair clean
And outrage, my joyful companion
Whispering women, how sweet they did seem
Kneeling for me to command them
And time was like water, but I was the sea
I wouldn’t have noticеd it passing
Except for the turning of night into day
And the turning of day into cursing

You look at mе now, don't think I don't know
What all your eyes are saying
Does he want us to believe these ravings and lies
They’re just tricks that his brain's been playing?
A lover of women he can't hardly stand
He trembles, he's bent, and he's broken
I've fallen, it's true, but I say unto you
Hold your tongues until after I've spoken

I was taking my pride in the pleasures I’d known
I laughed and said ""I’ll be forgiven""
But my laughter turned round, eyes blazing, and said
""My friend, we're holding a wedding""
I buried my face, it spoke once again
Night to the day were a-binding
And now the dark air is like fire on my skin
And even the moonlight is blinding
And even the moonlight is blinding"

Когда его каждый второй не выговаривает?

Ну, давай, найди кого-нибудь свежей
Да мне похуй: охладить или поджечь
Да, я ем твою мечту на обед
Только по рецепту, дом — одновременно кухня и аптека
Я богаче всех, пока за мной ни цента
Пока бьётся сердце, буду просто делать, и делать, и делать (То, что я умею)
Я готовлю треки каждый новый, сука, вечер
Да, я Аватар — огонь, вода, земля и вера
Я тот самый тип, что смеётся последним

Где-то говорили, что я сделал проще тон:
«Его треки для ротаций» («Его тексты ни о чём»)
«К нему просто доебаться, сразу видно, что мажор»
(«Без чужих рекомендаций он сюда бы не прошёл»)
«И нам похуй на таких, как этот
За ним большие дяди и вагон запретов
Это проект, который прогорит за лето
Я на его концерт не подойду на метр»
Именно поэтому мне предлагали три контракта
Но я выкинул их все, ведь так нужна команда
Это все происходило за полгода до BM
И я с ними, потому что не хотел двигать ни с кем
(Чё ты знаешь?)
Захочу, я буду петь фальцетом
Суки, трек за треком, весь текст об этом
Даже при таких во мне больше рэпа
Только вспомни, где я был ещё прошлым летом

Surrender all that makes you human

My lap her only throne
Swaying to and fro
If only I had known what she needs so very badly
What's bottled up inside
Possessive as I am, I wouldn't trade you for the world
My love is real, and so am I my little girl
Her warmth soon fills my lap
A sigh exits her mouth
She's lost control, I wouldn't have it any other way
Into those broadened eyes I gaze
Everything will be alright
Fear not my fragile touch, but you drive me insane
A spell was cast upon me, I'm a puppet at a play
Strings attached, I'm a slave to your bidding

Yeah, Freshman 10
This shit makin’ me feel old, damn
I gotta go back to '010
When the best car I rode in was a old Benz (Swerve)
And new enemies was still old friends (Friends)
Honestly, I think it was around '09
The time I got the XXL cosign (Yeah)
Remember thinkin’, ""I should been on the last couple years, nigga, both times"" (Both times)
For the first time, felt like I was walkin' in my truth
Cold day in NYC, nervous, walkin' in the room
Bumped into the coolest nigga, Wiz, he like, ""Dude
You made it here too? You know I really fuck with you
I even hit you on MySpace like two years ago, you the truth
Anyway, I'm 'bout to drop a new mixtape
Two of 'em, Cabin Fever and Kush & Orange Juice, I need you on there""
I'm like, ""Shit, send it through"" (Send it through)
Then I saw OJ tha Juiceman walkin' too
He like, ""Sean, what it do?""
First nigga that I seen rockin’ that many diamonds and real diamonds inside his tooth
I said, ""Shit, nigga, just tryin’ to be as poppin' as you"" (Ayy)
He ain’t laugh, it was cool
Then they made us all stand together like we was a big-ass group (Group)
Then I seen my nigga Nipsey there in all blue (Woah)
Back then, niggas thought he talked and looked just like Snoop, damn
I'm just lookin' for this new nigga that Hov' signed
Some nigga from North Carolina
I heard him named J. Cole (Cole) and they said they delayed his flight
So they gotta Photoshop him in, I hope that shit look right (I hope it right)
Goddamn, Freshman 10
The funny thing about bein’ next up is that shit, you'll never be next again ('Gain)
Got my foot in the door, been steppin' it up ever since (Since)
Crazy how some of the longest, most stressful days of your life
End up bein' the times that you wish you could live twice
Only two mixtapes in, but in my city, one of the realest, though
And at that time, niggas peep niggas was stealin' flows and buildin' off it (Off it)
And at that time, that nigga Ye was like, ""Dre, I'm just tryin' to make them Ms off it"" (Ms)
Later that night, I hit the stu' with Nip' and Wiz
French Montana too, but he wasn't on the cover
I mean, at least not ours, but they put him on another (Another)
And to sum up the whole night, I get back to the hotel, few doors down
It was Jay Rock, he said, ""Today was wild, shit
But let me introduce you to my young dawg, next up, named K. Dot"" (K. Dot)
Who woulda thought? It's crazy memories, our gems our mind keeps in the vault
My, how life can change in on year?
Okay, but what about ten? I guess I'll check back in, what up?
Yeah, huh, you know, freshman ten
I know some niggas made it and some niggas didn't (Didn't)
That's the realest reality we all hate hittin'
But love to the whole clique (Clique)
'Cause we got a platform that most don't get (Get)
So shoutout Nip', Wiz and Cole (Cole, who else?)
Shoutout Pill and OJ too (Yeah)
Gangsta Gibbs, Fashawn, Donnis, and Jay Rock too
I pray you got as much love for me as I got for you
Real shit, I think we was the best class that ever came through (Through)

Huh, freshman ten
I remember my graduatin' class in like '06
And I remember between then, and, you know, to the XXL cover
Them was prolly some of the hardest years of my life
'Cause a lot of my niggas, a lotta, you know what I'm sayin'
Just, everybody around me was in school, goin' to college, gettin' jobs, whatever it was
And I was just still chasin' that dream, you know what I'm sayin'?
I just remember havin' to record in my niggas' basements
You know, settin' up the mics in our fuckin' closets and the bedroom
And, just like, goin' in
And all them lessons, even though I had the deal from Ye, which was a blessin'
It was like, shit, Ye was Ye, so he was busy
You know, shit was a little stagnant
But in them four years, when my niggas was graduatin', you know
That was the same year that I got the XXL cover
So in a way, it was like, that was my college degree
You know, all the mixtapes, all that grind, all the hard work
That was like my, my first degree, you know what I'm sayin'?
So I just appreciate the whole process, the whole journey
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda lived in the moment more, but
I guess that's what memories are for"

To start my feeding again I'm peeling your skin
Then you scream, thus release the feelings within
Here's a flyer, missing my event would be a sin
Nigga showtime's at 9, welcome, let it begin

Strange things happen in the nighttime
When you leave your crib to come and hear a hype rhyme
At the show, so I've got you, black Nosferatu
Rock that ass to sleep with a beat then I'll chop you

His Prescription... Pain,Robert Rodriguez,his prescription pain,robert rodriguez,fear,"Transitioned JT’s door opening to the doors of the hospital opening. The Block’s are walking into the hospital, Dakota walking decisively faster and staring forward. The two begin walking different paths.
Dakota:
Good bye Bill.
Bill:
Don’t you mean, “see you later”.
Dakota:
Of course.
Bill turns to a patient.
Joe: (slaps Bills hand)
Hey, what’s up doc?
Bill wipes his hand off on his suit jacket.
Joe:
The little lady’s lookin’ pretty good there, I gotta say. Looks like she could suck the bend out of a river. I’m kiddin’, heh! (shows arm to Bill) Take a look at that shit.
Bill:
What happened to your arm?
Joe:
Well, uh… I got bit.
Bill: (puts on glasses to examine)
Bit? Bit by what?
Joe:
Well, if I told you, you probably wouldn’t believe me. Do I need some bactine or something?
Slight transition into a patient room. Bill presses a large cotton swab on Joe’s wound, to which he shudders. Dr. Felix can be seen in the background looking at pictures of similar wounds on a computer screen.
Joe:
Can’t you just… Sew it up?
Bill:
Well, normally I would. I’d even be doing something to stop the bleeding. The only problem is, this one doesn’t bleed.
Dr. Felix:
Oh, shit. Check this out. When this was still a military hospital, this one guy came back from Iraq with this.
All the men look at the computer screen, which shows a man’s genetalia pussing and charred over. Joe again shudders.
Dr. Felix:
Chronic herpetic lesions. When he urinated, it came out through all these little holes here, kind of like a fountain.
Joe:
Oh, Jesus. Well how’d you treat it?
Both doctors in unison make a chopping method, implying it needed to be severed.
Joe:
Fuck that. I was never in Iraq.
Dr. Felix:
Good for you. The shit they spread around there you wouldn’t believe. I swear to God. I’ve got these Iraqi eyeballs a friend of mine brought back to do some studies on. Incredible. They were completely milked over. Mustard gas, it does that to your eyes. Actually I still have those in my fridge.
While Dr. Felix is talking, Bill is seen checking his own heart rate and putting a thermometer in his mouth to check his temperature.
Bill:
Bot’s fly, do you think?
Dr. Felix:
Chronic viral ulcerative lesion. That looks like gout.
Joe again shudders, Joe checks thermometer then places it back into his own mouth. He then removes another thermometer from Joe’s mouth to check his temperature.
BIll:
He’s running a temperature of 105.
Joe:
Is that bad?
Bill:
It’s high.
Dr. Felix:
Bad would be 108. You could have a seizure, go psychotic. And probably die.
Bill:
Say “ahh”
Joe: (opens mouth and sticks tongue out, which has lesions on it)
Ahh.
Joe:
Oh! Jesus!
Dr. Felix:
Oh, nice. Black abscessed tongue. All abscesses should be drained, period.
Bill puts on a latex glove, Joe continues to stick his tongue out. Joe then moves his glasses to his forehead and leans in, squeezing one of the abscesses.
Joe: (with tongue out)
What are you doing?
Bill:
Shut up, Joe.
Bill’s glasses fall back down onto his nose and covering his eyes. 
He squeezes one of the abscesses and it squirts onto the lens of his glasses.
 Bill slowly rolls his chair over to a telephone.
Bill:
Baby… Get the needles.
Dakota is now seen in a separate room, preparing syringes.
Dakota:
Be right there.
Bill: (over the speaker)
Right. Now.
Dakota:
Asshole.
Dakota has a strap on her thigh that has multiple syringes attached, like a holster.
 Meanwhile she has a pack of the same type of syringes that she’s carrying.
Bill:
It’s spreading.
Dr. Felix:
Holy shit.
Bill:
When did you say you got this bite?
Joe:
Just now.
Bill:
See this? This shows advanced stages of gangrene and epidermal rot. And this over here--
Joe:
Advanced rot?
Bill:
--shows the swelling of tissues and the lack of any type of circulation. See, you’re telling me that you just got this bite?
Joe:
Yeah, just like a half hour ago.
Bill:
What I’m seeing here is a deep impact wound with several virals and secondary bacterials, and that, by the accumulation of denuded tissue around the incision marks, indicates that you’ve had this bite for over 14 days.
Dr. Felix:
Uh, uh, at least 14 days.
Bill:
Could that be possible?
Joe:
14 days? No way, I mean, well… What is today?
Bill: (checks his own pulse again)
Today’s Wednesday. The 15th. Of April.
Joe:
Aw, hell. Can’t I just get a tetanus shot or something?
Bill: (inserts another thermometer into his own mouth)
We gotta lose the arm, Joe.
Joe:
Lose the arm? What do you mean, lose the arm? My arm?
Bill:
It’s spreading all the way up to your shoulder. Now if we don’t sever (makes another chopping motion) that arm now, it’s gonna take over your chest, and we can’t very well cut that off, can we?
Joe:
Well, shouldn’t I get a second opinion?
Dakota instantly walks forward towards Joe.
Dakota:
Hi, Joe. I’m going to give you a very strong anesthetic, so you don’t feel anything during the procedure. These… are my friends. (taps on her three syringes) My yellow friend, is just to take the sting off (Dakota injects Joe), My blue friend you’ll barely feel (Dakota injects Joe with the second syringe) That means my yellow friend is already taking effect. See how fast my friends work? (In a distorted voice) And after my red-headed friend… You’ll never see me again.
Joe drools and then falls backwards onto his bed
Dr. Felix:
They all react differently."

Escalation,Coil,escalation,coil,fear,"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste:
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow
For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night
And weep afresh love’s long since cancell’d woe
And moan the expense of many a vanish’d sight:
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
And heavily from woe to woe tell o’er
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan
Which I new pay as if not paid before
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend
All losses are restor’d and sorrows end
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone, besmear’d with sluttish time
When wasteful war shall statues overturn
And broils root out the work of masonry
Nor Mars his sword, nor war’s quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory
‘Gainst death, and all oblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom
So, till the judgment that yourself arise
You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;
But then begins a journey in my head
To work my mind, when body’s work’s expired:
For then my thoughts–from far where I abide–
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide
Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
Save that my soul’s imaginary sight
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night
Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new
Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind
For thee, and for myself, no quiet find"

Take a look outside
The sun shines
A butterfly just passed by

Too young to die
Yeah!

You must decide
No need to hide
Be cheerful now
Please

Don't be a tease
Smile for me please
Let's see a smile
Please

Too young to die"

'Cause I'm still waiting
To get back to
Ever since it's raining
I let you down

Love is just about
You on a star
This is the sound of it
The worst of us and its drought
Now we're in the night
You're all mine

Go away, I'll be standing right here
Hurts like a stone aside a cave
You still remember
How will I know our love?

Never much about you, stay there
Like a shooting star, we die
I've got some stuff to move on
However I've got no time
Never much about its shine, girl
Like a shooting star, we die
Like a soul, you all die
We're still losing the night sky
Don't you cry

Ooh, I hear you my love
Don't reach out for me
I've got to choose
Ooh, we'll do all we can
'Cause since she's leaving my world"

Science is mouthwash
Science is for the birds
Science is sewage
Science is more than words
Science is baseball
Science is love
Science is all of the above
Some people and their kids like to talk with their anus
Their ?????? and operations were painless
I can’t see where they’re coming from with night-vision goggles
The kind of blind ignorance that boggles the mind
And I’m for sure not feeling them because they’re so dull
And pointless sexual deviance and joints this flexible
Don’t go together like acids and bases
Even without the thick glasses and brasses
Everyone can join a scientific community
The sound of silence if it’s in unity
Can be just as deafening as an experience
So keep your mouth closed and think of it as an experiment
Try to avoid using words like “intelligent”
“Original” or “scientific” cause they are irrelevant
If you don’t submit the proof to reinforce
You’ll have to settle for a dean of course
Science is fashion
Science is spaceships
Science is fiction
Science is relationships
Science is sunsets
Science is love
Science is all of the above
Give me all you got and I’ll ask for more again
The furthest part from the origin is the origin
Birth and death is passage through the same portal
Hope condoling for the immortal soul
Revolving doors four revolving cores in essences
Relaying messages and teaching lessons
I’m here to draw the curtains and to give directions
Offer a few choices and make a few selections of my own
This game is such a gas
That kid wears a T-shirt that says “a touch of class”
Running around with a mic in his hand
Money to spend and is liked by the fans
Praises the Almighty and plays by rules
But his dog-shit ???? was raised by wolves
And even though he comes from a different income-group
It’s not hard to tell that he’s a nincompoop
Science is Fine Art
Science is Reckless
Science is sickness
Science is breakfast
Science is nothing
Science is love
Science is all of the above

So let me consider what's in the refrigerator
For some ingredients needed good eggs wheat and flour
For something salty or maybe sweet and sour
Let me fill my dishes with delicious fish and brown rice
Sounds nice but i can't argue with barbecue
Unforgettable edibles fresh fruits and vegetable
A tomato tornado a plate of mashed potatoes
I'm droolin for tabooli salad lentils and chick peas
I'm ready for spaghetti and cold cuts with brick cheese
I can't say no to risotto i'm lost in dreams cobbler after i eat
Lobster alone with a couple of pieces of cheese pizza, maybe
I can manage to do some damage to a sandwich, marshmallows
Peanut butter and bananas and a big p of deserts like
Pumpkin pies and boston creams. i gobble a peachlate of gnocci from lucky
With pita bread. feed me a fajita or else a burrito 'stead i'll tell you
'bout the merits of carrots my knowledge of scallops and my advice
On brown rice. for the right price you can begin to dig in to more than balogna and finish your bowl of minestrone, please make cheese cake everybody wants a lot of avocado, and a chicken or gelatto watch me wolf down a full pound minimum of chocolate cookies and rice pudding with cinnamon. i'm starving for fried calimari with seaweed trying to save room for strawberries and kiwi's to satisfy it'll take more than a little plate of french fries, falafes, waffels and griddle cakes. all this might be enough but i'm doubtful, so i'm gonna savour the flavour of every mouthful of

I point it out the window and aim it at the river

That the shot, it came quicker than I had expected

The earth spits threadbare its shallow daughters who tread like broken tramps, damp on stone cold stares and deep within the fear of a hundred lonely victims down, the fear of a hundred lonely victims down
Way down deep you know why
I will listen for your baited step like shadows in the hall that fall slowly and trace the shudders of your hollow thoughts and beat my heart against these walls, and beat my heart
It's raining at the border, it's raining, it's raining tears of blood"

That's me

—an 18-year-old honor roll student—

I get straight A's, man

—was in the last semester of his senior year. Justin could hardly believe his luck when a very pretty girl showed up

Naomi!

In not one but two of his classes

Naomi!

She sat in front of him. He switched seats

Naomi!

The last name she used was—

Rodriguez

Justin, what drew you to Naomi initially?

Man, she used to fall asleep in class
She was a light-skinneded Puerto Rican-Dominican—
Long hair, mature in the body like woah

Like, woah

That's not the only reason I liked her, though
She said she moved with her mother to Florida from New York

Where dreams are made

Well, so did I. So I said, hi
She seemed mature, and I talked more

More, more, more!

And I was like, what the heck I gotta do to be with you?

What the heck I gotta do?
What the heck I gotta do to be with you?
What the heck I gotta do?

Who do I have to be for you to be with me?

You told her all this in class?

Yeah. Well, I texted her! Y'know, I was like, what the heck I gotta do to be with you?

R-O-F-L-O-L!

Who do I have to be for you to be with me?

Yes! Next thing you know, we're texting day and night. I trust her right away

Like, woah!

Hey, yo. I never met anyone like her, bro. Yo, she listens to all my problems. I let her copy all my homework. And then I lay it all on the line. And she was like—

No, no—

No! She didn't say no exactly. I don't know

No, no, no, no!

Yeah, I was surprised. I'm a pretty great guy

So? So?

So, I decided I needed to step my game up

Oh, oh, oh, oh

It's too late to be shy. And so I got in front of the whole class one day, and serenaded her. I was like, what the heck I gotta do to be with you?

What the heck I gotta do?

What the heck I gotta do to be with you?

What the heck I gotta do?

Who do I have to be for you to go to prom with me!

You asked her to the prom?

Yeah! I danced and everything

Naomi!

Naomi! I know there's a reason you were transferred here to me

Naomi!

Naomi! I know there's a reason this isn't luck, it's destiny

Naomi!

Naomi! You know me! Will you go to prom with me?

I'll think about it

She'll think about it. She'll think about it. She'll think about it. She'll think about

Drifting forth in fearless flight

I only reap what my father sowed
Brother, sisters, we bowed
Every little bump under his flesh
Our backs are wilted like a rose
How was I to know we were only throwing stones
Once only Romy and I traveled to find my heart
Beating rough, as the earth's glass mountain
Like maggots, they poured from the dog oh how
Bright lavas poured from the other one
Bright lavas poured from the other one
Hold now, I see through the foliage
A smoke that is homesick and wrong

We started to dance and then she hypnotised me
Took me to her sarcophagus and begun to tie me

And I don't know why I cry about your ass anyways..

You always leave me with doubts about shit, But you now I can't say that I didn't love you, But I said it anyways
But i'm proud that you always turn to me for help, But I always cry about the miscommunications that we have, You always have to test my patience, And now I wish I second guess about you, Why did I let you walk all over me but you know I want to make other happy
{Chorus)
Now the butterflies I'd get in my chest when I think about the good times that we had, But I have to cry about a dumb ass
{Verse 2}
Can I please call you one more time before you go, I got no clue why you left but it hurts, But it's to late to fix shit and it's to late to think about that shit about us forever, But I try my best to listen to you but I can't anymore, I might have to let go of you forever

Through the wire screen
The eyes of those standing outside looked in at her
As into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo
In the hand of one of the assistants
She saw the same instrument
Which they had that morning
Inserted deep into her body
She shuddered instinctively
No life at all in the house of dolls
No love lost
No love lost

You've been seeing things in darkness, not in learning
Hoping that the truth will pass
No life underground, wasting never changing
Wishing that this day won't last
To never see you show your age
To watch until the beauty fades

Maybe you and me are hoping for anything
We want this world to know that we're alive
Someday, you're reaching out
For all the times you've lived without
Without the dreams you had down deep inside

The wishes lie, I can't pretend
This life I had to begin again
One day soon, I'll make a mess
Angels come and take me to my nest

I reached down and grabbed my soul

What? Talk’s of living all plush when
Dudes came home fucked up came up work construction
Whatever talent you got you can apply out in New York
Whatever you selling they gonna buy it

Ask dudes pimping them chicks man, a trick is a trick

Bittersuite,Marillion,bittersuite,marillion,fear,"A spider wanders aimlessly within the warmth of a shadow
Not the regal creature of border caves
But the poor, misguided, directionless familiar of some obscure Scottish poet
The mist crawls from the canal
Like some primordial phantom of romance
To curl, under a cascade of neon pollen
While I sit tied to the phone like an expectant father
Your carnation will rot in a vase

A train sleeps in a siding
The driver guzzles another can of lager, lager
To wash away the memories of a Friday night down at the club
She was a wallflower at sixteen, she'll be a wallflower at thirty four
Her mother called her beautiful
Her daddy said, ""a whore""

The sky was bible black in Lyon, when I met the Magdalene
She was paralyzed in a streetlight
She refused to give her name
And a ring of violet bruises
They were pinned upon her arm
Two hundred francs for sanctuary and she led me by the hand
To a room of dancing shadows where all the heartache disappears
And from glowing tongues of candles I heard her whisper in my ear
'J'entend ton coeur', 'j'entend ton coeur'
I can hear your heart, I can hear your heart, I can hear your heart
Hear your heart
I hear your heart

It's getting late, for scribbling and scratching on the paper
Something's gonna give under this pressure, and the cracks are already beginning to show
It's too late
The weekend career girl never boarded the plane
They said this could never happen again
Oh, so wrong, so wrong
This time it seems to be another misplaced rendezvous
This time, it's looking like another misplaced rendezvous
With you
The parallel of you, you

On the outskirts of nowhere
On the ringroad to somewhere
On the verge of indecision
I'll always take the roundabout way
Waiting on the rain
For I was born with a habit, from a sign
The habit of a windswept thumb, and the sign of the rain
Rain on me, rain
It's started raining"

Del tuo passato sono il presente

Tra le mie braccia nei miei sospiri
Del tuo universo vedi i confini
Di questo amore serba il ricordo

I burn for thee at heart
Don't despair me
Come bare me on wings of graveyard robbed leather
To where pleasure rings deep secrets
In spurts after dark
Under full moons waxing lyrically
Death's poetry floods the soul
Like the freezing seed of a demon freed
To curse the stars with vertigo
And in their dance, in trance I've prised wide
Slick rifts twist obsidian thighs
Hymeneal gates to darker sides
A glimpse of plinths where Midian lies
Midian
Haunted by this portent
This obsession in my mind
With a city sunk below
Tall cedar groves and graves sublime
Sporting their importance
Marble wings spread to the skies
A vale of dreams that it would seem
The daylights race to leave behind
These visions struck like a furious fuck
Nailing wet lips to cold cemetery walls
Flashes of lust to dust
Splashed across my psychic pall
As hybrid lovers reached their cusp
With final thrusts I saw it all
Forbidden Midian
A long fabled Judecca
A sanctuary for sin
To rival Heaven
Free of Eden's tragic wreck
Small mercies in vistas of dolmen and vault
Gaunt, haunched edifices
Midst lightfingered mists
From whence more awful shadows
Drew back rusted bolts
And dared a threshold
The searing sun had knelt to kiss
Shades of dusk, cruelty and myth
The Tribes of Christ will not forgive
And shall not suffer their kind to live
For I, mesmerized, started not from tombs
Or their waltz so sibilant
Through the gathering gloom
But from flumes of the moon in bloom
Baring cach a face effaced
And raped in the womb
In hidden Midian
A vatican lying in state
For the sanctity of sin
To rival Heaven
Above Eden's birth defects
Small mercies in vistas where dolmen and vault
Caught twisted whispers where fisted sisters
Haunched, flaunted orifice
Midst lighter fingered mists
Whilst I watched without revolt
Carnalities few beasts permit
Between the dog and wolf
Bared fangs met in intercourse
A nightly rite of teeth and cunt
For those below who rose to hunt
Saw sights that preyed on me for days
And in laudenum's haze
I painted them all
The slew of sith and kin
I drew in blood, my veins in thrall
To Deathugees at peace within
Crotesques and wolves in womens' skins
The raven winged and missing limbed
Suicides and split thighed Seraphim
And marble stairs
Stargazers dare
Ascend like prayer
Under fullmoons waxing lyrically
Death's poetry floods the soul
Like the recking weed of a demon freed
To curse the star with vertigo
And in their dance, in trance I prise wide
Slick rifts twist obsidian thighs
Hymeneal gates to other sides
A labyrinth wherein Midian hides
Midian
I know I've seen
Through the blackbacked mirrors in sanity
Lucent prides amassed in last retreat
Purient souls but no more freaks
Than those leashing dreams at harm's length from me
And just like grim ascension prophecies
My revenge, carved deep, will be
A grisly plot that reads
Like my filthy white ward spattered with their screams
When my Deviliverers come from fog for me
Please come for me
Exhuming the moon
Through the bars in my room
The sooner the bitter pills swallowed are through
But no Genotypes, Aphrodites, Demon archetypes
No Cenobites come to clame me from you
No! No! No!
Don't leave here in this storm weathered cell
No! No! No!
With prophets and losses
And dead men from crosses
My fate is a preview of derelict Hell

（今日という日をどれだけ待ったか）
ハヤル気持ち押さえて 来たんだから
（楽しませてくれなきゃね）
君と行くんだ mid town
時間が来た そろそろ
助手席は 君のもの
How do you feel it?
1, 2 カウントダウン始まる君と
未知の世界へ向かおう
Driving どこでも連れてくよ
行く先は 君が決めていい
Driving まわりのことは
気にしなくていいから movin' on
Driving ボリュームあげて
頭の中 オーバーヒートさせてよ お願い
Driving このまま
どこまでも行こう 夢の続きをみよう
時間の流れなんて 気にしない
（ゆっくり流れていくものだから）
心配はいらない だって君のため
（どこへも逃げないずっと）
Boys and girls 混ざり合う
初めての 感覚で
助手席は 君のもの
How do you feel it?
1, 2 体中麻痺状態
未知の世界抜け出せない
Hands up まだまだ終わらない
今夜のパーティー 帰さないから
Hands up くびれに手を回し
抱く 背中越しに感じて
Hands up こっちを向いて 見せてほしい
笑顔を 私だけに
Hands up 消えない フラッシュライト負けないで
高鳴る 鼓動隠して
1, 2 カウントダウン始まる君と
未知の世界へ向かおう
Driving どこでも連れてくよ
行く先は 君が決めていい

I might be a young girl, but I know how to have fun
I got them boys chasing me, tryna make me the one
When I'm out shopping, it's like I'm having a gun
Whatever I wanna get, got them boys caught up

I know I'm a hot, hot shawty
But you gotta slow down, you don't know me (Slow down, don't know me)
If you in a hot, hot hurry
Then you gotta go now, back up off me (Go now, off me)

(Uh, oh) Got them going crazy, you see
(Uh, oh) Head over heels for me, oh
(Uh, oh) Weak in the knees for me, boy
(Uh, oh) 'Cause you are so damn easy (Damn easy)

'Cause you are so damn easy (Easy, oh-oh)
'Cause you are so damn easy (Yeah, yeah, oh)

I'm much wiser than you think, better act like you know (You know)
Just because I'm a teen, it don't mean that I'm slow
I think you're a cutie, boy, but you're turning me off
Sometimes, you gotta play hard to get and then it's on

I know I'm a hot, hot shawty
But you gotta slow down, you don't know me
If you in a hot, hot hurry
Then you gotta go now, back up off me

(Uh, oh) Got them going crazy, you see

'Cause you are so damn easy (Easy, yeah, yeah)
'Cause you are so damn easy, oh (One take, Weezy)

Baby, tonight's the night
And them girls all on me like white on rice
And I get 'em to the crib, play two on one
I'm already hot, now it's you on one
Take a jet into the sunset, you wan' come
Or sit in my Phantom and chew on gum
Baby, I can take you to and from
Ice up ya little wrist 'til ya blue hand numb
Uhm, you dealin' with a boss, lil' mama
Young Wayne, Tony Montana
And for you, I'll tell my homies I'll holla
And if ya man ain't me, why bother?
I go by the name Carter
I got more plaques than tartar
I'm just checking out the charts on the charter
Number one spot, Wayne and Paula

(Uh, oh) Got them going crazy, you see
(Uh, oh) Head over heels for me, oh
(Uh, oh) Weak in the knees for me, boy
(Uh, oh) 'Cause you are so damn easy

(Uh, oh) Head over heels for me, oh
(Uh, oh) Weak in the knees for me, boy

The inclination of our heart is flawed
There is a sin that easily ensnares us -
A lack of faith in you, the living God
Give us more faith, we beg of you, Jehovah
Please help us out according to our need
Give us more faith, according to your mercy
That we may honor you in word and deed
Apart from faith, no one can fully please you
We must believe our faith will be repaid
And as a shield, our faith provides a refuge
We face the future firm and unafraid
Give us more faith, we beg of you, Jehovah
Please help us out according to our need
Give us more faith, according to your mercy
That we may honor you in word and deed"
fireworks,shackleton,fireworks,shackleton,fear,"It’s hard to be living
You gotta play the cards you were given
You think it’s simple but it goddamn isn’t
It’s tougher now than breaking out of Shawshank prison
And as you’re hittin your prime
People say you been committing a crime
But I won’t quit till I’m home
I’ll chip the limestone a bit at a time
Wait! I’m a pale ass pale middle-class straight white male
I won’t have an alibi the day I fail
'Cause if I ever went to jail, Mom would pay my bail
In a  heartbeat
Mom and Dad have given me a lot more than a pat on the back
And I gotta thank ‘em for loving me
From the moment I was strapped in a Volvo car seat
When I needed a pep talk
I couldn’t remember to wreck shop
Writer’s block, staring at my laptop desktop
Or sleeping in my rental in a turnpike rest stop
Shit in storage, living from a suitcase
Thinking “this is how a silver spoon tastes?”
'Cause you can make a dream possible
But it’ll never be easy, no matter what you chase
If you wanna poke fun then do so
I’ll do it for you, it’s no crime
I’m like if the dude from Juno grew a Jewfro and liked to rhyme 
So tell me that I’m not a rapper
Tell Rudolph he can’t pull sleighs
Tell pluto it’s not a planet
And he’ll probably keep spinning in the same old way
On and on, every day
Right around the sun, wanna feel the rays
You do it ‘cause you love it like nothing else in the universe
And fuck it, it’s embedded in your DNA"
flowers,pride of mind,flowers,pride of mind,fear,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today (Wednesday, 23 October 2013), met with US Secretary of State John Kerry in Rome and said at the start of their meeting:
""The foremost security problem that we face as you said is Iran's quest for nuclear weapons. Preventing that is a goal I share with you and President Obama, and you have said, I think wisely, that Iran must not have a nuclear weapons capability, which means that they shouldn't have centrifuges or enrichment. They shouldn't have a plutonium heavy water plant, which is used only for nuclear weapons. They should get rid of the advanced fissile material and they shouldn't have underground nuclear facilities, underground for one reason – for military purposes.
I think you're right. I think no deal is better than a bad deal. I think a partial deal that leaves Iran with these capabilities is a bad deal. You wisely insisted there wouldn't be a partial deal with Syria. You were right. If Assad had said, you know, ""I am ready to dismantle 90%, 50% or 80% of my chemical weapons capability,"" you would have refused and correctly so, and I think in the case of Iran, it is essential that it be made to live up to Security Council resolutions that demand an end to enrichment and enrichment capability and an end to plutonium heavy water capability toward fissile material for nuclear weapons.
I think we're very close together and I agree with you that the goal is to get it peacefully, peacefully. The best way to get it peacefully is to maintain the pressure on Iran. That's what got them into these renewed negotiations in the first place. The leadership of the United States and the President have shown on the issue of sanctions I think has been centrally important. I think it'll be a tragic mistake to stop right before that goal is realized. And I look forward to discussing this issue with you.
The second thing we're discussing all the time, and I'm not revealing state secrets if I tell you that we, the Secretary and I talk more or less every other day about these twin goals – is to advance the peace the Palestinians. That peace is premised on mutual recognition, of two states for two peoples, of the Palestinian state for the Palestinian people mirrored by the Jewish state for the Jewish people. I think that's fundamental for any peace, but equally it must be a peace that, as President Obama has said, a peace that Israel can defend by itself, for itself, against any conceivable threat. I think these are the two twin pillars for peace and I look forward to discussing how we can advance both goals in our discussions today and undoubtedly our discussions tomorrow as well."""

You were always happy as a child

Coffee sold me for the trophy
I tried to pass it off as love on the lowkey
Oh he must be smoking on the OP
All the dope sees tryna take a lot more than the smokescreen
To hide from what we're coming to
Tell me this, who will you be running to?
Better yet I bet you didn't think you'd run into
A brother that will use what else you speak to run into
And asked her when she look back
Tell nah stays na Budapest
A private mountain for him to rest
Maybe after all that you be blest
And if not them
You'll still love me as a friend
That's just the way I am
This whole life is a part of your plan
Do you all understand?

I will not lose my soul digging for golden chances
No no no no no no noo
No nono no nono nono noo

Missing calls from home, tell my mom I'll be alright
Sippin', droppin' slow, watch me drink the wok all night
Rain falling down while we smoke under the lights
Castle life

I like counting guap on my own
And smoking on that shit got my eyes low
I like counting guap, it's on my soul
But when she's in the room, I'm still alone
I like counting guap on my own
And smoking on that shit got my eyes low
I like counting guap, it's on my soul
But when she's in the room, I'm still alone"
intro,paranoid,intro,paranoid,fear,"At first, I was the only one
The only one who thinks
The only one who speaks
The one who chooses
And at the end, I’m lost
I lost my self in those thoughts
I lost my self in those speeches
I lost my life in this emptiness
I lost my mind in this madness
I don't even recognise my self in a mirror"

Man, y'all did it with this one here, y'all
People love to use that quote, ""I'm doin' it for the culture""
But what culture is that that you're talking about?
The one that you claim as a hip-hop artist
But won't do the research on hip-hop history
Or the one where you disrespect, disconnect
And disregard the founding fathers?
But you know what? Whatever it is, it don't even matter
'Cause as long as I'm alive
I'ma show and prove where this culture came from
And what it's really all about
I got you, my nigga, yo, ayo
[Verse 1: Sheek Louch & 
DJ Kay Slay
]
Count to ten and then come in shootin' (Yeah)
Fuck peace, Silverback the new Huey Newton (D-Block)
I feel it, it's in the air, white cop with a stare
New judge in the chair, this shit hittin' the fan (Woo)
But me, I'ma be smart and legalize my shit
And I ain't leavin' the house without that in my hand (Ahh)
And it ain't only the cops, it's niggas on your block (Uh-huh)
That talk like a lil' bitch and act like they your man

Somethin' like Kris Parker, my UZI weigh a ton
Hundred niggas on the track, then you know I'll be the one
To tell niggas to suck cock, run and get a gun
It's old P, new P, prob'ly layin' in the sun
Prob'ly on a P.I., if I call you king
I ain't talkin' 'bout rap, nigga, that status go to B.I
You can fuck around and get burnt like a C.I
More bars than jail, nigga, who tryna get a V.I?

You dealing with stock owners, conversation with stockbrokers
Make a call for coco, smokin' dope from my crop grower
The block know us, kush got a funky sock odor
How could you not notice? I come from that rock culture (Rock)
Star of the squad but they cannot coach (At all)
Louis Vuitton holster, this for my niggas in the cell
And on they wall, they got a Nicki Minaj poster
The talk's over, no drive-by's, we walked over

COB bandana tied to the end of the AR
Iller than they are, rhymes so sick, give 'em the day off
This is the chaos, Nicolas Cage, face off
The Dark Knight, I make it a dark night when I'm gettin' that K off
Better than whoever done it, even officers better run it
With the drum, I got a technique that'll give twelve a hundred
Now the tables turn, to whom it may concern
I used to control more shooters than David Stern
With Lucifer, hater, burn

Yo, I was in the park spray-painting on the platform
Patent leather top ten, Space Invader hats on
Eighty-something, I've been a threat for that long
Where a lot of people get poked up and clapped on
My job really putting on for the city
You get popped like a wheelie for saying some old silly shit
Tell me it'll be safer to say it in Swahili
They be wheeling you away if you say it in South Philly

Look, thirty shots, I'm shootin' to peel his top (Huh?)
When them niggas sending shots, they shootin' to get the spot
That I'm in, nigga (Hahaha)
You know what it is when I spin the block (Uh-huh)
Uppin' this Draco, the witness is still in shock (Brrr!)
Fluffin' a brick of this yayo, I tilt the pot (Whip)
Tuckin' this fifth, you play with me, you getting shot (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Yeah, niggas still waiting for me to drop (Uh-huh)
I robbed niggas for they base and sold easy rock (Ha)

Fur coats and Magnums
Come through the hall with the big blammers
Bentaygas parked, let me handle this
Jewelry that's flashy, jeans is a thousand, we slick nasty
Pull out a hundred in your housing
Yeah, it's raw lingo in a Kangol
Dutch lit, nuts big as shit, taste the rainbow (Ayo, yo!)
Put your paper up and threaten shit
Or tie something up, send some messages

Ayo, ayo, I used to tell a maid, ""Sunny side up""
Basement, a chainsaw, money tied up
Paper bag over his head, so  let the crocs out
Wave a whole chicken by his legs near the croc's mouth
Sweating bullets in the tip, blow torching his flesh
I seen his face melt, drip gooey shit on his chest
Watch this motherfucker beg for mercy
Shoulda let his wiz suck my dick for that time he jerked me

The soldier I rolls with the coldest clique
Call me prototype, never had a mold to fit
My clothes is dipped, my bros is lit
Only time you been sick is when the COVID hit
Better get in line, I chop the bass like I'm pitching dimes
Code name Coffee Bean how I hit the grind
Precision design, exquisite with the vivid shine
I'm like a European watch on a different time

I used to run around with a MAC-10
Back when I was 20 years old, that was back then (30)
30 clip in the 40, move yayo like 50
Man, I hustle like Nip in the Rolling 60's
I was born in the '70's, grew up in the '80's
Got the MAC-90, then I went crazy
Do the mathematics, y'all can't compete (100)
All by myself, I'm 100 deep

I was on the first 50, now the powers at a dollar
Politician pushing tracks in it, mayor, I president in it
'Til it's humbling, think you grounded and get punished
This the second time Slay needed my two cents to keep it a hundred
How you want it? Fake and be a martyr for this matrix?
They gon turn up the AC then charge you for the blankets
Lux verse mean, got you stuck standing there
Like you at a stop sign waiting for it to turn green, what you mean?

My soul is never for sale
My youngin' just did a twelve, he home, he ringing bells
Wish him well, me and mines on different times
Decline from nigga crimes, I'm fine just spitting rhymes
Read the signs, body language is loud
Cowards hang with the crowd, I ain't never changing my style
Then and now, before that was all that
Fall back, official is what you call that

I be that Third Coast legend, Dirty South icon
Shuttin' shit down, soon as they cut my mic on
From the first bar down to the last syllable
Niggas that thought they were immortal find out they killable
Once I see blood, I'm like a Great White
Catch you slippin' on a late night and it's no bark, straight bite
Watch you bleed out as reality starts to sink in
You tried the Triple OG (Bitch) what was you thinking?

I give the coke to your crew, the butter's crazy
Fallopian tube, just cut it, baby
Gordo butterfly collar cover the Cubans
She need pads like Ewing, I hope you know what you doin' (Look)
Some paid 4-5 serious
I come through, 4-5, serious
Slay got me Shade 45 Sirius
Gold frame shades 45, Siri

I used to be up in a tunnel like a hundred deep
Screamin', ""Nine Trey, Su-Woo"" with a bunch of B's
Never tied up shoes, but every night we would run the streets
Nigga, fuck growlin', it was nights I heard my stomach speak
Then I started pumpin' that bass like they done a beat
Never let shit slide 'cause they might think somethin' sweet
Nigga, it's July, shots get hot like summer heat
When I pop up, niggas turn vegan, they never wanted beef

I know these streets with my eyes closed, so my worst fear is to die slow
Lie low, 'cause in '05 you flipped to Five-O
And I know, 'cause if Alpo did it to Rich
For some bricks, word to Flex, he had no reason to lie, po'
Aight though, we ain't gotta dwell on the past
Devilish laugh, arrow spins I'm ahead of the crash
Better to clash, when you handle your beef, settle it fast
Metal and mask but still keep an elegant class

Who the greatest all time? Where them niggas reside?
I seen all fifty names, man them niggas done lied
I take the first forty-eight, make them niggas retire
Last two we could joust, make them niggas my squad
Fuck them, let's see how the ladies fare
Swerve on these bitches like I'm settin' my baby hair
They feel a type way, but they never gon' take it there
They tryna keep it cute 'cause they know that it's safer there
They wouldn't dare

I can't explain what I dealt with
Know it was all weak and creep and stealth shit
When I come from under the belt with a metal shit
Forever Brownsville, numb, I never felt shit (You're as cold as ice)
I still got that real world charm, nigga, be alarmed
Body armor on, warmer in my palm (NYC)
Where you get the storm before the calm
(M.O.P.) OG and we treat it like Vietnam

My generation drank forty ounces of Old English to ease the pain
Y'all niggas drink White Claws, nigga, we ain't the same (Kahm-kahm)
It's curfew whenever I come through (Kahm-kahm)
Kill the fuckery, them niggas can't fuck with me (Come on!)
I'm really 'bout it in the war
Taxiderm' your bitch head, mount it on the wall (It's M.O.)
Throw it up, nigga, we stand tall (It's M.O.)
You know what the fuck we stand for, it's M.O

Too many niggas in here, but never follow the script
It's movie time, release the clip and have 'em doin' a flip
Off-white Virgil, need a whip with the interior Crip
On any given goal to slide, nigga, minus the slip
Checkin' niggas outta line, like it ain't nothin' to skip
Step in my section trying to flex and end up gettin' you stripped
Too many niggas watered down, might go to sinking they ship
And if it's beef, I come to trip, I never pull up and dip
It's Precious season, nigga

Walkin' in the storm, my face had the hatred in it
Mons had the colorful money with the staples in it
Grew up street and I stay committed (Yeah)
Movin' white back and forth over green like table tennis
Guap was pourin' in, my Glock was roarin'
At nineteen, shots hit you like hydroxychloroquine
I'm still forty with the forty close
In the 840 playin' new E-40 with some horny hoes

(Yeah) Finally, y'all been waiting
To hear a verse for the economy stimulation
With Bible verses forsaken and tribal authorization
We marchin' as we awaken the mobsters across the nation
Ask doubles next to ride
The show gun with Shogun to testify
Fasho son, we hold somethin' that electrifies
N-1 L-B, no one left behind, pause it

Where I grew up in the world of Pop to give you the shot
When I vodka, the Glocka blocka! and blew the dot
You want attention? I'll give you the spot
And run up on your favorite artist aimin' at him, like, ""Do the drop""
I smack the cobble out a gobblin' blogger
Togglin' robbers with my saliva as hot as a pot of lava
And guapa, my mob has been on the sly since Yo Gabba Gabba
Trying to get the drop guava, interior baklava

Straight out the Bronx, straight off the fall
Straight off the motherfucking claw for who's settin' it off
Blocks where they spark a lot, click with the Glock a lot
Catch you at the parking lot, park you in your parking spot
Niggas know it's sex money, flex money, they do a lot
What's better than more letters and buddha spots?
Buck fifties for niggas that don't do a lot
Go ahead and get your shooter, get your shooter shot

Shaq Dies', front if you want
Flow through the spirit of Kobe, I don't puff on no blunts
My estate got a shuttle, you punks
Funny thing I got places in my place I ain't discover in months (Months)
I naturally hover above 'em, I'm Kal-El
Touchdown in the arena, the crowd yell
And if they want beef, I'm ringing the cowbell
This crispy cream make 'em ring like they found Mel

Jones, and I don't need no introduction
I'm the best, pound for pound, it's no discussion
Seen some mass destruction, this how I leave niggas area
Me, Shaq and Gunz, nothin' scarier
A nightmare on Elm Street when I hit the booth
A motivational speaker when I spit the truth
Come down to Pensacola if you need some proof
I could mess your smile up like a missin' tooth
Ahead of my time, but still in a league of my own
I tried to quit, but they just won't leave me alone
If you ain't got the right price, stop callin' my phone
M-mister, y'all must've forgot the king of the throne

Aw man! Ayo, Kay!
Ayo, what up, Red Alert?
I don't think they ready for this
Well, they better tool up 'cause I ain't done!

When you hear the shots
I'm not documenting, I'm 2Pac-umenting
I'm one of the Beatles, how I'm whippin' from that Lennon
Bye-bye, hater, real niggas winning
The 4th of July don't tell me I'm independent (Nah!)
I'm killing it, bro, my motive locomotive
Zero to ninety-nine like my Netflix loaded (Get em'!)
Telling your boss Brick City boys is fire
Never mind, half of y'all be talking through the wire

Media slandered me, so that's why I'm slayin' you niggas
Never knew what hit him, got the doctor X-rayin' you niggas
Turned you to a victim, man, I sprinkle some yay' on you niggas
They thinkin' it's drug-related, gotta weigh on you niggas
All on the radio with the beef, got 'em sweatin' like they was Keith
And it's never gonna be peace, I'm shooting up your album release
Baggin' bricks with your niece, come and get you a piece
I'm taking responsibility for the murder increase, it's Buck

Kay wanted me to be one of the buck because I been a buck
Back when a pack of Newports was a buck, I was a young buck
On the corner of Monarch, kids from Far Rock hoppin' over the turnstile
To set up shop up top by the Jamaican spot
My joints have been a bop, from vinyl, cassettes, CD's and streams
On every Martin Luther Boulevard, they payin' homage to the shooter from Queens
Right now you wanna be this cracker from Queens
Fact though, I'm covered from special fleece to my Wallaby Supremes

This one image is unblemished without one gimmick
Your line of scrimmage, I cross it in one sentence
The core writer for those that lost sight
Of the promenade, now heed the words of the poor righteous
That build with mathematics for those whose path is empty
But y'all know math was in me for the past half a century
Now do the knowledge how the real writers do it
'Cause I want the smoke, charcoal, and lighter fluid

Talk shit, but I could back up game
The way you silly motherfuckers on the mic talk the same old same
How you wouldn't hesitate to kill, buck, rack, attack
Ask him if he said to Shan, he said, ""FUCK THAT!""
Bullshit, I'm not the one to get with
Pressure gets so violent, givin' a fuck what I hit
I play your songs like a lullaby that put me to sleep
And I sing it like a pussy that's this deep

KRS is big and scary
I'm that legend, getting cream, legendary
Hear me, I rocked this, shocked this, hip-hop this
I woke and I wake up, these rappers are not this
The hotness, I would knock some of these rappers out
But you can hear they already unconscious
I got this, on the top list, fake, I'm not this
Temple of Hip-Hop, rising to the top, kid

Every verse is a persecution, it's murder music
You get cursed, the room is like army, they get the hearses movin'
Fire shit, you get burned and ruined, it's burnin' fuses
Bunch of designer, heard a human loses, deserve these bruises (Go)
Nobody tellin' me that it could ever be somebody better
I got a vendetta, I mean every word, every letter
Ahead of my time and you know not to ever put me in position
Designed to put these rappers out of commission
All I spit is dope and after this, y'all gon' need intervention
Taking it back to that driving ambition

Look up to Twista how I be killing 'em like I'm in Wimbledon
I make a sweep when I'm doing the murdering
I put the cinnamon up in the pendulum
Minimum damage I would never do, I dead 'em like a barbiturates
Omnivorous with the flow, it don't matter which bar I bit you with
I could reorganize the confusion of a child Pharaoh
Now munch on that food for thought from a piss poor pimp from the ghetto
Hmm, I am approaching so I hope you're using a radar
Causing beautiful chaos in this unusual séance

Itchy trigger finger, watch me finger fuck it, niggas bust and
Squeeze the biscuit, hit him in his English muffin, repercussion
Call the homies, niggas spray the corner, now they fallin'
On the white sheet and bars, drag rappers by they wife beater
Drama King told me ""Drag, go stupid,"" so I'mma go stupid
Made this fitted cap a drop top, almost Mini Couped it
Stick shift, automatic, automatic big clip, round clip
Hit a nigga while I downshift, yeah

It's me again, all I be is when, never if
If you see a lens, it's probably CNN or a gif
I could rat-a-tatter, your brain matter get scattered
And served up on a platter, they call it data, baiting cappers
I'm more like Beta Kappa, I'm great like your great great grandma
And they wanna protect with this Great Lake grammar
It's Rivers, that's why I gotta be called, decide if you fall
Or have to wear a thought or break a side of the law
And fight for yours

We a hundred deep, don't give a fuck 'bout your capacity
They tell me who they favorite, I ain't hatin' but they trash to me
Y'all know this my world so I'ma hold it down like gravity
I'm bitin', that's a casualty, I'm blowin' out your cavities
Keep a pocket rocket for the people pocket watchin'
Pull up with a Glock and cock it, got you beggin' not to pop it
Y'all gotta stop, I want more cash and more fast
I went on a run like I'm all gas from all bad

You're dealing with a locksmith, my mindset is too meticulous
Rhymes melt when I sing like the wings from Kid Icarus
Every rap is indicative, diction is like a diction
I'm ditching that status quo to inhabit flows that I stitched in
You're pitching garbage, each comment is like a gauntlet
A conscious effort to execute rappers that try to test it
Ingest them and exit through my excrement through my intestine
Intestinal fortitude afforded you is what you left with

I don't smoke but stay with a cig like Mary-Kate Olsen
'Cause my patience short as D Brees or DeRozan
I ain't a Fashion Nova model that swallow rappers for follows
Just for mentions on blogs with flaws like it's Apollo
But keep the toolie, pockets blue like Tookie, patience short as Uzi
You a groupie, you a rat like Mickey, you look like a goofy
Out your kufi, yeah, you out your top, thinkin' you gon' move me
You like Sookie, you suck dick for chips, I'm too rich and choosy, bitch

I ain't gotta tell you what I've done, who I am or where I'm from
If you don't know it by now then you just dumb
I ain't got no pistols, inf' beams, choppers or no Dracos
No car, no girlie, beams or no bankrolls
I buy shares, land, LLC's and payrolls
Kuwaiti and Bahraini dinar, gold bouillon
Mutual funds, nigga, fuck a dollar and a peso
I got seven investors that'll invest when I say so

Hey yo, max eight lines, I wrote this spinning a yarn though
Foul mind, the villainous Queens, Lance Feurtado
Mean face Murcielago, over god flows
Salute that, shit on schedule like it's Jumu'ah
I don't do the work, I just stuff bags to pass shooters
Let the foreign skirt, squeeze semi and let it squirt
All the facts, all the chow now, getting rich off of merch
Laser beams, I done turn niggas' Foamposites to red bottoms

Yeah, I'm underrated and I never sold my soul
And I never switched slang to sound Southern when the game changed
Niggas say they real, 'til you see 'em on the real
Then you find out they a bitch ass nigga, just with a record deal
For real, the internet gon' get these niggas killed
Hide behind that keyboard cuz, gon' make some blood spill
Your insecurity gon' make this .45 open up your mind and bring enlightenment
And then you'll have more clarity

If I roll a hundred deep, it's two hundred fists, two hundred feet
At least a hundred guns so every nigga get one a piece
Bitch, I'll piss on the tombstone you underneath
This sick, don't play this shit if your stomach weak
I can stomach beef, I done faced danger
I squeeze like a waist trainer then you will lose stomach meat
I run the streets, so when Cass scheme, that mean
They gotta get shot like a mandatory vaccine

Out of sight, out of mind, 'til I creep up behind
Double barrel shots you out, everything on your mind
Figure that, like the next line you tryna consider
But you careful so you dumb down, you ain't no spitter
Then you post, you got beef, tell me you ain't no hitter
You a tweeter, who mouth flame more than his heater
From the days of the park jams, blowin' the tweeters
Rugged raps with a DJ cut in the meetings

G-G-Get 'em!
Let me give you facts, before CashApp
I was frontin' niggas workin', they was bringing cash back
Before Instagram was selling up instant grams
Connect 'em and I can never fuck with no middle man
Before the fake jewelry and niggas with all the cappin'
40 karats in my Philly, this nigga was all platinum
Huh? You little niggas in the way
This million dollar payday's me and my nigga Kay Slay

It's the West Coastin', New Yorkin', low-ridin', Crip-walkin' nigga
Anyone can get it, masked like the pandemic
Niggas mad I don't pick up, I got multiple phones
Slay took a month to find me, got multiple homes
Pop off, my black talons will bullet your vest
(Gun noises) 300 blackout, fully suppressed
Cut through your cold crew like a saw blade
Then up at Mr. Chow's eatin' sauté

Jersey Journal, where the next signal infernal
And eat chicken with friction before I try 'em, kidnap the colonel
Trigger title, trigger finger, trigger treacherous
Double shots of extortion, exercise to an exorcist
Exercise my freedom, beat 'em when I leave 'em, eat 'em
Even when the odds ain't even, I get even
With Kay Slay, fuck they play, the rebirth and replay
Mr. Slap-Your-Favorite-DJ, this all has changed on eBay
It's Jers'!

Top billing how we Gizmo and Milk shit
Grimy crimies, did all the dirt and the filth with
Yeah, my young buck days was on the real strip
Fillmore Slim shit, straight off a film strip
I ran through more fine women than Wilt did
Superstars, chem fills bitches with some soft and silk lips
Made a killing off of dealing that real fix
Numbers like a pinball wizard, tilly-tilt shit

I'm the product of Frank White
Whoever acting tough gets stage frights
Getting clearer visions of grave sights
So get my cake right, something in the bake and it ain't light
Or something in your face and it ain't life
So don't play with me, Hell gates await
When I come to the 8th, I shoot it faithfully
And tell Mitch to pray for me
Slay with the AK, nigga, that's my speciality
Brooklyn forever, M.A.F.I.A. 'til the death of me

Look, for my next verse I done left Earth
The internet done triple my net worth off a sweatshirt
Expert, I let the TEC's work, your neck chirp
Been a devil, bench press metal, I'm doin' chest work
One of the deepest, see you've been warned
Please believe you're now lookin' at Jesus in human form
I'm Jet Li, respect me like you speakin' to Scooter Braun
The newest legend in the league, I lead with my shootin' arm
It's PAYNE

All you assholes finished, I don't have those limits
You'll get this work in all black, it's a black-owned business
But you cats don't get it, that's why I'm stunting on you newbies
Your father was a super fan, your mother was a groupie
That's why I trip like, ""Who you tryna rap with?""
Sounding nothing like yourself, who you tryna catfish?
Like you bodied that shit, shut your lying ass lips
Do I look like I been playing nigga? Colin Kaepernick, motherfucker

You got the memo, murder game is my M.O. (Fact though)
Lurk the frontline, not from out of the window (No!)
Take a life, then take your jewels for a memento
You make it to the outro, you got to pay for the intro
Like a nympho, ain't fuckin' around, I ain't (I'm not)
Shoota a sure shot, like a D in the paint
Don't need a long stick, just a .38, I'm straight
One dome shot, that's how I show restraint (Shoota!)

They like ""damn, we ain't heard from you in a minute""
Shit get great from my present, see, bitch, I'm gifted
They said it's only right they callin' me cold, see, I'm the sickest
I heard it just like Curse of the Lottery, you hoes is scripted
Don't get it twisted, me and you, what's the difference?
I'm a superstar, you role playin' bitches is pimpin'
Oh, and did I mention, keep me up out your mentions
You bitches ain't soldiers, y'all just be wantin' attention

Hey yo, New York, get the money, Five Boroughs of Death
My dude was called, where's the money, fire, birds and meth (Hey!)
Hood Bunny, Bugs Bunny, Iceberg, and Sweats
First baguettes, Big Stepper learn the steps
Earn respect with connects 'cause my word was kept (Yes!)
Swerve the 'Vette like Sean Paul for more medicine
Fur gon' slip, like I don't spit, burn the blessed
The truth, 2Pac jewels like I serve them wet
Vado!

This homicide was prophesized before I was a toddler's size
Any job nigga, I am overqualified
I'm the kind of nigga whose cloth it be hard to find
Integrity? I put mine over dollar signs
A nigga play me, then he out his mind
As long as my niggas is winnin', I ain't gotta shine
If you can't see I'm a G, then you kinda blind
Die 'fore you disrespect me, nigga, bottom line

Return of the barbaric barbarian bar spitter
Bar 9 bar guns ballin' like Bar Mitzvah
You bar 9, your bars done, I'm Barific
My bars gifted, real rapper, my bars Christmas
Cooked like a bar & grill, I spit these bars in your grill
Homer bluehead keep a mag, I'm Bart Simpson
My bars mention muscle bars, I'm bar benchin'
Ted Danson have a beer and cheer these bars pimpin'

I see these niggas flex as if I ain't one of the best at this
And wonder why I'm attacking the mic like a pessimist
My name should be next to excellence, bless the globe
With the pestilence, like methodin', and put in work like a Mexican
A record for killin' tracks, somethin' like John Gotti
What he have, like 19? I just caught 99 bodies
Slay, I'm sorry, I know this hip-hop camaraderie
But since nobody bodied me, don't accept my apology

Stop chasing props, niggas, top niggas march
By the cops, followed hot blocks, they pop niggas
I ain't one of you niggas, I'm a pair of Gators
You a pair of UGG's, you ugly but you comfortable, nigga
I'm the OG, pre-Cardi nigga, the diamond in the back
Cadillac black, Pretty Ricky, Maserati nigga
The god-body, rock a party nigga
That can socially distance your head from your motherfucking body, nigga

I'm so Bronx, nigga, my middle name is Jonas
BX microphonist, also known as
The Bronx bomber, comma, hip-hop's Barack Obama
Osama, Dalai Lama, either way gon' be some drama
I'm the one even your momma fall for
I'm droppin' the bat and take it first, nigga, ball four
I'm roundin' the bases while niggas trip over they shoelaces
With they screwfaces, mic broke in two places

100 deep, know how we roll
Find where a nigga sleep, blowing out peepholes
Nothing never been sweet but we icy cold
Put a price on niggas' head for that shit you said
Got back so we boomerang, watch what you say
Hot shit'll spray, in a box you will lay
Know the Mobb be the gang with the Drama King
Always gonna hold it down, that's what I promised P

I did it, y'all forgot, I'm still with the scripture
Every bar has a plot and these lines are configurate
The mind over mine over mind over the pendant
I am signing on the plot, I will put 'em in the blender
A dope spitter with a pro-black agenda
Supported by the black referendum
And this only a sliver of the splendor
Homie, it's the sensei
A dope boy with a flow no lo contendere

They told me pussy and paper go together like problems and pistols
I'm a problem to pussies who want to play with my issue
I'm pullin' rappers close, that shit you wrote was half-ass
I'm way past first class, laugh when your hearse pass
I Kill 'em with kindness, King EDI the highest
Me, Noble, Slay, you can see we the flyest
We load the spray, pussy niggas retire
100 deep, now you can watch us rise up

When 'Rock the Bells' dropped, I was locked into hip hop
Fresh off the porch with my brother Sean's boom box
Around the same time when I heard Illmatic
I was on my block, sellin' long dimes to the addicts, yeah
I remember back when Rae dropped the purple tape
We was young Outlawz, tryna raise the murder rate
Me against the world when I first heard Doggystyle
Still screamin' ""Fuck the world, doggystyle""

No more mumble rap, back to that Boom Bap
No cap, I'm in the trap where the goons at
Peace to all my niggas up top, getting them lunes back
Salute to the brother of me and my nigga Loon back
Harlem World's finest, let's be honest
You don't gotta give me dap, nigga, just pay homage
Peep my steps, always keep the piece on deck
I'm from the danger zone where we handle beef by death, nigga

Everybody's an opp, plenty bodies'll drop
Slay hit me up, told me body the block
Go ape the whole eight, no way they hold weight
They so fake, okay? I won't play, ya don't say?
Kay shit, basic when they spit
Face it, we not only the zone, we the matrix
Your algorithm rhythm off balance
I'm 'bout to start the ""We don't care if you die"" challange

Live from the Wire but I reside in the A
You admire the attire, I am sighin' today
No Jaden but I'm Lord Raiden
Show you with all the cadence
Lightning in my tips, with these scripts, I'm full paid in
And what a great game in Heaven, boosted my cranium
Bars became za induced with titanium
Stars beyond Mars, the truth, I'm so empty
With six spliffs in the booth, it hits like Vibranium

Ayo, Kay Slay, we can't let the BS slide
The game ain't been the same since DS died
Got five niggas jumping out the GS5
Will leave my gun smoking like a PS5
DS5 the street rap, somebody tell me where the streets at
This that shit to make the heat clap
From my niggas selling cheap packs
Them niggas keep straps, the Onyx is the kings of that street rap

It is Sticky, don't make me put my hands on you
Nigga, I could tell you what each one of my fingers do
My pinky finger, that's with the pink ring at
And my ring finger, never put a ring on that
And my middle finger? That's how I feel about that
I use my index finger to make that thing clap
And my thumb, I ain't got a use for that
So I put it in a bitch ass while I fuck her from the back

What you lames claim is relevant ain't
The culture's five elements, felons pistol whip your pelican vapes
I shoulda named the metal Beretta the Drake
Givin' em back to back hits 'til your skeleton breaks
Yo, take a new era super head in my Wraith
Givin' me fitted, call it the 7 and 1-8
Each one of my bars smoke ya whole 16
How you trap in your mom's necklace and wear big jeans?

I ace the motherfuckin' track like a pro's supposed to
I'm blowin' up in this bitch, you know, Apollonia
And anytime I did a rhyme, I did it for the culture
The doctor said I need a culture, I might have the 'rona
I beat the shit and now I'm like a hundred times stronger
Run for the block and flippin' rocks to a stock holder
Hold my composure, bring my hand up when the shots over
A hundred deep with the soldiers, and we shoulder to shoulder

Yo, I live a DJ's dream, hearin' fans scream
Cash in my hand green, they wanted to ban me
'Cause most of it was tax free, at last, me and Slay connect
Niggas know the outcome
We got mixtapes with features better than your album
Bounce Master with the Street Sweeper
For you heat seekers and them double D cup ladies and IG divas
My mixtape gave your boyfriend power
Holla at me when y'all got my flowers (Bounce)

I'm Junior Reid, I run these streets
Killin' all these hip-hop beat
Hey, I just can't be defeat
One blood family, we came here to eat
Murder!
When I roll, you know I roll deep
My hand stay strong and you know we don't cheat
Trap for the money and you know we don't sleep

If it's beef and we don't make up after talkin'
It's a high chance you gon' be wearing makeup in the coffin
I think of Busta Rhymes the way that the cops flamin' us
Like ""put your hands where I can see before it get dangerous""
Fuck twelve and whoever gave 'em information
State property parties, you want a invitation?
You don't wanna do that, family
Them people gon' have to move your family, it ain't a movie, y'all

You woke up a sleeping giant, there's no one breathing this fire
It's me, I'm known globally mostly for being violent
I'm closing up both of your eyelids 'cause no one seeing me rhyming
Fuck quarantine, I'm outside, I'm a morbid beast on the mic
These are more than schemes that I'm writing
It's for the fiends and the piper
New cocoa leaf, it ain't Pyrex, hoping that they don't die next
Shoutout to Street Sweeper, I breathe ether, my team G'd up
The streets need us like cheap heaters and clean sneakers

Wais P, you should have gave me the whole song (Why?)
'Cause I'm doper than the shit Demi Lovato overdosed on
Put a hoe on every corner you post on, poison potion
Give you my life on every track that I spoke on
Blow bullets 'til the barrel is hot enough to cook coke on
Phasers photon, never on stun, give you the whole drum
Wanna know why I'm on the second run? I go dumb
Plus a hundred rounds beats fifty in any gun

I can spot the lies in they lines, what lines in they eyes
Is fear, you hear? A coward cries when he dies
I was down, now I'm up, they surprised by my rise
I've been out, fresh fade, bitches thought that I was Nas
Lord, please forgive me, I'm a sinner
Sweat suits, gold ropes swinging like a '80's dope dealer
Trust me, I get iller, underneath the chinchilla
The Street Sweeper, Kay Slay with a hundred killers

Always been disrespectful, never been polite
Slay got me on the record with a bunch of niggas I don't like (I really don't though)
Them niggas corny, and their verses is not hard
Probably like ten rappers on this record that I got robbed
I'm the truth, I'm just realizing my worth
Niggas gon' turn this shit off after they hear my verse (I don't blame 'em)
And fuck whoever feel disrespected
Niggas gon' be mad Kay Slay put me on this record (Ah)

The best ever, bulletproof, the vest leather
Head shot, talkin' big bags of cheddar
Harlem, we run shit, you fags sleep
Cemetery, last stop, your bag's deep
Six feet, gun and a mask, my team creep
Mausoleum, you can see 'em, your team's sleep
Harlem, mob style, we run shit
Sheet rock, bury niggas for dumb shit

Grenades, bombs and rocket launchers
The smell of dead bodies, the odor comes back to haunt ya
Gucci vests from Dapper Dan, mountains of blow on a glass table
Look like a goddamn avalanche
Construction bags of snow, one scale
One doctor just in case your blood pressure fail
We got diesel, weed, coke and lean by the pail
Two phones next to that old bitch out in Wales

Show a sign, force on the course, it's authentic
You cross the sauce, try to be boss, get lost in it
That's a early retirement, call it a forced finish
Fuck a Porsche with horse, I put your horse with Porsche in it
Nigga, Mike Cee, syllable, syllabicate
Syllabicate, it's so real, realize, realization
Realization, realize, real
S-Syllabicate, s-syllabicate, syllables, Mike Cee

I swear to God if I die tonight, I'm taking a few niggas with me
My little man just came home doing 5 so I gave him 50
I ain't gave his Dior back meaning I got this Llama with me
Run Scott my papers 50 sellin' bricks, I don't fuck with dizzies
Keep a lot of shooters outside, it's gon' be hard to clip me
Before I surrender to God and Mississippi
Got these bitches being my mule to get some bigger titties
Falling cost me 260, got another 60 with me

Fuck y'all, thought I better talk, caught up a narrative
I sat back watching you tryna figure what bag it is
Imagine if I came back, Super Lover with savages
And put a tilting was building change the average of marriages
'Cause she's still after me due to audio in audacity
For cardio and the tune grooving room at capacity
When parties over, we boom boom, for you it's gravity
A tragedy, by two masterpieces causing catastrophe

You could have a hundred verses from my hundred persons
But this one emerges
And it's curtains when you get to squirting on a piece of Birkin
Detroit is a mindset, as soon as the verse ends, you rewind it
Knowing that the Drama King was behind it
I'm Page Kennedy, don't let the last man escape
Get your ass kicked by a movie star that looks more like an asterisk
Get your bifocal lens
You a fighter that wouldn't even punch vocals in

I spit stupid, you just stupid
Don't even walk off your porch, you should just stoop it
You too bitch for this goon shit, it ain't just music
We shoot you and jam to your death, no Rick Rubin
Yo, my gun blow drumroll, 'til it unload
Or 'til the gun broke, then punch holes through a chump's soul
I'm muggin', it's just jokes, I'm friendly and shit
Get higher, it's the highway to Heaven, I'll send you a lift

(Gunplay) 7.62's, nigga never left clues
Crib looking like a motherfuckin' evidence room
And I keep a street sweeper, nothing less than this broom
And that's only when I'm in a fuckin' excellent mood
I got four nine-pieces on a four-door panel
Louis open-toed sandals, overdose on those samples
Living legend in the 'jects, nigga daddy every threat
Homie died in his holster, got the weapon, never left

The pandemic got niggas searching for endemic
You either win or you a dub, fuck the club, don't get it fucked up
It's still paid for the bin
And you just gotta find a fucking way in
Now we gonna see who's a boss
And rise above the COVID or take a fucking loss
Wear the mask or don't, I don't give a fuck
I'ma still get a buck and a gold medal, I will never settle

I be the block (dynamite) so hit the sheets to the streets
Like playing games with Jamar's will beat your feet
I'ma drop a straight 8 for my nigga Kay's beat
We go back like Fat Jack, my nigga, Harlem heat
Got bodies for a throttle smashing King Midas
Put the drip in the game, drop jewels and pop bottles
I'm valedictorian, ask any historian
I'm back from streets, you pullin' up in that DeLorean

I'ma keep the knowledge, yeah, two cyphers
(Keep it a hundred) Lord J and Kay Slay, that's two triflers
We roll deep when we hold heat
Stay away or get sprayed with a new virus
They manufactured a new crisis
With plans to capture your third iris
I stand with the stature of the bird ibis
I'm like Dawoodi when I'm doing my duty (Facts)

I'm from where Big and Hov' came, Pop Smoke cocaine
Rope slayin' over coats and them dope rope chains
Bed-Stuy Veteran fella been ridin'
Better than I've ever been America's bidin'
Harris no comparison since
So don't let that fly shit go to your head like Mike Pence
I got seniority, Francis Sorority
Sonja Blade, bitch, just respect my authority

Let's take it back to the essence where it all began (Yeah)
Hip-hop, the original man (C'mon)
First emcee ain't my claim to fame
'Cause I been getting money, ain't a damn thing changed
I'm Coke La Rock and I'm still on the scene (Let's go)
The true OG to the culture you're in (Okay)
Bronx legend, respect the crown
And pay homage where it started, we call it the Boogie Down

I'm from the era catching cabs on Broadway
Put 'em on hold, ride around town all day
Way before the Uber and a Lyft it was OJ
Do the kickstep, man, just like Kid Play
We're on the east side like DJ Kay Slay
Smoke your Chronic up, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre
Sprinkle my man, E-40, he from the Bay
Yo, I say butter man and you say Parkay

Smooth B kick shit Pelé like soccer
You that man in the middle, cockblocker
I been a G, never been a sucker
I don't hide, never scared, not a ducker
Above the Rim like I'm in Harlem at the Rucker
Motherfucker, I'm thorough with this
I ring bells around the world every borough with this

Always had the bands like Coi Leray
So I'm young enough to relate to the YouTubers
Old enough to still date a few cougars
Yet the struggle became a weapon for me
So success became a separate story
But them cheques, got 'em checkered for me
Shit, I'm shooting from Steph' territory
And I get more love than Diddy's license
We rollin' a hundred deep, and I'm the city's nicest

Look, I'm Tommy Egan in the Honda weaving
Leave your mama grieving for the non-believing
On the deacon, Dominican mommy ganja steaming
Bomb with demons that'll take your chain and go to pond to peacing
I quit trapping 'cause my music is dope
You might've saw me in the lane but I'm truly the goat
You try to tell him calm down, bro was doing the most
They left him in the hospital with a tube in his throat

I trap with the guys knowing I'ma capitalize
But slaps I'ma drive to DC those capital rides
Put rappin' aside I got yak and captions to buy
She smashin' up lines so big they look like capital I's
We back in the times so start us here you back in the pines
Snap but I'm fine the Henny and the gas intertwine
I smash and I grind got the work stashed with the 9
I'm where they'll put you on a shirt like a fashion design

Yo!
You from the hood Uptown Queens, New York
Save the milk cereal with the fork
Scraped the plate and now get the fuck out my way
We on the grind, yes, I got a lot on my mind
Back in the days, I used to wanna punch them in face
I changed my ways and now I just wanna get paid
Smoking haze out a trombone; Nicholas Cage
Fire tire is burning, times is turning

Kaflow Kaboom rolling a hundred deep
Ever since a young wolf, I always hunted sheep
I already killed all the wolves that wanted beef
Seen a nigga brains on the floor and it made ya stomach weak
I'm from the streets where they brag about puttin' you underneath
A lot of niggas gon' get shot before the summer reach
Take you to the balcony, hang you from your feet
My office hours are from nine to five, not from one to three

A living legend like Slay on The Box
The big dime baby, I'm like Jay to the opps
Purple Coogi Purple Tape, I'm like Rae to the opps
When it's time it ain't the mink then I'm playin' the fox
I'm sorry, king of these Pradas and not Adidas
NDF, we the mob and I'm the leader, free the opps
Fear the law, get money, and flee the cops
Fuck the judge, fuck the feds 'cause they the opps

Sickening, street smart but the flow ignorant
Henchmen, but never wear no Jimmy when I'm hittin' it
Big up to the game, bookstores, no more memberships
Shout out to the cub and Dior, free the innocent
Outlaw, live by often, I would die for
I get all the blame, someone get shot, they say it's my fault
So when they talk, I just pay 'em, never mind
'Cause when I spot 'em, I'ma dot 'em like the letter I

I'm Toussaint Louverture, unfamiliar? Google more
Gurkha out the humidor, wise man who fool 'em all
Prove 'em wrong, told Kay Slay I would do the song
Move along if you ain't about that communion, dawg
Through the fog and darkness, the world be in peril
'Til we expel the devils and renew the godly process
I'm blessed, not pressed but I'm vexed, the game culture
Brothers obeyin' other suckers who ain't of us
We reppin' that red, black and green, that's a thing
Like Pythagorean themes that put data in the machines
The latter means I saw a lot, Earth a tourist spot
Still we universal beings, this rehearsal VN
P.S., we turn T-shirts to tuxedos
With flowers from the mall with no GMO's or cheat codes
The power is in lovin' the death of your own ego
O.E. go, that's that Brooklyn

Who really the best rapper since Pun ain't here?
Y'all know the answer to that when Bamz in here
The most underrated, the most hated, the most doing the most
The most almost famous, the most favorite
Bodega getting them chips again, what happened?
First class back from Switzerland, no capping
I'm the voice they wanna silence, who said it's late?
It's perfect timing
Load up the UZI, headshot, take the diamond

In the car with 2 blicks, them shits got 3 attempts on it
You gon' be the first full body
Toe tag, zip 'em up, the doc won't stitch 'em up
Sucka ass niggas been lollipops
Spin the block twice won't leave 'til a body drop
My influence in the hood is impeccable
Stir fry something turn a nigga to a vegetable
*gunshot sounds*
Hello!

It's P dot T dot K, nigga
I'm back looking for drama, I'm here to slay niggas
NYC tryna be A niggas
Blatant only way you figured out to get paid, nigga
And let them niggas have they own style
And act like you niggas really from home
You know that where they shit was grown
And leave that drill shit alone too
Before the shot gets to drilling you
Nigga!

These rappers hoein' now, doin' anything to get papes
Even my DM's like a bitch to do a mixtape
I be killin' shit, I need a sponsorship from Ruger
Been ahead of my time, it's like I rhyme from the future
If niggas want trouble, homie, the trouble suit us
Ran up on you snakes, got me feeling like Medusa
They say they from the Bay, I'm nowhere specific
But those that don't know, nigga, it's a difference

It's getting real hard to eat, no time to argue
Blow a driveway through your chest, let it park you
The broads done rip apart you
Sunset dark you, leave you hard to recharge, it'll restart you
No cinema like our own theatre scarier
Big Dubez, King Kirk, Brando, three of the thieves
Period, lyricists, storytellin'
Cordelen, split your fuckin' watermelon

4D! I go up top, they take enough shots (Enough shots)
Now I'm home, we see what's up then (Home now)
Let you tell it, you Teddy Bruckshot
All I'm hearing is Teddy Ruxpin
Trust and believe, sleep on the D's
Get tough then, mics, I crush them
Causin' disruption, we talkin' a tusslin'
Figure four rap, nigga, fuck all the fussin'
End of discussion

I been livin' on the road for the past week (For real)
Makin' more moves than an athlete (Uh-huh)
I'm from the backstreets where they pack heat
I deliver, got more drop offs than a taxi
Hated by the ones who love, shit's weird
I been seein' six figures for like six years
Young boy goin' dumb and he 'bout to go dumber
Two sticks on him, he think he a drummer

A fist up for black people, our lives matter
Like your life, but my life, they won't understand it
Traumatic stress on my hands, this is from being captured
Mutilated like castration, part of them chapters
But this a never ending story, them pages continue
My shade part of that food chain minus the menu
It's deeply rooted in genetics, the past that we've been through
Original Hebrew, got me feelin' it's sacrificial

I got the power I'm putting in, punching the clock like the '99
'89 before that seventy-five
When I was around and I first rhymed
While many searched hard for punchlines
I had some that you cannot find
Had some that you can't rehearse
All I had to do was voice a verse, the Kay Slay show

Fuck chill, I think it's time that people really know
What's real, nobody else get to spin it
I know these haters won't condone, everything I own
Pointed at the throne, and I don't care who's sittin' in it
Bank on that, nobody son trust
After the clashes and the ashes come dust
You came for the fame, you gotta do what one must
But me, I'm only here to eradicate the unjust
Real talk, motherfuckers the worst
They ain't grow into fuck niggas, they were suckers from birth
Rub shoulders and then it's over, you touch 'em you cursed
I can't wait to put love in reverse
The verse woulda been iller if it wasn't for Slay
He said ""'Sau, it's for the culture, not today""
I said ""Cool, and usually you're always right
But just remember, culture vultures ain't always white""

DJ Kay Slay, The Drama King
Rolling 110 Deep
That's right!
It had to be done!
Everything revolves 360°
What comes around goes around
Bring it back to the talent over popularity
Start talkin' to the people
Instead of about the people
Don't test me
You fuck around next time
I do Rolling 200 Deep on you motherfuckers!"
necropolis,spk,necropolis,spk,fear,"Rotten bodies tortured by shadows
Wicked air over lakes of blood
New-born children with plague-boils
Tearing out the eyes of their mothers
You call it sin he calls it life
You prayed to god but this is the beast
Beware of angels realize
The queen is called Babylon
Dead town dead town dead town dead town
They try to cry - cry out
But files crawl into their mouths
Rain of acid burns out their eyes
But they won't die in our town of hope"
no more,the reds,no more,the reds,anger,"Oh, the company's so good to me

My family's starvin' so am I, but sooner than complain, I'd die...
There's no more reds in the union
Oh I'm paid the lowest wage on earth
There's no more reds in the union
I'm paid exactly what I'm worth
There's no more reds in the union
I think the company is fair
They speed me up but I don't care, my kids complain but I don't dare...
There's no more reds in the union
We never talk of worker's rights
There's no more reds in the union
They tell us that it leads to fights
There's no more reds in the union
Our leaders they have always said that folks that talk like that are red
So we listen to the boss instead...
There's no more reds in the union
Each year we have a swell affair
There's no more reds in the union
The bosses and their friends are there
There's no more reds in the union
They give us food they give us beer
But one thing does seem mighty queer
We eat that good but once a year...
There's no more reds in the union"

Yeah, Amh, checka, Ah

Já fui provado por manos que diziam estar bem comigo
Nunca entendi o motivo, eu só sei que estou bem comigo
E contigo só vivo, sou franco e sou verdadeiro
Não guardo rancor no coração, sou real a tempo inteiro (ahm)
Bem motivado levando a mensagem do meu Deus
Não me surpreendo com palavras desses fariseus
Criticado, mal falado, não apoiado, não complico porque tenho Deus de lado
Bem focado, eu seguro em tuas mãos, não te largo porque és a solução
Estou contigo no mundo ou na contra-mão, e o travão que uso Deus é tuas mãos
Tu me levantas quando eu cair, a tua voz é o que eu quero ouvir
Olha pra mim eu estou aqui, Deus eu preciso muito de ti
Ele me disse para levar evangelho, Marcos 16 comprova a tempo inteiro
Aqui num sai nada, não vão me tirar da estrada, porque Deus é minha morada, nEle alicerço minha casa
Aqui num sai nada, não vão me tirar da estrada, porque Deus é minha morada, nEle alicerço minha casa

I VERSE: Job Zezz
Aprendi a lição, de me controlar
Ponto a ponto, fazer as coisas depois de pensar
Planos bem definidos conduzem ao sucesso
Planos mal preparados conduzem ao fracasso
Aprendi com as experiências tudo coopera para o bem
Aprendi que pra vencer primeiro temos que perder
E que parar de reclamar é o segredo para aprender
Só assim entenderemos, que tudo coopera para o bem
E assim eu sigo avante, sigo para o meu alvo
Maus momentos foram lições, por isso eu não me calo
Eu ensino o que eu sei, partilho o que aprendi
Tudo que eu sei é que hoje eu não vivo somente para mim
Seria ingratidão, se eu não fosse admitir
Se não fosse meu Deus, não sei se eu estaria aqui
Por isso grito bem alto, feliz sobre o asfalto
Vou vivendo a minha jornada, farei isso ate chegar ao alvo
HOOK: Job Zezz

Lose my mind, lose my mind

Oh yeah, oh yeah
I need someone to show me
To show me, to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't find, I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind, must be blind, must be blind
Occupy my brain

Make a joke and I will sigh
And you will laugh and I will cry
I will cry, I will cry, I will cry, I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal
So unreal, so unreal, so unreal, so unreal
And so, as you hear these words
Hear these words, hear these words
Telling you now of my state
Of my state, of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
Enjoy life, enjoy life
I wish I could but it's too late
It's too late, it's too late

requiem,ferri,requiem,ferri,anger,"Pour ce rythme inférieur dont t'informe la Mort
Pour ce chagrin du temps en six cent vingt-cinq lignes
Pour le bateau tranquille et qui se meurt de Port
Pour ce mouchoir à qui tes larmes font des signes
Pour le cheval enfant qui n'ira pas bien loin
Pour le mouton gracieux le couteau dans le rouge
Pour l'oiseau descendu qui te tient par la main
Pour l'homme désarmé devant l'arme qui bouge
Pour tes jeunes années à mourir chaque jour
Pour tes vieilles années à compter chaque année
Pour les feux de la nuit qui enflamment l'amour
Pour l'orgue de ta voix dans ta voix en allée
Pour la perforation qui fait l'ordinateur
Et pour l'ordinateur qui ordonne ton âme
Pour le percussionniste attentif à ton coeur
Pour son inattention au bout du cardiogramme
Pour l'enfant que tu portes au fond de l'autobus
Pour la nuit adultère où tu mets à la voile
Pour cet amant passeur qui ne passera plus
Pour la passion des araignées au fond des toiles
Pour l'aigle que tu couds sur le dos de ton jeans
Pour le loup qui se croit sur les yeux de quelqu'un
Pour le présent passé à l'imparfait du spleen
Pour le lièvre qui passe à la formule Un
Pour le chic d'une courbe où tu crois t'évader
Pour le chiffre évadé de la calculatrice
Pour le regard du chien qui veut te pardonner
Pour la Légion d'Honneur qui sort de ta matrice
Pour le salaire obscène qu'on ne peut pas montrer
Pour la haine montant du fond de l'habitude
Pour ce siècle imprudent aux trois quarts éventé
Pour ces milliards de cons qui font la solitude
Pour tout ça le silence"

We'll dance in the rain
And we'll sing in the sun

But you're being a pest
You know that i love you
But i need my rest
If you love me
You will go pee
Put on your pajamas
And then go to sleep
Please little friend
Get in your bed
And let the adventures
Be dreams in your head
Sleep little one

Yeah
I have tested the limit of hatred
I've been in the maze
Caught in a spiral unsacred
This life I want to paraphrase
I'm unbreakable, I'm uneven
I brought a psychological warfare
It's infinite and cold
It's like nothing can compare
To this imaginary threshold
I'm unbreakable, I'm uneven
Unholy, unbeaten, unbeaten
Can you see the pattern, a spiral appears
This is a prison of belief, blood, sweat, tears
The same things seem to arrive
But in a spiral everything is alright
I can see you're not changing
With your bilingual tonguе
Speak the truth, dare еngaging
Breathe in, black smoke in your lungs
I walk on and I walk alone
I walk on, on paths too known, paths too known
Can you see the pattern, a spiral appears
This is a prison of belief, blood, sweat, tears
The same things seem to arrive
