Yeah?

Richard
Yeah?"
'cause i'm a man,tame impala,"Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time

Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fuck up that I make that makes you cry
I'm as pathetic, as the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

'Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
'Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
'Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware I'm not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled

You wanna know why I always think I'm right?
(Why?)
Can never accept defeat and let it slide
(Why?)
I have no voice if I don't speak my mind
(Why?)
My weakness is the source of all my pride
I'll tell you why

'Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
'Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
'Cause I'm a man, woman
I'll never be as strong as you
I'm a human, human
A greater force I answer to (uh)"
'round midnight,amy winehouse,"It begins to tell 'round midnight
'Round midnight
I do pretty well 'til after sundown
Suppertime I'm feeling sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight
Memories always start 'round midnight
'Round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And old midnight knows it too
When some quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darling I need you
Lately I find
You're out of my arms
And I'm out of my mind
Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around
Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around"
(at your best) you are love,aaliyah,"Let me know
Let me know
Hah-hah, let me know
Let me know
Let me know

When I feel, what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know

There are times, when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know
Let me know

Let me know

When you feel, what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place
Before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say, I'm all about, all about

But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know
Let me know

(Listen)

Tell me what it is (tell me what it is)
There's no need to make believe
(Make believe, no need to make believe)
Look beyond your words (look beyond your words)
Try to find a place for me
(Try to find, find a place for me)

'Cause at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why

(something inside) so strong,michael ball,"The higher you build your barriers
The taller I become
The farther you take my rights away
The faster I will run

You can deny me
You can decide to turn
Your face away
No matter, 'cause there's

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, no, no
Something inside so strong
Ho, something inside so strong

The more you refuse to hear my voice
The louder I will sing
You hide behind the walls of Jericho
Your lies will come tumbling

Deny my place in time
You squander wealth that's mine
My light will shine so brightly
It will blind you, 'cause there's

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, no, no
Something inside so strong
Ho, something inside so strong

Brothers and sisters, when they insist
We're just not good enough
When we know better
Just look'em in the eyes and say

We're gonna do it anyway
We're gonna do it anyway
We're gonna do it anyway
We're gonna do it anyway

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, no, no
Something inside so strong

Hey, these days are long gone
And when I hear this song
It takes me back
We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be
Seventeen
Stealing beers out of the trailer park
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark
My favorite place was sitting in his car
Seventeen
Lay a blanket on the roof top
That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop
The nights were cold, but we kept them hot

Just a small town kind of life
If only I could just go back in time

22nd century,nina simone,"There is no oxygen in the air
Men and women have lost their hair
Ashen faces, legs that stand
Ghost and goblins walk in this land
When tomorrow becomes yesterday
And tomorrow becomes eternity

When the soul with the soul goes way beyond
When life is taken and there are no more babies born
When there is no one and there is everyone
When there is no one and there is everyone

Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
It will be, it will be, it will be
It will be, it will be

The 21st century was here and gone
And the 20th century was the dawn
In the beginning of the end was the 21st
When the 20th century was at an end

1990 was the year
When the plagues flooded the earth
1988 was the year
When men and women struck out for freedom

And bloodletting was the thing that was
People said there was no cause
And there was no reason and there was no cause
1972 was right all the way

Drums and bugles blasting all through the day
Right wing, left wing, middle of the road
And side wind, back swing, back lash, whiplash
Grey stockings, red stockings
Liberation of women, libertion of men
Everyody carry your head low

Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
It will be, it will be, it will be
It will be

Liberation of animals
Prevention of cruelty to animals
Man and beast, flying and on flying
Flying things, revolution of music

Poetry, love and lives
Sex changing, changing, changing
Man is woman, woman is man
Even your brain is not your brain

Your heart is a plastic thing that can be bought
There are no more the diseases that can't be caught
Man became the thing, that he wash up man
Truly became his god

That was the day
That man and woman truly became bored
Man became his good, man became his evil
Man became his god, and man became his devil

Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
It will be, it will be, it will be

Young women without money caught
Big dogs living in marble loves
Young men die in the spring
Boys of seven falling in love

Give their lady fair a diamond ring
Wedding, wedding, wedding
You know a wedding ain't the thing
Don't want no preacher, don't want no preacherman preaching

Give me your hand, and take my hand
This is better than anybody's preacher man, yeah
The truth, the truth is now on pole
It says somebody else, somebody else, so am I told

Don't sway me over, don't try to sway me over
To your day, on your day
Your day will go away

Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
Tomorrow will be the 22nd century

It will be, it will be, it will be

That once we said goodbye

I won't always live
Not stopping
It was my turn to decide
I knew this was our time
No one else will have me like you do
No one else will have me, only you
You'll sit alone forever
If you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for
I'm here I'm now I'm ready
Holding on tight
Don't give away the end
The one thing that stays mine
Amazing still it seems
I'll be twenty-three
I won't always love what I'll never have
I won't always live in my regrets
You'll sit alone forever
If you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for
I'm here I'm now I'm ready
Holding on tight

Made you stronger, unafraid
Got the feeling I've been talking to a dead, dead line
There's always a reason to let it change
Is there anyone there listening while you cry, cry, cry?
Always a reason for the pain
I'm doing the things that I'm told every day, every day, every day
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place, in place, in place?
I gotta believe that you're there when I sing, when I sing, when I sing
'Cause if you're not real, I'm losing my head, in my head, in my head
Got the feeling I've been talking to a dead, dead line
There's always a reason to let it change
Is there anyone there listening while you cry, cry, cry?
Always a reason for the pain
I'm doing the things I've been told every day, every day, every day
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place, in place, in place?
I gotta believe that you're there when I sing, when I sing, when I sing
'Cause if you're not real, I'm losing my head, in my head, in my head
I keep my focus on the simple things
Trying to find some peace along the way"
6 minutes,tricky,"Six Minutes I'm on (repeat)
It's a long way from Knowle West to Hollywood
I've never seen a triple beam
From LA to NY I eat pork make 'em scream

Six minutes I'm on
I'm premenstrual I bleed because I'm not a vegetable
Six minutes I'm on
Lies don't suit me I think it's my duty to say I don't like guns
And in them comes spoil the rude boys funds
I'm resilian I don't just wanna make a million
And if the radio shows throw low blows
We do this with or without the air play
Like a cycle forget about Michael
I'm gonna take this time out for a promotional click
Durban Poison artist are the smartest
In this industry full of vomit
My voodoo make 'em sick
My voodoo make 'em sick

Now when people got a good thing they want to make it a bigger thing
Bullet proof from the truth
Now it's gone to far
And all the tough guys are dropping like flies
Like old styles and riches and those industry bitches
I hear they're taking over the benches
To be high paid wenches

Forget the champaign at the bar you need A&R
Is this making music or money?
I can't make my mind up
They think they're safe 'cause they're signed up
You're under contracts that brakes those backs
You brag and boast now look-a-here I control my destiny
I control my career

Now when people got a good thing they want to make it a bigger thing
Bullet proof from the truth
Now it's gone too far
And all the tough guys are dropping like flies
Like old styles and riches and those industry bitches
I hear they're taking over the benches

赤く染めた頬 濡らす涙
ここじゃ野暮な詮索は無しだ
とりあえず一杯奢ろうか
神の思し召しとやらに乾杯だ

I don't mind, If you feel sad
君の涙はまさにエルドラド

上げる心拍数止まらない 戻れない

AとBの選択肢の間で行ったり来たりした
答えはお互いの出方次第で
本能が煩悩求めた

下手な火遊びかもしれないが

オレンジの満月 見る度 蘇るこの瞬間

Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it

There are no mistakes

Early in the morning

Sometimes you feel like you've got something to prove
Remind yourself that there's only one you
Just take a moment to give thanks of who you are

a case of you,joni mitchell,"Just before our love got lost, you said
""I am as constant as a northern star,"" and I said
""Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me, I'll be in the bar""
On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter
And so sweet, oh
I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet
Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time you told me
You said, ""Love is touching souls""
Surely you touched mine, 'cause
Part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time
Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter
And so sweet, oh
I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet
I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said, ""Go to him
Stay with him if you can but be prepared to bleed""
Oh, but you are in my blood, you're my holy wine
You're so bitter
Bitter and so sweet, oh
I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

a day,styx,"Woke up in rainy autumn
Morning mist beginning to wane
And the birds of the winged trees
Calling my name

Care less the clouds above me
The wind is gently lifting my hair
Where the rivers of the wind fall light rain
Now stand bare

Listen to the flowing streams
Golden in the shelter of my dreams
Playing a song on the meadow that echoes with love

Walk alone through the garden
The leaves are wet with morning's tear
And the whispering of someone
Is drawing me near

Content to rest awhile
Pondering the motion of time
Over unforgotten memories
Dipped in wine

Listen to the flowing streams
Golden in the shelter of my dreams
Playing a song on the meadow that echoes with love

The god of dusk is falling around me
The night air now restless and dank
Yet the fields are specked with flowers
Few and rank

Moon reflecting off the water
Rippling an image to me
Of the way that it is
And the way that it's going to be

Listen to the flowing streams
Golden in the shelter of my dreams
Playing a song on the meadow that echoes with love"
a dream,cut copy,"You think my life's a dream.
I'm dreaming my life away.

You think my life's a dream.
I'm dreaming my life away.

Run, run in circles, barely running.

I'm dreaming my life away.

Barely running.

You think my life's a dream.
You think my life's a dream.
You think my life's a dream.
You think my life's a dream."
a forest,carpathian forest,"[The Cure]
Come closer and see
See into the trees
Find the girl
If you can
Come closer and see
See into the dark
Just follow your eyes
Just follow your eyes
I hear her voice
Calling my name
The sound is deep
In the dark
I hear her voice
And start to run
Into the trees
Into the trees
Into the trees
Suddenly I stop
But I know it's too late
I'm lost in a forest
All alone
The girl was never there
It's always the same
I'm running towards nothing
Again and again and again and again"
a house is not a home,the charlatans,"Oh, the simple cost of loving you is a better picture
There's not a sound coming from my voice
You wanna listen to the kids
Banging on their halos, soon to be divorced
And you're a poor young factory boy
Blowing on your trumpet with a home on the back of your horse

Oh, this is a separation
I can't believe it is the end
You know I don't want to talk about it
Go tell it to your friend

I live and I breathe
With feeling for anything I might have tried
At a point where I can touch her
Everyday I wonder what's going on in her heart
I couldn't eat, sleep, find my feet
I think I used a little too much force

Come see me, you can heal me
Turn your head back to the moon
I don't know why you act so quiet
This is a house, this is not a home

I can't do this anymore, I know it's pointless
I could never be yours
Play to your better nature, we can talk about the old days
I can't help it if you think I am odd
Although our separation, it is too easy
I believe it's your loss

Oh, simple cost of needing you
Is a part into the cause
On the street I can feel a sequel
This is a divorce

Kind ladies and kind gentlemen
This is how it is now, this sound is only coming from my voice
You wanna listen to the kids
Banging their halos, soon to be divorced
And I'm poor where I can find fortune
Every day, I wonder what's going on in her heart

Oh, simple cost of needing you
Is a part into the cause
On the street I can feel a sequel
This is a divorce"
a little bit,tristan prettyman,"These days 'round three o'clock
Rain does start to fall
Downpour on the whole damn block
So loud on the brick walls

Don't go making this easy
Don't go making it hard
'Cause when you come around
Eyes so blue
You know I can't ignore, no I can't ignore

You got something I want
Just a little bit
You got something I need
Just a little bit
No matter how hard I try to fight it
You're gonna bring this girl to her knees

'Cause everybody got places to go
And people to see
Everybody got plenty of time
But they don't know how to set it free
So why don't you come back
Come back to me
Baby come on back
Come back to me

You got something I want
Just a little bit
You got something I need
Just a little bit
No matter how hard I try to fight it
You're gonna bring this girl to her knees

Yes, you're gonna bring this girl to her knees
Bringing it up, bring it down to my knees"
a man like me,beulah,"I've been waiting all night long,
I've been waiting to sing your song,
Tonight, you help me,
Just help me find your key.
I run my hands down your neck,
Cross your back to another fret,
I know you're fragile,
You're bound to self destruct

I can see right through your skin,
Your bones are hollow, they're paper thin.
Tonight, you're weightless,
I know the way you feel

So try
Try lifting all your weight
For a man
A man you're grown
And try
Try wasting all your days
On a man
A man like me

Our love is a lot like yours,
It's been crippled by the wars,
We wage, we're hopeless,
We're on the losing side.
We never speak when we're making love,
You never mean it when you come to me,
With your arms stretched,
Defenseless and alone

So try
Try lifting all your weight
For a man
A man you're grown
And try
Try wasting all your days
On a man
A man like me

I taste you on my fingers
And I smell you on my lips
I don't know where you're going
But you're going to slip
Hey honey better save yourself
You're never gonna make it
Hey honey, honey better save yourself
You're never gonna make it

So try
Try lifting all your weight
For a man
A man you're grown
And try
Try wasting all your days
On a man
A man like me"
a million years,alexander,"I love you like grave danger
Like moon shining disguise
Mmm hmm
When I wake up with your makeup
And spread blush cross the sky

Like a meteor crush
I'm gonna tell the world
Been a million years full of tears
But I found my girl

My notion of love devotion
Was a corrosion of mind
Mmm hmm
Then come cupid and now I'm stupid
And I feel it's just fine

Like exploding face
I'm gonna tell the world
Been a million years full of fears
But I found my girl

It's a spun tongue
It's a holy shit
It's a loud cry from the heart
It's a live death
It's a big breath
It's a no more we're apart

Like a rainbow crash
As we bow and swirl
Been a million years full of tears
But I found my girl

Like exploding sun
Let the light unfurl
Been a million years full of fears
But I found my girl"
a night like this,sandra van nieuwland,"From where you are,
you see the smoke start to arise
where they play cards.
And you walk over, softly moving passes the guards.
The stakes are getting higher.
You can feel it in your heart.

He calls you bluff.
He is the ace you never thought he played that much.
And now it's more than all this cards you want to touch.
You never know if winning this could really be enough.
Take a look, beyond the moon you see the stars.
And when you look around,
you know the room by heart.
I have never dreamed it.
Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it.
I may never see a night like this.
When everything you think is incomplete.
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek.
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed,
dreamed a night like this.

How many times,
have I been waiting by the door to hear these chimes?
To hear that someone debonair has just arrived.
And opened up to see my world before my eyes.
That silhouette creates an image on the night I can't forget.
It has the scent on something special, I can't rest.
If I resist temptation, oh I know for sure that I will lose the bet.
I walk away and suddenly it seems I'm not alone.
In front of me he stands, I stop, before he goes.

I have never dreamed it.
Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it.
I may never see a night like this.
When everything you think is incomplete.
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek.
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed,
dreamed a night like this.
Oooee-oeeee-oeeee-oeeeeh
I have never dreamed it.
Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it.
I may never see a night like this.
When everything you think is incomplete.
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek.
Could you ever dream it?
Could you ever dream it?
Could you ever dream it?
Dreamed a night like this"
a night to remember,cyndi lauper,"I look out my window into the pouring rain
I wish I could tell you that I stopped hearing your name
And then I realize every thought of you runs a circle around my heart
I hear your voice haunting me, I feel your touch in the dark

It was a night to remember
All your kisses I still taste
It was a night to remember
Can't forget the look on your face, oh, no

Starlight send a message like a beacon into the night
To tell you I'm lonely when I shut out the light
Because a part of me left with you
So I feel lost inside
Sometimes I look into my mirror
I see you shining through my eyes

It was a night to remember
All your kisses I still taste
It was a night to remember
Can't forget the look on your face
It was a night to remember
All these feelings I can't erase, oh, no

Endless dreams around my shoulders
I cannot free (I cannot free) this restless heart

It was a night to remember
All your kisses I still taste
It was a night to remember
Can't forget the look on your face
It was a night to remember
Not enough time for you to stay, oh, no (oh, no)

Oh, it was a night to remember
All your kisses I still taste
It was a night to remember
Can't forget the look on your face, oh, no
Oh, no"

Tear you apart pulls you under
And love makes the heart grow fonder

Look at me
We're falling

Your face is veiled to me
A seal of smoke covers thee
How can you breathe
In times like these?
Your covert ops how you tease
Look at me
You're all lit up
Like a Christmas tree

Solitude makes the heart grow stronger
Purifies
Makes you ponder
If this is it
Or just some random anomaly
Look at me
Look at me

Your heart is veiled to me
Do you exist? Is this reality?

Fate, awful fate! Abandoned among the spires of the beast that grows underneath,
You try to keep afloat but you will fail, you suffocate in the abyss of decay!

Right denied! Right denied by your oppressors,
Our primal right is denied! The right inside of you!

The law to break is the one that they impose, not the one that you own!
The rules they made are the ones that you must change to regain your...

Right denied! Right denied by your oppressors,
Our primal right is denied! The right inside of you!
Right denied! Dethrone your vassals! Right denied by your oppressors,
Our primal right is denied! Erase their rule! The right inside of you!

Toto Riina speech:

I Corleonesi nunn' hanno bisogno ru stato! Ave trent'anni che mettiamo le leggi senza
Bisogno di scriverle e siamo noi che le facciamo rispettare siamo noi che
Decidiamo qua va a crepare e qua va a vivere, qua va a pigliare gli appalti e chu
Resta morto de fame, chi se ne deve andare a Roma e chu resta cu u' culo pe' terra
Hann'a trattare cu' mia, Binno! Qui lo stato sono io!

(Corleonesi don't need the State. Since thirty years we've been putting laws,
Without write them down, and we are those who make people respect them,
We are those that decide who's going to die and who's going to live, who's taking
The contracts and who's going to starve, who can go to Rome and who's going to
Be fucked up, they have to deal with me, Binno! I am the State here!)

What is ours it's not something you can steal from our life,
Your the vile, we must despise, we must deny!
Low and confined in a shelter that's crashing down,
You're the enemy we must exile from our life!

Life, what is life? Existence's not enough to wash away the filth you've inside!
Your pride will be replaced by frights, that drag you under waves of stormy sea of regret!
Fate, awful fate! Aghast by all the anger dominating every choice made!
You try to stay alive but you will fail, doomed to struggle to take back yourself!

Right denied! Right denied by your oppressors,
Our primal right is denied! The right inside of you!

Raping our liberty to fulfill their side,
Tantalizing existence of men! They are the leader of nothing!
Bastards who follows the rules that those made,
Their remorse will be the judge of their infamous deeds! Drowned in crying!

Pain and scorn are the ones that you must face not the ones you should take!
The help they gave is the one you must refuse to regain your...

Right denied! Right denied by your oppressors,
Our primal right is denied! The right inside of you!
Right denied! Dethrone your vassals! Right denied by your oppressors,
Our primal right is denied! Erase their rule! The right inside of you!"

He had that Colgate smile, he had that suit and tie
Mama always said, ""Get a rich boyfriend
You don't gotta love him, girl, you can pretend""
You bet I totes believed her, yeah, every word she said
Thought he was gluten-free, but all that I got was bread
Mama always said, ""Nice guys finish last
Beat him at his own game, honey, take the cash""

Ooh, and what a lucky girl you will be
But no, he didn't do jack for me
I want a bean with the beanstalk

We hit that Olive Garden, my Little Italy
Daddy always said, ""Let the gentleman pay
Never ever go Dutch at the buffet""
I saw his bad intention, he didn't wanna talk
He put the saucy on it, time to check my watch
Daddy always said, ""Money can't buy class
You don't wanna get stuck takin' out trash""

Ooh, and yeah I guess it wasn't meant to be
Because he didn't do jack for me
I want a bean with the beanstalk

How could this ever heal
Just come and face me

Something strange is happening to me
I'm overboard and hopeless here
Why don't you finally accept just who I am
Will this ever come to an end

Here I found all my loving
Here I'm holding
Please define all my love

All my loving

accident,lisa loeb,"The heir is introduced
She waltzes through her ballroom
Swirling in her sequins, showing off her gown
She steps on her own train
She falls, she cracks her jaw
Aghast her husband giggles
He gasps
She slipped on spilled champaigne

Chorus:
And we crowd around the accident
We want to see the worst
We crowd around the accident
We want to see what hurts

They're leaning in the corner
He's buried in a baggie
They say he's mischevious sometimes
She's pretty, and her elbows are so pointy
They're dangerous talking in the locker room
His nose bleeds so profusely
But no one tell him he's the star
They watch like at the movies that he's famous for

CHORUS

Two stories about to fall
Boasting at the swing set, marching down the hall
She yelled, 'cause he upset her desk
Don't yell
He's picking sides, he's hitching rides to school
His father left in winter
He's no one's son
If I can poke her with a pencil, I can pop her with a gun

CHORUS

We think...
I'm glad it wasn't me
And turn up the TV
And squeeze our eyes shut, but leave a space to see"

I can carry on fine

Below the equators the sunlight would start
We've travelled through jungles and tigers we've fought

With bones I've left behind?

after the gold rush,natalie merchant,"Well, I dreamed I saw the knights
In armor coming,
Saying something about a queen.
There were peasants singing and
Drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree.
There was a fanfare blowing
To the sun
That was floating on the breeze.
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the nineteen seventies.
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the nineteen seventies.
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eyes.
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst thru the sky.
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like getting high.

I was thinking about what a
Friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie.
Thinking about what a
Friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie.

Well, I dreamed I saw the silver
Space ships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun,
There were children crying
And colors flying
All around the chosen ones.
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun.
They were flying Mother Nature's
Silver seed to a new home in the sun.
Flying Mother Nature's
Silver seed to a new home"
after the rain,bruce cockburn,"After the rain in the streets light flows like blood
I can just taste salt on the humid wind

Here comes that gasoline
Spreading hungry rainbow over shiny black tar

I'm blown like smoke and blind as wind
Except for when your love breaks in

Maybe to those who love is given sight
To pierce the wall of seeming night
And know it pure beyond all imagining

Engine throb street cruise light bullet car flash
Hollow beauty night gleam oily river tension glass

Ultraflame! Glittering dust falling in slow motion
Clouds tumbling one over another into apparent emptiness

It's like a big fist breaking down my door
I never felt such a love before

Maybe to those who love it's given to hear
Music too high for the human ear
And clear as hydrogen to go singing"

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away."
afterglow,chvrches,"All of the black and white
All of the contours
Are laid out before me, now
To leave a trace
With all of the light and shame
We take up our own space
I'll find my own way back
Back to the past tense
A lifeline to highs and lows
To seeing the bright side
And I should know
We wait for the afterglow
To cover the blind side
And I should know
All of the empty thoughts
All of the outlines
Are laid out before us, now
To leave a trace
All of your words and mine
They keep returning
I'll find my own way back
Back to the silence
A lifeline to highs and lows
To seeing the bright side
And I should know
We wait for the afterglow
To cover the blind side
And I should know
I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can"

Like a ray of sunshine from up above, ha

Baby, I'm a tellin' you it ain't no sun since you been gone... ooh, ooh

There's a big black cloud hanging over my head
It's a cloud of loneliness and I feel like I'm dead, ha!
Ain't no flowers bloomin' down at the shore

Girl ya took the light from my world, crushed my dreams
And I don't mean maybe, yeah

An i'ma tellin' you there
Ain't no sun since you been gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Girl, you took the light from my world (took away my sunshine)
Crushed my dreams, and I don't mean maybe (took away my sunshine)

Aww, baby, it seems like night in the middle of the day
Everything around me is faded and gray
Cold are the days, dark creeps the night
Never bringing you back into my life

Cambié el color de mis ojos por marfil, ah, ah
Acostumbrado a mentir
Acostumbrado a reír

Van mil días que no sé lo qué decir
Sin ideas de Buenos Aires a Junín, ah, ah
Oyendo letras de folk
Leyendo un libro de amor

Te busqué pues cada vez que te encontré
Y en tus ojos no vi brillos como aquellos, ah, ah
Del show en el quinto bar
Cuando me viste cantar

Y el verano trajo luces sobre el mar
Y entendí que hay mil maneras de dar, ah, ah
Aunque no te haya hecho bien
A mi manera, te amé

No soy el tipo que parezco ser
No soy el tipo que tú crees ver
Sé que no es fácil para mí ser yo, ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

No hay una sola razón para sufrir
Las cosas siguen su curso como el Rin, ah, ah
El río no tiene fin
Sigue su vida en el mar

Y hoy estás radiante como Nueva York
Y yo estoy pensando en otro lugar

air,atheist,"The air stirs up the galaxy!
Be!...
The crosswinds of forever become me
And place me on the porch of the breeze
Without my sounds would be silent
No gullible gusts through the trees
Carrying seasons to bring us
The atmosphere we all can enjoy and we destroy

The blur on the horizon disturbs me
It casts a disguise on the sun
In the end it's the wind that will weaken
And the human goes from billions to none
The wind will regain all its motion
And clear the air for the following to...(breathe)
(Spoken) The breeze of; a new creation
Moving clouds, from everywhere
Sensing a rainy stare
Smelling the moisture in the air
In the air.

The weather can be deemed as deceiving
To predict the unpredictability
The passion that it feels for the ocean
Air and water sharing laughter
A bond between two forces of nature
All to live and breathe
The breeze of a new creation
Breathe
The breeze of a new creation."
alcohol,barenaked ladies,"Alcohol, my permanent accessory
Alcohol, a party-time necessity
Alcohol, alternative to feeling like yourself
Oh, alcohol, I still drink to your health
I love you more than I did the week before
I discovered alcohol
Forget the cafe latte, screw the raspberry iced tea
A malibu and coke for you, a G and T for me
Alcohol, your songs resolve like my life never will
When someone else is picking up the bill
I love you more than I did the week before
I discovered alcohol
Oh alcohol, would you please forgive me?
While I cannot love myself
I'll use something else
I thought that alcohol was just for those with nothing else to do
I thought that drinking just to get drunk was a waste of precious booze
But now I know that there's a time and there's a place where I can choose
To walk the fine line between self-control and self-abuse

I love you more than I did the week before
I discovered alcohol
And would you please ignore
That you found me on the floor
Trying on your camisole
Oh alcohol, would you please forgive me?
While I cannot love myself
I'll use something else
Would you please forgive me?
Would you please forgive me?"

You know I'm comin through the ville
Grippin wheel

So who slide off the heel
Tryin to get myself a mill
In my system, this is still
How I'm livin, just as trill
Nigga, E don't make a difference
Nigga, feel how you feel
Just another day
On my way to getting paid
Nigga, spray a hater, raid
I'm tryin to stay out they way
Wavin at the babes
On the corner like 'hey'
Stuntin' like it's nothin
The performer in me
Grab myself some grub
Get a hug
Give a pound
Give a peace
Get low
I aint tryin to stick around
Get a beat
Get a girl
Get my gamble on
Get 'em girls, give 'em hell
Keep it movin on out
Back at the house
At a light, BET
PS2, HDTV,
Fight night, night night,
Knock the homie out
Got the shorty gettin aggie
Lookin lonely on the couch

And I'ma still hug block,
Give a fuck what you say,
Pants saggin, du-raggin'
Give a fuck what you say,
Big chain, gettin change,
Give a fuck what you say,

Yeah, it's all about me

Big trucks with them rims
Give a fuck what you say
Leavin' the club with like ten

A hundred grand on the benz
I give a fuck what you say
Cause at the end of the day,
Yeah, it's all about me

Aint nothin changed
But the change
Not a lame, never been
You say fuck me, it's fuck you
Been the same ever since
If you love me, i love you
The game, i was lent,
From the O.G., H-O,
He aint never been
A liar, I concur
With every word that was said
For the family I give 'em
A hundred and ten percent
For the fony I give 'em
A hundred and ten of them
Nigga, nine, m and m
How I could send it through the wind
Back to the grind
Pay the haters nevermind
Being broke is in the past
I pray I never rewind
Fine wine dreams
Rockin' gators, lime green
Out in Vegas with my team
Breakin tables, na-mean?
Money on the wall,
Make the game go good
Have money on the ave
But the shit never last
Puff, puff, pass,
Nigga that's how we live
Everyday,
So keep the misery where you is,
Nigga

We got a problem
This represents the struggle
The hustle, the bums,
The rats, the roaches,
Nigga that's where we from
Summertime cookout
Open up the johnny pumps
Baby, I don't care
If you just got your hair done
You still gettin wet
Young hustlers on the steps
Tryin to follow in the steps
Of the vets
From the jets
Young niggaz act hard
Ballin's in the back park
Me, I played the monkey bars
On girls, tried to mack hard
Back when cane was blastin from the car
Got a package of cane
Brought at you to the yard
And uuuuh ...

Yesterday, you asked me something I thought you knew
So, I told you with a smile
It's all about you

Then you whispered in my ear and you told me too
Said, ""You make my life worthwhile""
It's all about you

And I would answer all your wishes
If you asked me to
But if you deny me one of your kisses
Don't know what I'd do

So hold me close and say three words like you used to do
Dancing on the kitchen tiles, it's all about you
Yeah

And I would answer all your wishes
If you asked me to
But if you deny me one of your kisses
Don't know what I'd do

So hold me close and say three words like you used to do
Dancing on the kitchen tiles
Yes, you make my life worthwhile
So I told you with a smile, ""It's all about you""

I'm addicted to highs, would you like to know why?
When the months change, so do my love point of views
I don't want what I need, what I need hates me, what I need hates me

I know all along, all along

It's crazy, but all along, all along
I knew I was meant to be alone

Who will be the villain? All the strangers voted for him

Like a river to the ocean
Love keeps bringing me back to you
An irresistable emotion
I can't deny the truth
Cos I searched far and wide
Until I realised, yeah I knew
All I want is you

I've had a change of heart
I know that I was wrong
And now there's an emptiness
That lingers on and on
Cos even after all this time
You're the one thing on my mind
I try to run away but there's no escape
My heart could never lie cos...

Chorus

Now some people spend their lives

Searching for the one
Suddenly I realised the crazy thing I'd done
Cos you were standing right beside me
But like a fool I could not see
Now I need search no more
This time I feel so sure
That you're everything I need

Chorus

All I want is to love you baby

Walk over to the window
I want to see the ocean
I want to walk next to you
Feel the love you're setting free
Wrap itself around me like a blanket
I look into my baby's eyes
So I can be for just one minute
The child I never was
I want to make up
I want to walk right up to me and scream ""You know,
There's a reason for everything""
All that I want
All that I need
Is to know it's real
In all I dream
In the way I feel
Got to know it's real
I want to wake up in the morning
Walk over to the window
I want to feel emotion
No one to pull through this
Fly above the house and let time slip
Only gets worse when you fight it
Want to know what happens when I die
So I can know why I feel fear and love
For the child I never knew
I want to be brave
Want to walk right up to me and scream ""You know,
There's a reason for everything""
All that I want
All that I need
Is to know it's real
In all I dream
In the way I feel
Got to know it's real"

all my friends,lcd soundsystem,"That's how it starts
We go back to your house
We check the charts
And start to figure it out

And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways we show our age

And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
And I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet

You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again

You're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except in parts
When the moral kicks in

Though when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's winding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life

You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired only where are your friends tonight?

And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sail's force into the night

And if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a fool
On the road, there's always this
And if I'm sewn into submission
I can still come home to this

And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids leave impossible tasks
You think over and over, ""hey, I'm finally dead""
Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You look contorted on yourself your ridiculous prop
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you always knew you were tired, but then
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight"
all my life,evan dando,"Just look for sunshine
To burn in full time
To be filled with hatred
For the time I've wasted
And I'm so impatient
For a new sensation

God knows what I thought I'd do
I bit my own sweet heart in two

All my life
I thought I needed all the things I didn't need at all
My life
I thought I wanted all the things I didn't want at all

Just to hold my heart beat
In a box by my feet
To be filled with glory
To speak a story
Can you feel the thunder
From the cloud I'm under

God knows how will I get through
I bit my own sweet heart and blew it

All my life
I thought I needed all the things I didn't need at all
My life
I thought I wanted all the things I didn't want at all

Oh yeah
Woah
Yeah
Oooh

Baby
There wasn't anything I didn't love about you
You'd do some stupid things and I'd laugh at those too
And we went together like the summer in June

But who'd have known that it'd rain so soon
Thought I'd be the only one that'd make you smile
Thought I'd be the only one that'd really know how
But you showed me different and I know better now
I gotta get you out my system somehow

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we ain't even friends
You could've been my
All or nothing

All or nothing
Now to me you're nothing
Girl you're nothing
Now you're nothing

Put you on a pedestal, girl, I held you so high
Was never too good at finding the words to describe
Just how I felt for you but you know that I tried
But somehow we went and changed inside
You damn near were my everything you're still on my mind

But I'd rather be here all alone and I'm doing just fine
Gotta take it back to the days before we met
And live our lives as strangers again
I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we ain't even friends

You could've been my
All or nothing
All or nothing
Now to me you're nothing

Girl you're nothing
Now you're nothing
I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we ain't even friends

You could've been my
All or nothing
All or nothing
Now to me you're nothing
Girl you're nothing
Now you're nothing
December days
My summer turned to winter
When you went away
I can't help but wonder
Was he worth my pain?
You should know better
And I should've too
And I cried
And you cried and we tried to make it work
Almost died while we tried
Is that what our love was worth?
If I could do it again
I would be a better man
Now I'm living with just memories
I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we ain't even friends
You could've been my
All or nothing
All or nothing
Now to me you're nothing
Girl you're nothing
Now you're nothing
I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we ain't even friends
You could've been my

all out of love,soft cell,"I'm all out of love, have I given too much?
I'm all out of love because there's never enough
I'm all out of love, have I given too much
I'm all out of love

Drawing up all my years, I'm trying to feel something
Calling on my lost tears, just trying to feel
Summoning all my passion, some place I've long forgotten
My anxieties magnify, doctor can you tell me why?

I'm all out of love, there's never enough
I'm all out of love, I'm all out of love
Have I given too much, I'm all out of love

So many doubts, so many fears
All those demons that rise with the years
Love came calling but the cupboard was bare
I try to find my heart but it wasn't there

Am I a spent force? Used up?
Washed up? Left out to dry?
Is it the same for everybody
Doctor can you tell me why?

I'm all out of love, there's never enough
I'm all out of love, I'm all out of love
Have I given too much, I'm all out of love

When regret comes to call
It's a fear that visits us all
Any love that's left is mine
To keep me warm

For what's left of my time
As the final act approaches
If I could I'd sit and cry
But I'm drained of all emotion
Doctor can you tell me why?

I'm all out of love, there's never enough
I'm all out of love, I'm all out of love
Have I given too much, I'm all out of love

I'm all out of love, I've given too much
I'm all out of love, never enough

I'm all out of love, I'm all out of love
I'm all out of love"
all over me,graham coxon,"Hey, went in the shower
And I fainted on the floor
I was free swimming in light
You were so scared
You washed my head
In bright red water
You really though
I was dead

I know why you make me so scared
You're all I can see
You speak and my hearing is impaired
You're all over me

Laid in your bed
You held my head for a while
Said goodnight and flew away

I know why you make me so scared
You're all I can see
You speak and my hearing is impaired
You're all over me"
all over now,eric hutchinson,"Call me crazy if you've got it in you
But these people don't seem to mind
Sweet vermouth now you're telling me the truth
A little stubbornness will work out fine
A bottom feeder at the end of my rope
But i'm wondering where this rope began
Gonna circle around what i couldn't help bring down
It's just supply with demand
Nothing looks the same
Even when there's been no change
Say that something's gonna give
And it's all giving out on you

CHORUS
When it's all over now
It's all over now
It's no longer fun and it's all been overdone
So it's all over now

A large pickup truck with a little cargo towed
Gets from baker's to the laundromat
These daily fights all start to sound alike
I guess i'm gonna have to live with that
Short changed
Now it's getting even harder to identify the repetition
Short changed
Now it's getting even harder to identify the repetition
Will i simply peel away
Feels more likely everyday
Say that something's gonna give
And it's all giving out on you

CHORUS

And if you came here to tell me that you're sorry
For the pain you couldn't cause
Then save your breath and use it
Just to regain what you have lost and look at the cost"

When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a vulcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love

Lay your hand within my hand

I am the white dove for a soldier
Ever marching as to war
I would give my life to save you
I stand guarding at your door

Sinking quickly to the ground
I am a blind man for a watchdog
I am prime for giving in

The ships come in, it's Christmastime
The kids all holler carols 'cross the water
Stars that shine

Above the rooftops
The full moon dips its golden spoon
I wait on clip-clops, deer might fly
Why not? I met you

All that I want, all that I want

And when the night is falling
Down the sky at midnight
Another year is stalling
Far away a good bye, good night

All that I want., all that I want, all that I want

So small a turning
The world grows older every day
An ache, a yearning
Soften when I hear you say

All that I want, all that I want

And when the cold wind's blowing
Snow drifts through the pine trees
In houses lights are glowing
Likewise in your eyes that find me here

With all that I want.

Out in the harbor
The ships come in, it's Christmastime
It's Christmastime
It's Christmastime."

always tomorrow,gloria estefan,"Always Tomorrow
---------------

(Gloria Estefan)

I've been alone inside myself for far too long
Never really wanted it that way but I let it happen
If I could do it all again my life would be
Infinitely better than before I wouldn't waste a moment
(I'd) Make time for laughing with my friend
Make love, make music, make amends
Try to make a difference try to love, try to understand
Instead of just giving up I'd use the power at my command

Chorus
------
'Cause there's Always Tomorrow to start over again
Things will never stay the same the only one sure thing
Is change
That's why there's Always Tomorrow

I guess it took a little time, for me to see
The reason I was born into this world and what I'd have
To go through.
For I've finally realized that I could be
Infinitely better than before definitely stronger
I'll face whatever comes my way
Savor each moment of the day
Love as many people as I can along the way.
Help somone who's giving up if it's just to raise
My eyes and pray.

Chorus

Bridge

Before your last setting sun
And everything your heart has longed for
Has yet to be (one)
Yes there's Always Tomorrow though people come and they go
But if you've brought some love to their lives
Then you've got something to show

ANYTHING FOR YOU
----------------

(Gloria M.Estefan)

Anything for you
Though you're not here
Since you said we're through
It seems like years
Time keeps draggin on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong

I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though you'll never see me cryin'
You know inside I feel like dying

And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong
But don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye

I hope you find somone to please you
Somone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to

And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying
You know you'll never see me crying

Don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye

CAN'T STAY AWAY FROM YOU
------------------------

(Gloria M.Estefan)

Time flies
When you're having fun
I heard somebody say
But if all I've been is fun
Then baby let me go
Don't wanna be in your way
And I don't wanna be your second choice
Don't wanna be just your friend
You keep telling me that you're not in love
You wanna throw it all away

But I can't stay away form you
I don't wanna let you go
And thoughit's killing me that's true
There's just some things I can't control

Your love is slipping through my hands
And though I've heard it all before
I know you're telling me the truth
I know it's just no use
But I can't stay away from you

Hold on to every bit of hope, that's all I ever do
Hoping you might change your mind
And call me up to say how much you need
Me too
And though you're leaving me no other choice
That to utrn and walk away
Look over your shoulder, I'll be there
You can count on me to stay ...

'Cause I can't stay away from you
I don't wanna let you go
And though it's killing me that's true
There's just some things I can't control
Your love slipping through my hands
And though I've heard it all before

I know you're telling me the truth
I know it's just no use
But I can't stay away from you"

How am I supposed to breathe?
I try to relax, I touch your still frame
So I can watch you closer
And study the ways I believe I belong to you, to you
So I, I scratch at your waist line, your doll hair
I dig up the thought of how your eyes glow
So I make you my religion, my collision, my scapegoat
So have I found your secret weak spot, baby?

Can you pretend I'm amazing?
I can pretend I'm amazing...
Instead of what we both know
Instead of what we both know

I cut to the punch line baby
Can we pretend I'm amazing
Instead of what we both know

And now our history is for sale
And for that, I apologize
You see, you're my only know-how
The study of when I believed I belonged to you, to you
You see I've made you into something more delicious
My sweet ghost

Did God's will
While you were conquering America

May never sing your praises

How it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made

I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me
They're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around

Yeah, it hurts that you moved on

If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made

I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things

Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
Oh, and I love her"
angel eyes,paulini,"Hey you're looking good tonight
And every girl has got you in her sight
What you're doing with someone like me
Is surely one of life's little mysteries

So tonight I'll ask the stars above
How did I ever win your love?
What did I do, what did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?

Well I'm a girl who never learned to dance
Never even got one second glance
Across the crowded room was close enough
I could look but I could never touch

So tonight I'll ask the stars above
How did I ever win your love?
What did I do, what did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?

(Don't anyone wake me)
Don't anyone wake me if it's just a dream
('Cause it's the best thing)
'Cause it's the best thing that's ever happened to me
(All you ladies)
All you ladies you can look all you like
'Cause this guy you see, he's leaving here with me yeah-eh

So tonight I'll ask the stars above
How did I ever win your love?
What did I do, what did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way? yeah-eh

So tonight I'll ask the stars above
How did I ever win your love?
What did I do, what did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?

angeldust,strung out,"Broken angel you sway helpless through the desert wind
As your enemies they come to pick your bones
You're an anomaly so graced to be a lie you told in leisurely
A passing fascination with obituary eyes

So long to go
Before these alabaster hands ever let go

Meticulous in ritual you made a science of your pain
Where all your bleeding hearts and hungry minds
Divide along the way
So in love with all you could not be
Forever doomed to wonder aimlessly
Never really knowing all the pain you're gonna find

So long to go
Before these alabaster hands ever let go
Swaying in the California haze
In angel dust we all do blow away

We bleed this love alive
Straight faced to suicide
When do all these words mean anything?
What good will come of you and me?
Just growin' old and none the wiser
Fall apart and then your time to fall
Again get up again and on and on

Wasted breath in blackened lung and shortness of belief
Exercise your demons when you dream
The secrets that you keep inside are all you've ever known
Pay to ride and fuck to die reinvent another you

But that never stops that march right off the cliff in a single file
These angel wings could never take the weight of the fall
A question lost time a tasteless joke a secret smile
To fall apart and get up again and on again

We bleed this love alive
Straight faced to suicide
When do all these words mean anything?
What good will come of you and me?
Just growin' old and none the wiser
Fall apart and then your time to fall
Again get up again and on and on"
angels,elliott smith,"Someone's always coming around here
Trailing some new kill
Says ""I've seen your picture on a
Hundred-dollar bill""
What's a game of chance to you
To him is one
Of real skill

So glad to meet you, Angeles

Picking up the ticket shows there's
Money to be made
Go on, lose the gamble that's the
History of the trade
Did you add up all the cards left to play
To zero?

And sign up with evil, Angeles?
Don't start me trying now
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
'Cause I'm all over it, Angeles

I can make you satisfied in
Everything you do
All your secret wishes could right
Now be coming true
And be forever with my poison arms
Around you

No one's gonna fool around with us
No one's gonna fool around with us
So glad to meet you, Angeles"
angel,8mm,"Hush little angel, won't you try
The devil hears you when you cry
So you can't and you won't
Give up the gosth now
Leave it alone
You know you don't need those lessons
Someone else learned
It's your life
It's your right to burn

So you count and discount
All the cracks in the pavement
As you move about
You say that you'll take the push
For the sake of the pull
When you're deaf, dumb and blind
Your eyes don't feel the wool

And every time it's
Hush little angel, won't you try
The devil hears you when you cry
Hush little angel close your eyes
Think pleasant dreams and truer lies

It's not like those tales
Of glass and devotion
They like to sell
Oh you just want to be wanted
It's making you sick
But it's all right
Oh yeah, it's only a prick

And that's how you know
That it's bad
It's the problem with pain
It's just something to have
Oh, babe you're running the clock
Cuz, you can't make it stop
So just sit still
And hope the hammer won't drop

And every time it's...

Hush little angel, won't you try
The devil hears you when you cry
Hush little angel close your eyes
Think pleasant dreams and bluer skies
Angel don't you cry"

angles,dan le sac vs scroobius pip,"Things in life ain't always quite what they seem, there's more than one given angle to any one given scene.
So bear that in mind next time you try to intervene on any one given angle, on any one given scene.
My name is mark & I go to Uni & college
Don't socialise that much I just revise & build knowledge.
At times I find that I become a virtual recluse
I let my belt of interaction hang decisively loose
But I came here to learn and that's the life that I choose
So if people think that I'm a geek they can bring their abuse
See a lot of people think that I'm boring and say
That maybe I'm a weirdo or maybe I'm gay
But I don't care coz when I get a good job & good pay
I'll get a house for just my brother and me some day
And that's the reason I'm here, just to build for the future
And if it means better grades yeah I'd even sleep with my tutor
Things in life ain't always quite what they seem, there's more than
One given angle to any one given scene. So bear that in mind next
Time you try to intervene on any one given angle, on any one given scene.
My name is Paul & I've been a guard for 6 months
The shop that I guard is better than most dumps
That's why I like it here & my boss he's a pro
He's taught me tricks of the trade that other guards wouldn't know
I've learnt that in this game, there's some rules, you gotta bend
And not to forget these thieving pricks ain't your friend
And that appearance is key coz there's a message to send
And above all of that it's your fellow guards you defend.
The other day my boss was stabbed by some lowlife psycho
He's in hospital now so every night that's where I go
He's on the brink right now but he's showing no fear though
Coz if he dies there in bed he knows he's dying a hero.
Things in life ain't always quite what they seem, there's more than
One given angle to any one given scene. So bear that in mind next
Time you try to intervene on any one given angle, on any one given scene.
My name is Keith and I ain't so much a racist
But if one reached out a hand I'd decline their embraces
I work security in a shop in charge of 5 other guards
And I've got all of their respect coz I run this shit hard
I nicked one thief today; he didn't show enough respect & attention
So I grabbed him by the neck, see that's my form of redemption
I do no real harm; just make sure that it hurts
It ain't going by the book but believe me it works
Then I sent him on his way, that little shit knows the score now
Instil a little bit of fear. He won't darken my door now
And that's what I do. Stop these kids from decline.
Do what their parents wouldn't do, put down some boundaries & lines.
Things in life ain't always quite what they seem, there's more than
One given angle to any one given scene. So bear that in mind next
Time you try to intervene on any one given angle, on any one given scene.
My name is Billy & I've been beaten since I was 3
Mum died when I was born and dad takes it out on me
He ain't a bad man. He just gets drunk & feels alone
I tend to go for a walk, hope he's asleep when I get home.
I don't like to talk about it much coz like I said it ain't his fault
It only happens when he's drunk as a last resort
I wanted to get him a gift to show my support
But I had no money so I stole & I guess I got caught.
At times like that I kinda switch of my mind
Stare blankly into space and let what happens unwind
That seemed to anger this guard, he put his hands round my neck
He said it's time for me to learn some manners & respect
It hurt, but I've had worse before
But it made me realise life was just a series of wars
I went straight home that day and locked the bathroom door
Took a blade to both wrists, they won't hurt me no more.
Things in life ain't always quite what they seem, there's more than
One given angle to any one given scene. So bear that in mind
Next time you try to intervene on any one given angle, on any one given scene.
My name is Mark and today I was told my brother was dead
I returned from Uni and burst into tears on his bed
Under his pillow, I found his suicide note & I read
What had happened that day & what had fucked up his head.
The anger I felt right then there no words to express
I filled up with so much rage there was no way to digest
I grabbed a knife & walked to town, it was time to regress
Back to an eye for and eye, last breath for last breath
I went straight up to the counter & said I'd like to speak
To the guard that nicked my brother on Tuesday of this week
As the girl went through a door & disappeared out of sight
I put my hand in my pocket and I gripped the knife tight
This was it, as she pointed me out to the guard
My hand began to shake as held the knife so hard
Then as he approached me there was nothing to say
I stabbed that fucker eight times before they could take me away.
Things in life ain't always quite what they seem, there's more than
One given angle to any one given scene. So bear that in mind
Next time you try to intervene on any one given angle, on any one given scene."

Sie flüstern mir Zweifel tief in mein Herz
Was tu ich, warum und wofür?

Wann find ich die Antwort, der ich vertrau?

Could I borrow your lawnmower?

(Unintelligible) Up your body!
Why? Why me?
Why am I so lonely?

I'm an animal
I'm a sexual pervert, an animal
A living abortion

An animal, I'm your next door neighbour

Everybody hates me
Why am I so ugly?

Why am I so dirty?

I like peeping through holes in public lavatories
Domineering women in thigh-high boots
Tying me up, whipping me!

Somebody help me!

You degraded me
You twisted my mind
You made me unkind
You fed on my cravings
You persecuted me

animus,swans,"Somewhere, through the frozen fields,
Somewhere, beneath your pale and tender skin,
Lies a house, absorbing fear and pain -
Solar, Red, Contained -
And feeding on my dreams.
Somewhere cold, inside the optic wire,
Down where fingers and semen crack and bleed -
There I will be, with my arms spread out and broken,
Waiting for your breath, to animate my veins.
We're not alone: All our thoughts are numbered -
Malignant and cold, animal and hungry.
But I will contain all that ever was or will be,
Then I'll watch my skin erupt, in a symphony of flames -
Screaming out your name, screaming out your name...
Why can't I hide inside your halleable, electric face?
You'd suck away the pain, and swallow down my sickest dreams.
Now my body fgeels like snow, spilling out the shattered screen -
Where will we be then, when all the fear and blood are gone,
Drained into one hundred million open children's mouths -
Screaming out your name,
Screaming out your name..."

The answer lies in me

I cannot reach them

Bought and sold, and bought again
The dove is never free

Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering

The birth betrayed
The marriage spent
Yeah, and the widowhood
Of every government
Signs for all to see

I can't run no more
With that lawless crowd
While the killers in high places
Say their prayers out loud
But they've summoned, they've summoned up
A thundercloud
They're going to hear from me

Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in

You can add up the parts
But you won't have the sum
You can strike up the march
There is no drum
Every heart, every heart
To love will come
But like a refugee

Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in

Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in

That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in"
anymore,frank turner,"The single saddest thing that I ever heard you say
Was on the day I told you I had to go away.
You said ""Darling baby please, if you really mean to leave,
Can't I just hold you for a little while longer?""

And the single hardest thing I ever had to do
Was take your arms from round me and walk away from you.
And I know I shouldn't have kissed you as a I left,
Darling I should have been stronger.

Not with a bang but with a whimper.
It wasn't hard, it was kind of simple.
Three short steps from your bed to your door,
Darling I can't look you in the eyes now and tell you I'm sure
If I love you anymore.

I did my very best, I've given you these years
Of love and understanding, telephone calls and tears.
But now the little things you do that used to make me love you,
Now just cramp my heart a little and let it slip.

And we've met this sorry end from a picture perfect start,
The romance and the running down to disconnected hearts
Of two people sad and free, who know they used to be
More than just a pair of sinking ships.

I'm not drinking any more, but I'm then I'm not drinking any less.
I can't do this anymore, oh you know I did my best.
Oh my darling,
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore"

arcadia,narsilion,"A long time ago,
Deep inside the old world,
There was hidden a mystic land,
Filled with ancient woods
And deep lakes dreamed by the mother moon's embrace,
Who watched everything from the night's highest peaks...

The winds danced close to their memories
And the sunrises would cry endlessly,
Like golden tears,
Shed in the middle of the autumnal hug...

Dwelled by hundreds of magical creatures,
The land of the dreams,
Shined mesmerized.
Enchanted for a long time,
Being remembered forever,
Under the name of Arcadia...

Mother, wind, Arcadia...
Legend, nature, Arcadia...
Dance, essence, Arcadia...
Lost, wisdom. Arcadia...
Woodland, silence, Arcadia...
Dream, silver, Arcadia..."

And in June, reformed without me

astronaut,amanda palmer,"Is it enough to have some love
Small enough to slip inside a book
Small enough to cover with your hand
Because everyone around you wants to look

It is enough to have some love
Small enough to slip inside the cracks
The pieces don't fit together so good
With all the breaking and all the gluing back

And i am still not getting what i want
I want to touch the back of your right arm
I wish you could remind me who i was
Because every day I'm a little further off

But you are, my love, the astronaut
Flying in the face of science
I will gladly stay an afterthought
Just bring back some nice reminders

And is it getting harder to pretend
That life goes on without you in the wake
And can you see the means without the end
In the random frantic action that we take

And is it getting easy not to care
Despite the many rings around your name
It isn't funny and it isn't fair
You've traveled all this way and it's the same

But you are, my love, the astronaut
Flying in the face of science
I will gladly stay an afterthought
Just bring back some nice reminders
And i would tell them anything to see you split the evening
But as you see i do not have an awful lot to tell
Everybody's sick for something that they can find fascinating
Everyone but you and even you aren't feeling well

But you are, my love, the astronaut
Flying in the face of science
I will gladly stay an afterthought
Just bring back some nice reminders

Yes you are, my love, the astronaut
Crashing in the name of science
Just my luck they sent your upper half
It's a very nice reminder
It's a very nice reminder

And you may be acquainted with the night
But I have seen the darkness in the day
And you must know it is a terrifying sight
Because you and i are living the same way"

A thrill like I have never known, oh
When you smile, when you smiled at me
That's how the spell was cast
And now here we are in heaven
I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to

at this moment,billy vera & the beaters,"What did you think
I would do at this moment
When you're standing before me
With tears in your eyes
Trying to tell me
That you have found you another
And you just don't love me no more

What did you think
I would say at this moment
When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you
'Cause you just don't love me no more

Did you think
I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you
Now come on you know me too well
How could I hurt you
When darling I love you
And you know
I'd never, never hurt you-oo-wo-oo...

What do you think
I would give at this moment
If you'd stay
I'd subtract twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees
And kiss the ground that you walk on
If I could just hold you again

I'd fall down on my knees
I'd kiss the ground that you walk on baby
If I could just hold you

If I,
Could just hold you
If I,
If I could just hold-hold you,
Again"

You asked me not to speak, then kissed me on the cheek
You said that i was wrong, you said that i was weak
I tried to think a while you said it was too long
And when i tried to smile you sung this pretty song:
Drink this baby, it's atomic soda.
It'll blow your mind back to how it was.
Drink this baby, it's atomic soda.
It'll blow your mind back to how it was.
Standing in the snow, icicles on your nose,
I felt what once was through your frozen clothes.
Standing on the shore, looking at the lake
My arms around you won't stop you shake.
Drink this baby, it's atomic soda.
It'll blow your mind back to how it was.
Drink this baby, it's atomic soda.
It'll blow your mind back to how it was.

In the wintertime when the leaves are gone
I look at you and wonder what's wrong.
You were so strong, i was so weak.
Now i can't even get you to speak.
Drink this baby, it's atomic soda.
It'll blow your mind back to how it was.

Remember the good times
Remember me sleeping by your side
Remember the feeling
That you were safe in my arms
I still see sons in you
My sons of sons in your eyes

And set sail for better times

atrophy,the antlers,"You've been living a while in the front of my skull
Making orders
You've been writing me rules, shrinking maps
And redrawing borders
I've been repeating your speeches
But the audience just doesn't follow
'Cause I'm leaving out words
Punctuation and it sounds really hollow
I've been living in bed
Because now you tell me to sleep
I've been hiding my voice and my face
And you decide when I eat
In your dreams I'm a criminal
Horrible, sleeping around
While you're awake, I'm impossible
Constantly letting you down

Little porcelain figurines
Glass bullets you shoot at the wall
Threats of castration for crimes
You imagine when I miss your call
With the bite of the teeth
Of that ring on my finger
I'm bound to your bedside
Your eulogy singer
I'd happily take all those bullets inside you
And put them inside of myself

Someone, oh anyone
Tell me how to stop this
She's screaming, expiring
And I'm her only witness
I'm freezing, infected
And rigid in that room inside her
No one's gonna come
As long as I lay still in bed beside her"

autonomy,cire,"This choke hold is driving me away from your world.
Far from complying, I'm so drenched in spite,
I'd chew off my own feet before stepping in line.
Crawl back out to be pushed down.
Come lay down to be dissolved...

(chorus)
Once again you waste what little time we have,
setting limits on a bright and open future,
fueling me with a wealth of cold dissent
and dreams of our extinction.

Keep both eyes away from the damage,
and it is so easy to hide from your mistakes.
He crawls back out to be pushed down.
He won't lay down to be dissolved.

(chorus)

Afraid of being replaced,
the old turn into barricades shouting praises of control.

(break)

Cutting all connection to your reasoning.
Clutching to this failed methodology.
Rebellion is the bastard of conformity.
Choose to step in line or choose your misery.

Choose your misery..."
autumn,carla bruni,"There is a wind where the rose was
Cold rain where sweet grass was
And clouds like sheep, stream o'er the steep
Grey skies where the lark was
Where the lark was

Naught gold where your hair was
Naught warm where your hand was
But phantom's forlorn beneath the thorn
Your ghost where your face was
Where your face was

Sad winds where your voice was
Tears, tears where my heart was
And ever with me, child, ever with me
Silence where hope was
Where hope was

There is a wind where the rose was
There is a wind where the rose was"

Saving up for someday
But what does someday mean?

And you, you look like freedom
You look like the avalanche I need
The avalanche I need

And there's a road, leads away from here
And every day I stand in place and watch it disappear
And there's a bird, circles in my mind
Security's the whore in me that never lets me fly
And you, you look like freedom
And you, you look like change
You look like the avalanche I need
The avalanche I need

With your sunburned soul
And your hunger for the road
I'm snowblind and I'm crying after
Like nothing else matters
When you go down take me
When you go down, yah, make me
I got a hunger you could feed

And I know it's a fine line divides
The place I'm looking for and what's inside
And I know it's a long, long way
Through the outskirts of everyday
And you, you look like freedom, you look like change
You look like the avalanche I need
The avalanche I need

Yes the picture's changing, every moment

残酷な運命を与えて喜んでいる

暖かい部屋に帰れば
愛しい人がそこにいて
夢ばかりで生きているあたしに
何ができるというの?

Sucking out screams in stereo
Before my very eyes
I saw her drowning

Keep my daughter in a jar
She can't get out she won't go far
Her heart is in my mouth
But still keep pounding

That i don't even recall
If we ever kissed

I still have your records
I still have those tapes you'd made
Of all your favorite songs
But i just can't quite bring myself
To put em on

And maybe it's too late for that now

I still have the letter you wrote
Sitting on my steps
Waiting for me to come home
On the night
That i did not come home
And i still have the letter where you said
Those words i'd waited for
Since the day we met

Maybe it's too late for that now
Maybe i fucked it all up somehow
But i wrote my name on your arm in blue

Bring her home tonight""
And I heard you was graciously put on
I just laughed and said, ""Good night""
Guess it's alright

Are asking when your love is gonna show
And who knows why the love you need will always pass you by
Well, I heard it's true, your love is gonna grow

So let me know, 'cause I can stay or honey, I can go
Just to wherever you tell me so
And find my place there, and there I'll stay

Well, they said you was burned out, I just laughed
And said, ""Come on, she's not burned, she's just gone""
And it took me too long 'til I found out
Faces that you know the best, oh well, I guess
And they laughed when you said you was leaving
Everybody knows you well 'cept for me, can't you tell?

We're just babblin' on and on
Babylon, babblin' on and on

Caught in Bel Air with Chippy and Biffy
And someone says, hey guys, you want some sniffy?
On the trigger was a punch and we put a spanish fly
Biffy's without spot and Chippy's on my tigh

Shut up!

No we wont' shut up
We're just babblin' on and on
Babylon, babblin' on and on

Pussycat shut up! You boys, you're disgusting
Shut up!

Yeah, shut the fuck up..."
baby,ariel pink's haunted graffiti,"When we out in the moonlight
Lookin' up at the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you
Holding hands and making love
Oooh baby
You're so baby
Oooh baby
You're so baby
Sandy beach, was makin' love
As a tide moves in on us
Feels so good walking side by side
Wanna be with you all my life
Ooh baby
You're so baby
Ooh baby
You're so baby
Ooh baby
You're so baby
Dreams of you all the time
Feel so good I want to get that right
Just can't wait till tomorrow
Come on baby let's shake it
Ooh baby
You're so baby
Ooh baby
You're so baby
Ooh baby
You're so baby
When we're out in the moonlight
Looking up at the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you
Holding hands and making love

back home,cold,"When she walks into the room
They look up to see her face
All the glitter falls on her
And the room's her stage

Don't you think you've had enough
Do their claws make sores
Take my hand and come away
And I'll take you home

I won't turn around
Can't be afraid
Takin' you all the way back home
Innocence gone
Can't be the same
Takin' you all the way back home
Back home

Will the world still be the same
Even if you're gone
When the pillars start to fade
And the room's just walls

Don't you think you've had enough
Do their claws make sores
Take my hand and come away
And I'll take you home

I won't turn around
Can't be afraid
Takin' you all the way back home
Innocence gone
Can't be the same
Takin' you all the way
All the way
All the way

Don't you think you've had enough
What's the gun there for
Take my hand and fly away
And I'll take you home

Don't you think you've had enough
What's the gun there for
Take my hand and come away
And I'll take you

I won't turn around
Can't be afraid
Take you all the way back home
Innocence gone
Can't be the same
Take you all the way

I'll take you all the way
I'll take you all the way back
I'll take you all the way
I'll take you all the way back

I'll take you all the way
I'll take you all the way

back in the day,zach gill,"Back in the day, like my grandma used to say
She was a single mom, raising my mom
With the money she made
Working in a beauty salon
Her husband was gone, and her plans got changed
Still she did the best she could
Back in the day

Cause it's her eyes, and she gets so far away
She's talking at the floor
Your grand-daddy bought me that piano
After he came home from the war
You know the world keeps getting stranger
But I still feel the same
I love you now like I loved you then

Back in the day
I had a pair of kangaroos
Not the animals, but the tennis shoes
Kept my lunch money in a pocket on the side
I was convinced that the shoes made me jump high
I guess it was because of the name
Still I loved the idea just the same

Cause it's her eyes, and she gets so far away
Feels more like a dream
That's your daddy with a moustache
That's your mommy being free
You know the world keeps getting stranger
But I still feel the same
I love you now like I loved you then

Afgahn rugs and tapestries
Made from memories and dreams
Growing old or growing young
I'll hold you in my heart
(?)

Cause it's her eyes, and she gets so far away
She's talking at the floor
Your grand-daddy bought me that piano
After he came home from the war
You know the world keeps getting stranger
But I still feel the same
I love you now like I loved you then

You know I need you now like I needed you then
You know I love you now like I loved you then

Like I loved you
Back in the day"
back to you,john mayer,"Back to you
It always comes around, back to you
I tried to forget you, I tried to stay away
But it's too late

Over you
I'm never over, over you
There's something about you
It's just the way you move
The way you move me

Yeahhh, I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit every game I play
But forgive me, love
I can't turn and walk away, this way

Back to you
It always comes around, back to you
I walk with your shadow
I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette

Yeahhh, should have smiled in that picture
If it's the last that I'll see of you
It's the least that you
Could not do

Leave the light on
I'll never give up on you
Leave the light on
For me too, for me too
For me too (Yeah)

Back to me
I know that it comes back to me
Doesn't it scare you
Your will is not as strong
As it used to be"
backstabber,jonezetta,"You're sorry
You said it yourself and we believe you
No we really do!
And now no one is going to save you now

No one is going to save you now

Backstabber! Backstabber! Backstabber!
When you're in disguise
Backstabber! Backstabber! Backstabber!

And now you're laughing
'Cause they laugh at you
You scream out to all the empty pews
And now no one is going to save you now

Now go and pray to your God inside
If you never knew little boy it's you
You can't use me
You won't use me

backyard,natasha bedingfield,"It's been too long
Don't think I've seen you smile
At me for quite a while
And we're too busy doing things
We haven't noticed what's missing

Where's the fun we used to have?
My childish ways and your sarcasm
Silly jokes and fairy tales
Where did we leave them?
Lost in the backyard

Your lasso, my tiara
My wand, your plastic bazooka
Why can't we be how we were in the backyard?
Your cowboy hat, my tutu
You hide and seek, I catch you
Why can't we be how we were
In the backyard, in the backyard?

Simple days of hand in hand
And drawing our names in the sand
Somehow life just complicates
Our buried treasure, it just waits
Lost, in the backyard

Your lasso, my tiara
My wand, your plastic bazooka
Why can't we be how we were in the backyard?
Your cowboy hat, my tutu
You hide and seek, I catch you
Why can't we be how we were
In the backyard, in the backyard?

In the backyard
Lost in the backyard
Lost you in my backyard
Lost in the backyard

You can still meet me in the garden
You and I
And hide behind the roses bed
You and I, you and I
Lost in the backyard again

Your lasso, my tiara
My wand, your plastic bazooka
Why can't we be how we were in the backyard?
Your cowboy hat, my tutu
You hide and seek, I catch you
Why can't we be how we were
In the backyard, in the backyard?"
bad day (album version),daniel powter,"Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away

And I don't need no carryin' on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
And tell me your life's been way offline
You're falling to pieces every time

And I don't need no carryin' on

'Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, ""Don't lie""
You work at a smile, and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down, and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say

And I don't need no carryin' on

You had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, ""Don't lie""
You work at a smile, and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down, and you really don't mind
You had a bad day

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back, and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong, yeah

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves, and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, ""Don't lie""
You work at a smile, and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, you've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time?
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Ah, had a bad day
Ah, had a bad day
Ah, had a bad day
Ah..."
bad days,the flaming lips,"You're sorta stuck where you are
But, in your dreams you can buy expensive cars
Or live on mars
And have it your way

And you hate your boss at your job
Well in your dreams you can blow his head off
In your dreams
Show no mercy

And all your bad days will end
And all your bad days will end
You have to sleep late when you can
And all your bad days will end

And all your bad days will end
And all your bad days will end
You have to sleep late when you can
And all your bad days will end"

Lately, Lady

Make me crazy, don't speak no sound
I want you to prove it to me in the nude
Addicted to the way you move

Honey, if anything ever should change in you
Don't worry I'm standing still
I'll move in with the right of will

This is the highest cost, take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost, will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town, drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around, will you forgive me?

I can't control the feeling girl 'cause I know you're here
I feel you from the floor to the ceiling
Girl, I feel you when you comb your hair

Lady when we lock it low we get together, it's an overdose
I'm slipping, I'm here, I'm on my knees
I feel my heart's about to explode

This is the highest cost, take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost, will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town, drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around, will you forgive me?

Baby to tell the truth when I'm sober I jones for you
When it's over I'm overdue
Girl there's no one as bad, no one as bad as you

You got me, you got me
You got me slippin' around with it, around with it, oh why?
You got me sick with this love baby
I'm so, I'm so in love, I can't come down

This is the highest cost, take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost, will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town, drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around, will you forgive me?

You're my bad habit baby, you're my
You're takin' my soul down to the letter O
Can't escape the way you got me locked out baby
I gotta break from you, break from you, break from you

This is the highest cost, take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost, will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town, drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around, will you forgive me?
Will you forgive me? Will you forgive me?
Will you forgive me? Will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town, drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around, will you forgive me?
I can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
I can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
I can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
I can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling

Bad man, he's commin' for you

To be a rich man with many maids
He's got eyes like hand grenades
He had a good woman
Palm of his hand
Until she left him for another man

Bad, bad man
Your a bad, bad man
You gotta' do what you can
When you're a bad man

He's a bad man and that's the truth
The devil's law don't need no proof
A jealous man .All alone
A motel room is not a home
Helpless man, he fell ill
Was prescribed a fatal pill
Now he's a dead man
His heart's still black
His only love stabbed him in the back

bang bang,dispatch,"She woke me up with a bang, bang
Looking' over cross eyed had a big
Hunch that the world was a big lie
When I got up all the blood to my head
I got so dizzy fell back into my bed
I went over to the way side
Looking for the high tide
What will I find will I find will I find
All I saw was a man that had a hat
That had a pom-pom he's been there for
Years can someone tell me how long
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
You see this woman woke me up at a quarter to three
And I didn't know it then
But she put a spell on me
Said I had to go down to where the cliffs meet the sea
And meet an old man to present my plea
So I headed way down to the big pier
To await and confront my big fear
I wheeled around behind to my blindside
To find an old man with a lime and a kind eye
Said mister, mister with your beard so long
Won't you be a saint and tell me
Just where I'm going
He pointed to a conk shell and then to the lime
And said this is all I really need to get by
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Hey mister man
I know you don't know who you think I think I am
But I can safely say
That I should've been sleeping, been sleeping, been sleeping , been sleeping
The day away
Hey hey
I said scuse me, have you got the time
He shrugged his shoulders said get a spine
Coconut hit me on the head jonesin' for a fig
I got booked last night, I need another fix, dick
Yeah, just then I see a twinkle twinkle
In the old man's eye and a wave
Tossed bottle is thrown to the sky
I caught it on the rebound
It landed with a soft sound
I took out the message and put the bottle down
Inside was the antidote to the spell
And I read it to the man 'cause he couldn't read so well
Said don't worry about a thing you know you path is true
Just ease your mind have a banana or two
Well goodness, goodness, woe is me
The man nearly flipped to learn that he was free
But just before we Left and started kicking it
I picked up the bottle and star sixed it
Kick kick shuffle shuffle back to the beach
With a tune on my lips and my quest in reach
If that woman comes to you with her song so sweet
Say damn, let the poor sucker sleep
Let him sleep
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find"

Ah, ha
This type of flower y'all

Blessings blessings
Yessings yessings
I'll give you want
If you give me what I need
Time to say grace
Take your place
To the human race

Yo yo it go
Ever am I jamming
My flip stay congested
Clinically tested
Certified pure
Gaining more ground than the floor
Before you knew shite
I kicked down your front door
We put drums and b-lines
And stain your inner mind
Boldly you are struck with this Rootique design
See I don't
Know no better
Than to keep my shit deep
Ticking over time till my week end my sleep
I shun the ways of all sheep-like types
When I grips mics you get pure blessed strength
Heaven sent, making heathens repent
Push your bad shit back
Here comes the baptism
Don't key nuff his instant composition (?)
And there'll be no backsliding in my church
'Cause I hurt like the truth
Check my magazine
Any which way heathens must get redeemed

Before you get the wrong idea
Here's something I got to make clear
The ex-experts with the expertise
Ain't got no place over here

Before you get the wrong
Start acting wrong strong
If you ever catch me dancing on a table top
In a thong, in a seedy dive
Looking sad like my stuff's gone wrong
Yeah, for now I look focussed, diligent, strong
Point is to make me warn ya
That you never know quite what's around the corner
See, if I had the gift of foresight
Wishing I could tell you, babe, that it'll be all right
But don't forget to live up in the hear and now
While you thinking 'bout the year two thou'
For the future don't be scared
Be prepared to stop chase the chattels and the vanity
Get in touch with your soul and spirituality
Before the full calamity is here, my dear
My fire's still burning like a spear

We make it blouse not clear

Over here. Over where?
I stay pensive
Keep my flex of trashion expensive
Dem A&R stay anally retentive
You tink how I step fras I just
Deal with the matter put my heart pon plate
White labels in a suitcase
Photocopies of some spiel and my black face
I'm on the corner of East Street
Yelling, rag and bones style
Greet the man's with a spud
Greet the skeets with a smile
Frig 'em all, here stands the heart, the balls
So if you truly sick and tired of the bullshite hype
Back a local man and make a stand
Sing nah
We don't wannabe, we just be
We most uncouth, we un-PC
Kick the sand in your face
The ace is mine
Travelcard in my pocket running under the Thames
Heading North of the river to collect two ends
It go

More deep than space number 9

I'm not an open book that you can rifle through
The cold hard truth that you see right to
I'm just basket case without you

He's not a magic man or a perfect fit
But had a steady hand and I got used to it
And a glass cage heart and invited me in
And now I'm just a basket case without him

You're beggin' for the truth
So I'm sayin' it to you
I've been saving your place
And what good does it do?
Now I'm just a basket case
Now I'm just a basket case

I don't say much and it'll stay that way
You got a steel train touch and I'm just a track you lay
So I'll stay right here underneath you
I'm just a basket case and that's what we do

You're beggin' for the truth
So I'm sayin' it to you
I've been saving your place
And what good does it do?
Now I'm just a basket case

Won't somebody come on in and tug at my seams?
Oh, send your armies in of robbers and thieves
To steal the state I'm in, I don't want it anymore

You're beggin' for the truth
So I'm sayin' it to you

bastard,ben folds,"The old bastard left his ties and a suit
A brown box, moth balls and bowling shoes
And his opinion so you never have to choose
Pretty soon, you'll be an old bastard, too

You get smaller while the world gets big
The more you know you know you don't know shit
""The Whiz Man"" will never fit you like ""The Whiz Kid"" did

So why you gotta act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything
Why you gotta act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything

Close your eyes, close your ears, young man
You've seen and heard all an old man can
Spread the facts on the floor like a fan
Throw away the ones that make you feel bad

Kids today are getting old too fast
They can't wait to grow up so they can kiss some ass
They get nostalgic 'bout the last ten years
Before the last ten years have passed

So why you gotta act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything
Why you gotta act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything

Tears land on a hand on a chest
The old bastard had a paradigm arrest

He got smaller and the world got big
The more he knew he knew he didn't know shit
""The Whiz Man"" never fit him like ""The Whiz Kid"" did

be free,king dude,"Last night I was free outside in the field
Where we both fell in love then I knew it was real
You put me outside, I was singing a song
You looked to the window, but I was already gone

The willows were weeping, licking like tongues
And the skin like the heaven's, clouds in our lungs
I saw my reflection, and I talked to the glass
I think about you and I think of the past

If you wanna be free, don't think about me
Don't you look in my eyes, don't you hang around me no more
The thing that you want is what is killing me
Don't you dare take my hand if you wanna be free, oh no

Your face like a painting in your historic mind
But you barely survived, and you're barely alive
Those rules of lost days that we buried in time
I carried the baby, it felt dead inside

Well, you carried my child, I planted my seed
I know it was wrong, but you know what I need
You saw it in my eyes when you were looking at me
You keep darkening my doorway, your love sets me free, oh

If you wanna be free, don't think about me
Don't you look in my eyes, don't you hang around me no more
And the thing that you want is the thing that's killing me
Don't you dare take my hand if you wanna be free, oh no"

But with a gang of me you'll be on your toes

I consider you, I consider you
I consider you

For a bit of skirt you do go my way
Singing to the sky, oh like a bird of prey

I consider you, I consider you
I consider you

Let's go tonight
Let the beast run a mile
With the dogs and the cattle
Let's go
I know you've said
It's like a heel to the head
Or a girl in your bed and your arms

For the butter on your bread
For the dying and the dead
For your cheeks turning red
Let's go
Let's go tonight
Let the beast run a mile
With the dogs and the cattle
Let's go"
beautiful blue,holly mcnarland,"Verse 1:
From the picture on the wall
To the bed post that touched them all
This is where I live
This is where I do my screamin'
How do you say I love you in so many other ways?
This is where I live
This is what I do best

Chorus:
Dreamin' with so much ugliness
Wakin' up to all this beautiful blue

Verse 2:
From the time I walked in
To the point that we're both arguin'
This is how I live there

How do you say I've always felt this way?
That is where I live

Have no fear
The monster's gone
He's on the run and your daddy's here

Every day in every way
It's getting better and better

Out on the ocean
Sailing away
I can hardly wait
To see you come of age
But I guess we'll both just have to be patient

'Cause it's a long way to go
A hard row to hoe
Yes it's a long way to go
But in the meantime

Before you cross the street
Take my hand
Life is what happens to you
While you're busy making other plans

Beautiful child
You are a beautiful child
And I am a fool once more

You fell in love when I was only ten
The years disappeared
Much has gone by since then
I bite my lip, can you send me away?
You touch I have no choice,I have to stay
Ooh, I had to stay
Ooh, I had to stay

Sleepless child
There is so little time
Your eyes say yes, but you don't say yes
Well, I wish that you were mine
I wish that you were mine

You say it will be harder in the morning
I wait for you to say, just go
Your hands held mine, so few hours
But I'm not a child anymore

I'm not a child anymore
I'm tall enough to reach for the stars
I'm old enough to love you from afar
Too trusting, yes,but then women usually are
(I'm not a child anymore),I'm not a child, oh no
(I'm tall enough to reach for the stars)
I will do as I'm told
(I'm old enough to love you, from afar)
Even if I never hold you again(Too trusting yes, but then women usually are)

Hold you again
(Hold you),sleepless child
There is so little time
(I will do as I'm told)
Your eyes say yes but you don't say yes

I wish that you were mine

beautiful disaster,jon mclaughlin,"She loves her mama's lemonade
Hates the sound that goodbyes make
She prays one day she'll find someone to need her
She swears that there's no difference
Between the lies and compliments
It's all the same if everybody leaves her

And every magazine tells her she's not good enough
The pictures that she sees make her cry

She would change everything, everything, just ask her
Caught in the in-between, a beautiful disaster
She just needs someone to take her home

She's given boys what they want
Tries to act so nonchalant
Afraid they'll see that she's lost her direction
She never stays the same for long
Assuming that she'll get it wrong
Perfect only in her imperfection

She's not a drama queen
She doesn't want to feel this way
Only 17 but tired, yeah

She would change everything for happy ever after
Caught in the in-between, a beautiful disaster
She just needs someone to take her home

'Cause she's just the way she is
But no one's told her that's okay

She would change everything, everything, just ask her
Caught in the in-between, a beautiful disaster
She would change everything for happy ever after
Caught in the in-between, a beautiful disaster
She just needs someone to take her home

She just needs someone to take her home"
beautiful lie,yoav,"Yesterday, today, tomorrow
Fade away like frozen photographs
Remember, forget
The stakes, the ways you take
The ways you make the moments pass

Forever regret, I tell a beautiful lie
And I would die if you find out
I tell a beautiful lie
Every time that I did not open up my mouth

All the same, it's a game, it's a play, it's a war
It's a shame that we're always fighting for
I don't mean to cast no blame
I don't intend to pretend
I can never loved you more

But in the blink of an eye
Everything you ever knew can change
And it's a beautiful lie
If you think everything will always stay the same

Babe, my babe
You got a secret, it's starting to show
My babe, sweet lady
How long can you keep it?
How far would you go?

You tell a beautiful lie
You tell a beautiful lie
And it's going to
It's going to drive you crazy

Babe, my babe

beautiful machine,alina simone,"Hot sand, the smell of diesel
On the back of my hand
The map is fading and the
Photographs blow out in a string of flares
Strike a match and burn
Through the season
We'll all go down with
The sun-drenched heathens
Dancing as the lanterns
Softly sway

I want to feel love
Get caught in the echo chamber
I want to get crushed
In the beautiful machine

Oh, the coastline is ghostly
The lighthouse on the hill
Cold and still
The shore keeps getting closer
To the highway
The ocean is closing in
Cold and still

Signal fades, accelerate
The stars are cold and hard
Reflected in the water
Where an Exxon sign blinks on
And on...

I want to feel love
Get caught in the echo chamber
I want to get crushed
In the beautiful machine
Kaleidoscope collapses
Brings me up to the rapture
I want to get caught
In the beautiful machine"
beautiful night,the go find,"I was wondering what's the commotion
Then I got a little bit closer
I saw the weeping boy
Crying rivers filled with joy

He ran away
Across the street
Into the moonlit night
He wept his tears and sang songs about leaving town

He should have known
That what was wrong would never leave him behind
As he stopped he found out
Headed back into his town
But got lost into tonight
The most beautiful night of them all

Beautiful
Beautiful night
Walk me home
Beautiful
Beautiful night
Walk me home

I was wondering what's the commotion
Then I got a little bit closer
I saw the weeping boy
Crying rivers filled with joy"
beautiful one,the cardigans,"Rise in the morning
Shine 'til the dawning
Smooth dreams in leaves
Raised in a teacup
Sticked down to sleep
Like an envelope
Filled up with words for you
Wrapped up in curls
Sweet as the summer
Cheek soft as a fur
Grace in a slumber
Beautiful wonderboy
Soft beams from an early sun
On my truly beautiful one
Shimmer from a Saturday sun
On my truly beautiful one
Rise in the morning
Shine 'til the dawning
Right up from sleep
Lost in the blankets
Tasting like salt
Roses an' candy bars
Coffee an' oval cigars
Stretched out to breathe
Down from the rooftops
Sticked down to sleep
Like an envelope
Filled up with words for you
Soft beams from an early sun
On my truly beautiful one
Shimmer from a Saturday sun
On my truly beautiful one
Rise in the morning

beautiful people,big country,"If beauty is an ecstasy and anger keeps you poor
A hungry man is never free, a rich man never cured
Things were never what they used to be
Now every crowd has its silver lining, we all got stuff to sell
And you may live your life so bitter, but you remember it so well
Things were never what they used to be
For all the folks who can run the world, drive cabs or cut your hair
And the sun may set without your help, but you're beautiful people to me
You may fall before you're pushed, but it's beautiful people I see
If you only see the stars when it's dark, that's enough for me
An empty soul with a full opinion is beautiful people to me
It's all the same in different hats, the proof of the missing link
A nation talking to itself and none of us can think
Things were never what they used to be
For a silent fool may still be wise, there's no way you can tell
And the captain more scared than his crew is beautiful people to me
And the finest government you could buy, it's beautiful people I see
If you live five to one against, it's good enough for me

Can't use two steps to cross a canyon, you're beautiful people to me
If you don't see the same trees I see, you're beautiful people to me
Make deserts bloom and oceans die, just beautiful people to me
If you're lost and dying of civilization, that's enough for me
If you believe your own blind eye, you're beautiful people to me
And you may miss what you never had and have what you don't need
And the sun may set without your help, but you're beautiful people to me
You may fall before you're pushed, but it's beautiful people I see
If you only see the stars when it's dark, that's enough for me
An empty soul with a full opinion is beautiful people to me
And the captain more scared than his crew is beautiful people to me
And the finest government you could buy, it's beautiful people I see
If you live five to one against, it's good enough for me
Can't use two steps to cross a canyon, you're beautiful people to me
If you don't see the same trees I see, you're beautiful people to me

If you're lost and dying of civilization, that's enough for me"
beautiful,aimee mann,"You pulled up and parked your El Dorado
We said ""hi"" and kissed with some bravado
I got out my camera and was laughing
Happy it was you I'm photographing

And we drove to the ferry
Like the cat and canary
I said, ""Baby, it's scary
When it's so beautiful

Why does it hurt me
To feel so much tenderness?
Beautiful
You little wonder, you""

Maybe then I held your hand and kissed you
I know once I just hauled off and hit you

'Cause I can't even stand it
'Cause I don't want to end it
To be perfectly candid –
Baby, you're beautiful

Sometimes it hurts me
To feel so much tenderness
Beautiful
Wish you could see it, too

And all I have to do today
Is make you happy
The only thing you have to say
Is, ""It's all lovely, baby""

Late that night, we checked into the Bellevue
Held you close, but, baby – couldn't tell you

And we stayed in our Calvins
And we swore we'd be best friends
And I looked through the zoom lens
And thought you were beautiful

Sometimes it hurts me
To feel so much tenderness
Beautiful
Baby, I'm dazzled
By the view
Beautiful
You don't need to tell me
I'm completely powerless

I wish you could see it, too
I wish you could see it, too

In the coming of your smile
So I swear if you ever come 'round again
Please, stay for a while

because of you,kelly clarkson,"Ooh, ooh, ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep (I watched you die, in your sleep)
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me (I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain (You never saw me)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life, because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you (ooh)
Because of you (ooh, ooh)"

bees,laura cantrell,"See the sign of the old hotel, we used to stay there
Empty and threadbare, water running cold
Searched the streets for old friends, met only strangers
None who remember, none who would take me home

I miss the bees, I miss the honey
I miss them humming by the flowered vine
My time is short now, I feel it coming
I'll see you darling in the morning light

Spent an hour in the waiting room of our old headquarters
None brought my orders I rode on alone
With my portrait missing from their hall of honor
No frame to claim me in silver black and gold

Lost in the afternoon missing an hour or two
Turn the crystal set never failed me yet
No voice to say goodbye, tears on my face have dried
I'll be coming through on that wavelength a heart can tune

I miss the bees, I miss the honey
I miss them humming by the flowered vine
My time is short now, I feel it coming
I'll see you darling in the morning light

No voice to say goodbye, tears on my face have dried
I'll be coming through on that wavelength a heart can tune

To take control and be set free

Make the space so we can grow
Save us before I let you go

Better for you, her, or me?
Well I don't know what to tell ya

It's not my fault that I don't believe
Cause you're still so stuck in that life
And I refuse to stay on this ride
Cause we're goin' round in circles

Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

I'm a little bit sheltered
I'm a little bit scared
I'm a little bit nervous
I'm going nowhere
I'm a little bit jealous
I'm a little bit slow
I'm a little bit hurtful
And I don't wanna let it go

No, and I don't wanna let it go

I'm a little bit angry, when everyone's around
But I get a little lonely, when no one's out
I feel my demons
Misleading me

I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

Maybe when I get older
And I'm in the ground
The weights off my shoulders it was bringing me down (down)
I've never been that lucky I've never tasted fame (fame)
I'm always looking for something but I hate changin'
Time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

It doesn't matter what is out there
My head is spinning and it won't bail out
It doesn't matter what is out there
'Cause time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

beside,jon & vangelis,"I have seen the compass turning
Round and round my heart
The senses are yearning
For a possible change of heart
That is coming to you
Coming to you

You stand upright
You are different
Why the spinal shock, the fusion, the evil
Spill it out on the floor of belief
Come and mend this design
Come and mend this design
With every right we do

I have seen the sun, this sounds crazy
The story 'bout boy in the rain
He was standing waiting for for the light
As though he did have a reason to know
Did he really know?

His eyes were open, they expected someone
In his heart he felt the compass was turned on
I will echo Ho! for the reasons that change me

Every thought though it takes so long
Is mastered with every plan
It would seem there's no end
To the bad or the goodness in man

So my friend it seems the weariest night
Just leads to a heavenly dawn
Should we see so much in every time we sigh?

Even this we could call music
As that would match my body connection
Let me take your hand
I will be beside you
Beside

He took so much a lot of my mind
I can't help believing what is sublime
Is this fate again and again?
Yes

Am I taught to love above every reason
Everyone, every season?
The compass will turn and turn again
Turn again

And turn again"
best friend,pharrell,"Yeah, yep
Spit my gum out right now, yeah
What up world? Got my inspiration in the studio with me tonight, feelin' good
Got a lot to smile about
Talk to y'all niggas
Yessir, hey

My best friend say I'm bottled up, I need a fucking therapist
But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with
Why should I open up on somebody else's carelessness...
[Pop] there goes the top, nigga, so here it is
Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets
Imagine 10 years old full of doubt and defeat
Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceit
My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, you about what you wheap
She used to help me with my homework, addiction-subtraction
Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted
Wanna skip ya mind from crying better learn something, son
You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums?
Look, oo you see me ma
They wish they could be me ma
As I got better, her body was eaten by Leukaemia
Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad
But the gift within it, was when I first met Chad
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed
Cause grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th
I can't help but wonder, what kind of black cloud I was under
Cause 15 years later the other died that summer... bummer

My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what)
Let it out P (what), let it out P (what)
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes
Until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it
Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out

Ayo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, nigga was action packed
That's Atlantis apartments, we live in half the back
That's where the 12 year olds there, they be flashing crack
And when they shoot you nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back
Aye yo, Didi, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that?
The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat
But I escaped cause I chased, what made me passionate
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps
So many niggas will rise
So many them niggas try
So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied
So many them same niggas, man they moms eyes cry
So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride
Well let me tell niggas something, I'm so glad you alive
Long as you got a breath, a pulse, nigga strive
Divine intervention this is
I heard a voice nigga, listen to this

My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what)
Let it out P (what), let it out P (what)

Jesus will arrange it, but Jesus won't change it
Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it
You mad, nigga don't articulate in Sanskrit
I.E. we best friends, speak best friend language
I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless?
Can't be mad at the world cause you and your girl ain't famous
Cause you both on Bape, BBC and chain-less
Also you're Range-less, therefore switch lane-less
Now you brainless, dangerous, cause you pull out the stainless
All of sudden you smart, now you do something heinous
First time you get caught, now your ass is famous
No longer chain-less, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look
Yo girl with ya man sellin' lane-less, stop
Nigga rewind and reverse slides 3 times
Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine
First picture your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine'
Or fuck it nigga, just keep imagine killin' me fine
Now you, scrunching your face tryna ace attainment
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga
Success is tangible, don't wait for fame
I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say ya name
You unsure of yourself, sit still and think
Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank

My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what)
Let it out P (what), let it out P (what)
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes
Until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it

better days,amos lee,"The darkness has always been
The world was born into a blanket of sin
When all the faith's been gone
Still we've found a reason to carry on

Through the worry, worry, worry
Caught in an endless maze
When the lights go out all that I can think about
Is how we've seen
Better days

Lover, lately I've been thinking I might leave you
As you're surrounded by these fools who do deceive you
Yes, our past is wretched, true
But I'm still in love with you
And that's why I am still refusing to give into

All this worry, worry, worry
Caught in an endless maze
When the lights go out all that I can think about
Is how we've seen
Better days

Where do we go from here
Now we're all so consumed by fear
I'm trying not to be suspicious to those I'm suspicious of
I'm trying to crack open this angry heart
And find a little love

Instead of worry, worry, worry
Caught in an endless maze
When the lights go out
All that I can think about
Is how we've seen better days
When the lights go out all that I can dream about
Is how we'll see
Better days"
better man,robbie williams,"Send someone to love me
I need to rest in arms
Keep me safe from harm
In pouring rain
Give me endless summer
Lord, I fear the cold
Feel I'm getting old

As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord, I'm doing all I can
To be a better man

Go easy on my conscience
'Cause it's not my fault
I know I've been taught
To take the blame
Rest assured my angels
Will catch my tears
Walk me out of here
I'm in pain

As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord I'm doing all I can
To be a better man

Once you've found that lover
You're homeward bound
Love is all around
Love is all around
I know some have fallen on stony ground
But love is all around

Send someone to love me
I need to rest in arms
Keep me safe from harm
In pouring rain
Give me endless summer

I will grow through this pain

What it feels like beside you

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

I found those pictures I took that you were lookin' for
If there's one memory I don't wanna lose
That time at the mall, you and me in the dressing room

Wish I never would've said it's over
And I can't pretend
I won't think about you when I'm older

The things that we don't see
And the skin violin is where the neighbors wont read meals
And the family heirloom jewelery
With sets and heaps of thieves
Will cast down things
That you've never even
Seen like the gods
Like the glory like the stories
That your fathers set before you

And the baskets weave with your mothers [strength] but the ones we'll never keep
Just pretend that things are mobile and will never stay put
And the way we were the day we climbed to the top of the
Steeple with its people spewing angels out their mouths and letting tables turn to charcoal in the lipstick and the lipstick in the evening(oh no)
Oh no we were waving like the trees
Oh no then they moved us to the sky

I find it hard to believe there more
Of these things behind the door

Do i miss you like you miss me

You're gonna drive me crazy

And let our weakness become virtue instead of sin
Our bodies stand naked as the day they were born
And tremble like animals before a coming storm

Take me beyond love
Up to something above
Upon this bed, between these sheets
Take me to a happiness beyond human reach

The force of life is rushing through our veins
In and out like the tide it comes in waves
The drops of semen and the clots of blood
Which may, one day, become like us
With outstretched hands reaching beyond love
And up to something above

Before our juices run cold and our flesh grows old
Let me feed upon your breast and draw closer to your soul
Let me stay with you tonight and I'll offer you my world
I'll take you to the angels if you'll take me to myself

Take me beyond love
Up to something above
Upon this bed, between these sheets
Take me to a happiness beyond human reach

Beyond the grasp of lust
Beyond the need for trust
Beyond the gaze of the sick and the lame
Beyond the stench of human pain"

Above the highs and lows that make up reality
Above the resting place of the body that I leave
My love will still be"

Won't you let me be?
Bottled up but this time
Won't you rescue me?
You should have been here last night and heard what the big dipper said to me
I thought I bored me but I learned to think like you
Now nothing bores me that's that nothing is thought through
Bottoms up and this time

Won't you rescue me?

It's all I can see

big jumps,emiliana torrini,"I walked all morning to lift my heart,
'Cause the world keeps dancing with the paperman.
I love you never talk in dreams,
But now it's here your happiness is real.

Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.

Sometimes I feel so confused,
I'm under the illusion that I have to choose.
I love you always know the way,
The way back home always is the same.

Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.

Tick-tock, this clockwork will stop,
You're the key for winding up my heart.
Brick-brack, if you don't wind me up,
The sky will lie upon me like a passed-out drunk.

Without you I would never rise again.
Without you I would never rise.

Hey there sunshine lift my heart,
I know life is long but it goes so fast.
I love you never feeling old,
You never bought the rubbish that they sold.

Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.

Oh do some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do."
big wheels roll,mark heard,"Twenty years on, and he still thinks he'll make a dent on
the shrinking world... but the pent-up way it works still stinks
The spinning of wheels has been enough to keep him occupied,
keep him tough...
but there's no momentum, just the gravel and the spinning
And those who could help him disappear, saying,
""Wish we could, but we'd interfere""...
after all, they have their own careers

Hey, look up, look down, look out somehow
Look through the blindfold
Shake your fist and bet your soul
You're in the way and the big wheels roll
Big wheels roll, big wheels roll

Oh, no one gets on a leaky ship
""Associations can weaken one's place in history,"" he tells himself
And he tells himself that they're lame and weak,
but he only has himself to blame
for being scatterbrained, quarantined
How can one fool one's self so long?
How can one hold the dream so tight?
He chokes it and provokes a wrong

Hey, look up, look down, look out somehow
Look through the blindfold
Shake your fist and bet your soul
You're in the way and the big wheels go
Hey

He says, ""Damn the cool-headed and the setters of goals who can feel
no evil, no heat, no cold,
who wouldn't know passion if it swallowed them whole
For whom true love is a left-brain risk,
for whom the giving of life is a needless
myth, who cover their graves with monoliths,""
Cool heads prevail, and we'll become extinct
Mutants too unfit to wish - that's the fallout of our fingerprints

Hey, look up, look down, look out somehow
Look through the blindfold
Shake your fist and bet your soul
You're in the way and the big wheels roll
Big

Look up, look down, look out somehow
Look through the blindfold
Shake your fist and bet your soul
You're in the way and the big wheels roll
Hey

Big wheels roll, big wheels roll

Holds his head in disgrace (he can't escape the truth).
He knows the price that he's paid.
He admits that it's too late to admit that he's afraid.
Tomorrow comes. Sorrow becomes his soul mate.
The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.
Old doors are closed but he's always open,
To relive time in his mind.
Oh Billy.
Billy's leaving today (don't know where he's going).
He's got lines on his face (they tell the story of his pain).
He accepts it's his fate.
He admits it took too long to admit that he was wrong.

Oh Billy.
Once he was a lover sleeping with another.
Now he's just known as a cheat.
And he wish he'd had a mirror, looked a little clearer.
Seen into the eyes of the weak.

birds of a feather,phish,"It's easy sometimes when you just coast along
But like it or not something always seems to go wrong
Sometimes people build you up just so they can knock you down
Sometimes they will have you there 'cause they need someone around

Perhaps you'll receive invitations for tea
Perhaps you'll laugh and make them all smile
Or maybe you'll join them 'cause it had to be
Perhaps you'll forget you forgot for awhile

Birds of a feather are flocking outside
Like whippets they dance in a curly-queue dance
Of pulses and ringing and campfire chants
Of ritual drumming although at first glance
You thought you could run but you won't take a chance

It's not an experience if they can't bring someone along
They hang on emotions they bottle inside
They peck at the ground
And strut out of stride"
birds,anouk,"Isolated from the outside
Clouds have taken all the light
I have no control it seems my
Thoughts wander off

Of the time when I tried to
Live life without you

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hopes turn into fear and with my
One wing I can't fly

With sunrise embrace my
Dreams tight and that's why

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

Hoo

To a place without fear, with no moonlight
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
Where memories are being made and where the old one dies
Where love ain't lies

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
That's why birds don't fly"

birth,the residents,"Since the most important person in the Eskimo community is thehunter, and since hunters are always male, female infants are ritually killed if there is no infant male who will someday need a mate to cook, sew, and chew leather for him. This social condition adds to the drama of birth.
The pains were coming in regular intervals and she knew that if she didn'tstart moving now, her legs might collapse under her before she could reach the ice cave. The ceremonial band was already playing birth music and the other women sang in an attempt to comfort her. But as her steps carried her toward the ice cave and the ceremonial band's music became lost in the wind. the true lonliness of her situation loomed even larger in her mind. The gaping mouth of the ice cave eagerly awaited. And although she felt fear, she knew the cave also offered relief from her quickening pains, for this journey had been made many times before.
Her pace remained unchanged as she entered the cave, which now enlargedbefore her and engulfed her in the sweet music of slowly moving ice vibrating within its own cristaline formations. Deeper into the cave she went. The men were playing the kooa and chanting for the birth of a male.
Finally she reached the furthest chamber where stood the Angakok. Deliverybegan immediately as the magic man filled the room with protective prayers. The child was born. The Eskimo woman reached forth with her hand, gently across the already frozen crust on the infant's belly to feel the child's sex; the other women came into the chamber singing the song of life and bore the infant away.
If a good hunter dies, the other men cut him up and rub the pieces on their spearheads to improve their aim.
Bathing is done in urine.
Eskimos eat only meat, including rotten walrus, which is said to taste like cheese."

Knowing you'll always live on in a song

Farewell to old friends
Let's raise a glass to the bitter end
Farewell to old friends
Will you be the same when we see you again

Remember the days
When we'd laugh as you played
Who would have known
The water would come and just take you away
Oh, where'd you go

It's not alright
I can't sleep tonight
Knowing you should have played on
On and on

Farewell to old friends

We all rode the wave

Hand in hand in hand
There's talk of a comet
Over moon and land
The sand has run out of the glass

We stand in a line

Gone gone gone black widow
I let her go
Gone gone gone in a dying meadow

I just opened up my window
No need to argue
If she's going

Gone gone gone as ice melted in summer

I just opened up my window
No need to argue
Lay my head against my pillow
No need to follow
If she's going"

blackout,david bowie,"Oh you, you walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
Your scalding face
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage

Too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands
Get me to a doctor's I've been told
Someone's back in town the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence
And my honour's at stake

The weather's grim, ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming

If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
In the rain
Get me to the doctor

Get me off the streets (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Oh, get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet (wo-ooh!)

While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction, wo-ooh!)
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets (get some protection)
In a? second?"
black,bonnie 'prince' billy,"Black, you are my enemy
And I cannot get close to thee
Our life is ruled by enmity
And I can't weaken that
The only way that I can see
Is to hold you close to me
To love you for it's meant to be
I weaken your attack

Everything was lucked and downy
What was good was up from under
Until black, that awful tender
Came and popped my sense of wonder
All at once all eyes turned at him
Leaving me an unwatched body
And it sagged, my body's rib cage
Out from under ogler's study
Black was decomposing quickly
This was found offensive to me
His disrespect for life's proprieties
Made me scared he would destroy me

Black, you are my enemy
And I cannot get close to thee
Our life is ruled by enmity
And I can't weaken that
The only way that I can see
Is to hold you close to me
To love you for it's meant to be
I weaken your attack

So I thought I'd try to cut him
Try to force him 'neath my level
The only way to equal to him
Would be hit him with a shovel
But to really rise above him
That would be the final evil
So instead I asked the sucker
If he'd care to see my rooms
And as a friend and as a comrade
And all the things that these implied
I made him leave what it was that he had
Used to keep us unallied

Black, you are my enemy
And I cannot get close to thee
Our life is ruled by enmity
And I can't weaken that
The only way that I can see
Is to hold you close to me
To love you for it's meant to be
I weaken your attack

Now black and I we are together
Fairly just inseparable
And in the terriblest of weather
Our bonds are incorruptible

Black, you are my enemy
And I cannot get close to thee
Our life is ruled by enmity
And I can't weaken that
The only way that I can see
Is to hold you close to me
To love you for it's meant to be
I weaken your attack"

I'm about to blast, I'm about to fuck it up
I'm about to drop your mother's angel on the floor
I'm gonna do it fast, how am I to shut you up
I got to free myself and quick I'm out the door
I want you Blast!
I want you Blast!
I left no point of entry and you left your business undone
I'm about to crash, I'm about to pack it up
I'll do it now you know I've done it once before
If I don't last, if I don't measure up
It's just because I'm fucking rotten to the core
I want you Blast!
I want you Blast!
I left no point of entry and you left your business undone, undone

I always keep it with me as you attempt to cause harm, cause harm
Blast! Blast! Blast!
I've had enough, I feel like something's up, I think that everything is happening to fast
And you you're a mess, I really must confess, I got to free myself before it starts to grow

blaze,arsonists,"(Verse 1)
Freestyle:
I suggest you keep your distance
My death blow's inevitable, and youre susceptible to physical injury, this music industry is full of &*^%,
That's why i'm flippin'
Dippin' and divin'
Phoney executives to keep my wins consecutive, we also got alot of actors who claim they bring the drama
The only i'm gettin' laid out
Is with your mama, commas
Couldn't stop me, semi-colons and hyphens when i freestyle
Two hundred words a minute, ^&%* speed typin', i'm hype and
I see the light at the end of the tunnel like one in the chamber, ready to penetrate a stranger
I love the smell of danger, hearin' the word arsonist ain't hard to figure yet
Gotta stop smokin' emcees
Somebody pass me the nicorette

(Verse 2)
Swel:
Put your hands together, we 'bout to bust your melon, crossin' the map with shows, our vinyls top sellin', so stop
Tellin' your tales, your actin' got no character
Need more practice?
Na, you need more stamina
The man with the
Intense spout, burnin' up the vehicle, the battle's just me and you
 sorry, me and your crew
There's no where to run, so when you end up gettin' blazed, put your ashes in an urn and make sure they're being save

(Verse 3)
Jise:
I keep lookin' into the eyes of my enemy's fortress, snorkelin'
Deep within the outskirts; forfeitin', callin', stallin'
Rollin' behind the backburner; stomach turner, don't test me
Creepy crawlers i'm yawning, rapper's really startin' to bore me
Forcin' me to flee upon a carnage spree, see type remedy for the
Tnt
Powers that be
Feed upon our energy, conceit combine our seeds
Here to serve a good deed
For those who need
Intervene you bleed

(Verse 5)
D-stroy:
I drop fakers like drapes after beatdowns, defeat clowns with street sounds
Neighbors tell me to keep the heat down in this cheap town
Where fool's slip like cool chip
This ain't no school trip, it's some cruel #%$!
Like news clips
Crews strip
Demi moore style
Watch me rip through fakes, cripple flakes, make non-believers
Do the triple take, i bomb crews without tom cruise
On the mission
My pole position's got competition's
Mama wishin
They're stuck to fishin' by ricki's lake
Or richard's bay, rhymin' with billy ocean or al b. sure won't get you play
By joan's rivers i clean clothes, lyrical mean pros, go against dream flows
Hope your team knows we get around like news vans
Givin' black and blues man, so who can
Touch the man with flavors like toucan

(Verse 6)
Q-unique:
Fully equipped with a mic and a spray can, i withstand any wicked plan
Conjured by a wicked man, the quicker hand'll snatch up
Rhyme arsonist q spark the match up
The cypher's in flames; got nothin' to lose, but a whole lot to gain so i remain the main
Master of ceremonial like puerto rico remains prisoned by colonial
Your half verses
Over with curses couldn't phase, my basic rhyme patterns'll have you all
Standin' in a maze, i lace the track up as if it was my nike air
Butter
The all knowin' emcees for unaware, couldn't compare glare, i outshine radiant light
Bring light
To the subject of lyrical content
The rhythm gift is godsent"

Windswept child on a shooting star
Restless Spirits depart
Still we're deep in each other's hearts

Some people say it's over
Now that we spread our wings

The hollow ring is only last year's echo

Bless you whoever you are
Holding her now
Be warm and kind hearted
And remember though love is strange
Now and forever our love will remain"

Leaving my cuts, leaving my burns
Hoping I'd learn

Give back as much as I need and still have the will to live

We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags

You said ""See look that's yours!
Stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another
Even in their plastic little covers""

And I said I know it well

That secret that you know
But don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good girl
'Cause it's running you with red

Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both of my hands
Chewing on a candy bar

You said ""Ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this""
As a moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss

And I said I know it well

That secret that we know
That we don't know how to tell
I'm in love with your honor
I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs babe?
Is that Christmas morning creaks?

And I said I know it well

blood from a stone,jonatha brooke,"It's as if we're tracing some familiar fault line
Running down the coast from you to me
A dark potential just beneath the surface
All the worlds colliding in the tragedy

Blood from a stone, wine from water
I'd die here alone, only daughter
Blood from a stone, wine from water
I'd die here alone, like a lamb to slaughter

The silence has become our only currency
For you pay me and I'll be sure to pay you back
But step lightly till you've crossed the jagged border
'Cause the earth may shift beneath you, pull the rug out
All your history keeping track

Blood from a stone, wine from water
I'd die here alone, only daughter
Blood from a stone, wine from water
I'd die here alone, like a lamb to slaughter

I'll reel in my addictions in the face of your distress
Aches and pains all shelved and put aside
I'll jump to my conclusions, but I'll leap to your defense
And I wish I were the brave one as I breathe another lie

'Cause it runs in the family, it's coursing through our veins
It lingers and gets caught in our hearts
Running in the family, it's a little like insane
The trimmings and the trappings of the artist and the art

Blood from a stone, wine from water
I'd die here alone, only daughter
Blood from a stone, wine from water
I'd die here alone, only daughter

blood on my hands,the sundays,"When people say it's sad
You know it can't be bad
And on any other day I'd be soul destroyed
But now I can't afford to listen to a word they say
And of all the times we had
Oh the ultimate late night
Didn't taste right
True words that I should know
Blood on my hands
When you looked around I couldn't be found
A crime's a crime, I'll have to pay
Now I find that I'm thigh deep
Too young for the worst of my mind
You whispered behind me
If I may make so bold
Call it young and wild
But I ran a mile in a minute and there's no going back
True words that I should know
Blood on my hands
When you looked around I couldn't be found
A crime's a crime, I'll have to pay
True words I said to myself
As the wind chilled my bones
Home alone, you call that a late night?
When people say you're dead
You know you caught their eye
And on any other day I'd be soul destroyed
But that's just not the way now
I don't mind telling you
Nothing is quite what it seems
True words that I should know
Must have been blood on my hands
When you look around I couldn't be found
A crime's a crime but I don't mind
True words that I should know well
But surely by now I could say to myself
The days are getting longer so I better get stronger fast
Surely by now?"
blood roses,aktivehate,"The sense of abandon
The end is near
Feel the light of your eyes
Just disappear

Flowing away
On a stream of red trance
Steel penetrates
Your empty shell

Slow deep and hard
Alive or dead this day
Don't care anyway

Drug effect
She don't feel a thing
The blade twists
Nothing for her to cling on

Slow deep and hard
The screams can't stop
The way for equilibrium

Always wanting
Always needing
Still craving
Always fading... Out

Twist the knife
Twist the soul
Order out of chaos
Led out of Gold

Hold your screaming
Bite your tongue
Glitter in your eye
Love in disguise

Blood Roses
Liquid roses on the floor
The more you twist
And she ask for more

Love without despair
Blood roses
Splashes on her hair"

Her purse was filled
All her silver unsold

Little old lady had a mouth

Do rebut that
And if you open up your mouth
You better shut that

blow away,a fine frenzy,"One of us is gonna be here and
One of us is gonna be running
Off alone to the great unknown
You're not me, you're a model of freedom
All you need are your kicks when you need 'em
Come and go, caught that slow alright

With one hand off the side
We get farther away in the blink of an eye

And it's the time we waste
Swallowed into space
It's the time it takes to blow away

Hey, hey you, yeah you gotta be leaving
Say what you want, what you say, say anything
No one knows just how deep it goes
We are old in your teenaged tyranny
And all you need is a hunger to feed
I've got my own secrets though, say what?

With a heart full of mess and lore
We are doomed but we wanted more

It's the ride we take
The many winged escape
It's the bough we break to blow away
And we blow away

One of us is now retreating
You knocked me down so hard
I'm seeing a thousand stars
Come out where you are
'Cause I won't ever be caught crying
And I will not be taken lying down
It blows into smoke

The time we waste
Swallowed into space
It's the time it takes to blow
It's the ride we take
The many winged escape
It's the bough we break to blow
It's the times we say
That no one's gonna take your place
It's a mistake to blow away
We blow away"
blow wind blow,eric clapton,"(By McKinley Morganfield)

When the sun rose this morning, I didn't have my baby by my side.
When the sun rose this morning, I didn't have my baby by my side.
I don't know where she was, I know she's out with some another guy.

Don't the sun look lonesome shading down behind the trees?
Don't the sun look lonesome shading down behind the trees?
But don't your house look lonesome when your baby's packed to leave?

Blow wind, blow wind, blow my baby back to me.
Blow wind, blow wind, blow my baby back to me.
Well you know if I don't soon find her, I will be in misery.

Goodbye baby, that is all I have left to say.
Goodbye baby, that is all I have left to say.
But you have lost your good thing, go ahead and have your own way."

Far beyond the clouds

Help me to see the world
Through baby eyes
And hold them closely.

On the rollercoaster
Made for coasting.

Time to make up,
Time to shake these memories.
It's time to leave the past

And fought through what felt never ending.

My heart is mending.
I scream at sunsets.
Give applause to what I can't control
Then somehow laugh
At how the moon divides an ocean's soul.
I wanna be that ocean.
I wanna shine like that.
I wanna smile so big
My daughter jumps into my lap.
I wanna tell her daddy's fine
And always plans to be.
Then hold her in my arms
This is what we'll always see.

I'll give you everything my life amounts to.
So raise this life up with me

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left

Gone was the glow of
Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm, a memory

Through the years
And I still can see
Blue velvet through my tears"

Leaves me needing you again.

Climbing up torches (?)
Falling down your stairs,
Making my nose bleed,
Staring at your shoes,
Making me feel bad,
Using a feeling,
Jumping off buildings.

You're no exclusive company,
You're always keeping all your borders up,
And it's a little more than you and me.

Well somebodies had a harder time,
But your always on the attack,
Have they been giving you the run-around,
And now you're trying to get your own back?
Well i know you don't like it,
You're no exclusive company,
You're always keeping all your borders up,
And it's a little more than you and me,
I'm not guilty.

Oh well I better say something,
To stop us creeping round these avenues,
You're always keeping all your borders up,
I bet you're getting a little confused,
I don't think so.
Well it's time to turn this thing around,
Well there's no reason for this thing you found,
We're always keeping all our borders up,
I think it's time we tore them all down.

You've got to fight for a reason,
What's your reason?
You never cared,

You've got to fight for a reason,
What's your reason?
You never cared..."
boston,augustana,"In the light of the sun
Is there anyone?
Oh, it has begun
Oh, dear, you look so lost
Your eyes are red when tears are shed
This world, you must have crossed, you said

""You don't know me, and you don't even care""
Oh-yeah, you said
""You don't know me, and you don't wear my chains""
Oh- yeah

Essential yet appealed
Carry all your thoughts
Across an open field
When flowers gaze at you
They're not the only ones
Who cry when they see you
You said

""You don't know me, and you don't even care""
Oh-yeah, you said
""You don't know me, and you don't wear my chains""
Oh-yeah

She said,""I think I'm goin' to Boston
I think I'll start a new life
I think I'll start it over
Where no one knows my name
I'll get out of California
I'm tired of the weather
I think I'll get a lover
I'll fly 'em out to Spain""

Oh yeah, I think I'll go to Boston
I think that I was tired
I think I need a new town
To leave this all behind
I think I need a sunrise
I'm tired of a sunset
Here it's nice in the summer
Some snow would be nice, oh-yeah

You don't know me, and you don't even care
Oh-yeah

Boston
Where no one knows my name
Where no one knows my name
No one knows my name, yeah, yeah

Boston
Where no one knows my name"
both sides now,allison moorer,"Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love
At all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all"

boyfriend,chelsea wolfe,"Boyfriend,
Be careful
'Cause women are poisonous animals
Boyfriend, oh boyfriend,
Be careful if you can

There's glory coming out
I can hear it on our mouths
There is a stranded heart
Swimming on careful air

Boyfriend,
Oh boyfriend
Be careful
Cause women are poisonous animals
Be careful if you can

There's glory coming out
I can taste it on our mouths
There is a stranger's heart
Beating inside my chest

You call this passion
But I call it a cancer"

Smoking cigarettes

Give it all you got
Sitting in clouds of smoke
When you're all alone, why?
Talking to me on the phone
When feeling low

But you don't see them
Keeping space
And open eyes and empty minds
You're not anywhere, oh

Spending time
Smoking cigarettes
Boy, you know your heart's so big
And you could love
Give it all you got
Sitting in clouds of smoke

Fill your lungs, waiting, waiting

brains,greydon square,"Ayo, you gotta use your ""brains""
All I really asked of you is that you try to use your ""brains""
Holy zombied Jesus im comin for the ""brains""
If you really want to battle me then you better use your ""brains""
Yea, they think its a game and fail to use their ""brains""
On some lame outdated books, thats weighing down their ""brains""
Even though the same teaches not to use your ""brains""
That's insane, so here is just something else for your ""brains""

There's a reason they teach it to you when your when your young
Cause' a grown up asking for evidence isn't fun
Trying to explain how you should believe in the same dated creation myths
When you trying to convert someone

Name a faith that lets you think for self
I'll join tomorrow
That doesn't have a heaven or hell
Or promote sorrow
You mean to tell me you need someone else to tell you
That slavery, rape and murder is wrong?

I'll arm myself with ""logic for dummies"" books,
Ten under each arm
Walk in the church and start servin em' all
(Here, read this)
No burnin' of crosses, or sick holocausts
Make em' rewrite the bible with mys in psalms
I tend to write better songs
Goddamn, where does Eddie get off
Not just yours, I mean every god
The lyrical rendition of bill maher's Religulous
I'm serious, religion is bullshit and we're sick of it
Now deal with it

Ayo, you gotta use your ""brains""
All i really asked of you is that you try to use your ""brains""
Holy zombied jesus im comin for the ""brains""
Thats insane, so here is just something else for your ""brains""
They think its a game and fail to use their ""brains""
On some lame outdated books, thats weighing down their ""brains""
Even though the same teaches not to use your ""brains""
Hide mohammed cause you know im comin to pick his ""brains""

Pull up next to someone and look over see who's bumpin'
You already dumb pyramid schemes dont need nothin'
They look at me like, oh shit xenu's coming
Let's take a look at the facts to really see who's frontin
Like your god I drop bombs into active volcanoes
This isn't science at all, I should snatch it from your label
The actors expect to see a return, thats why they follow it
I'm a nerd they lucky I dont side with the Chanologists

Launch full all-out attack on their domain name
And any rapper who'd believe crap to play the fame
Want to try and make his own religion im a get em
Like a muslim or a christian, scientologist or wiccan
Keep spittin superior logic in the lyrics
I will personally rid em of thetan infested spirits
So there it is, welcome to religion
Where its ""thou shall not kill"" unless their different

Ayo, you gotta use your ""brains""
All I really asked of you is that you try to use your ""brains""
Holy zombied jesus I'm comin for the ""brains""
Thats insane, so here is just something else for your ""brains""
Yeah they think its a game and fail to use their ""brains""
On some lame outdated books, thats weighing down their ""brains""
Even though the same teaches not to use your ""brains""
Hide mohammed cause you know im comin to pick his ""brains""

Lyrical debate I'm a throw everything plus the sink
I'm black atheist and there's more of us than you think
What'd you think that I would just sit up and just let you cheat?
Never. As long as there's a beat and a single breath in me
I'll a keep attacking
Every religious faction, every single section
If I didn't mention yours then you get it next when
I step to your reverend with them skeptic questions
A real teacher would've questioned the lesson

Wait a second just take a second to second guess it
What are the main lessons? pain, war, oppression
God can kill, do whatever he wants more or less and
Gorget the moral questions it presents, obey without question
Thats called ""group think"" it happens in hip hop
Rappers change their style to fit with whatever shit's hot
And i didn't start the ""uss them"" it was them
Ask them if its us versus them

Ayo, you gotta use your ""brains""
All I really asked of you is that you try to use your ""brains""
Holy zombied jesus I'm comin for the ""brains""
Thats insane, so here is just something else for your ""brains""
They think its a game and fail to use their ""brains""

The sun is shining again
I'm holding on to things I shouldn? t

When I've been on a losing streak
Hit so hard I couldn't speak
But when I hear Your voice it fades away

And I can hear You say it's a brand new day
The pain goes away and I'm headed for the door
And I'm going home, I'm going home

Your love it burns away my darkness
You guide me when I'm blind
You are the light that shines inside me
Showing me I'm so much more

When I've been on a losing streak
Hit so hard I couldn't speak
But when I hear Your voice it fades away

And I can hear You say it's a brand new day
The pain goes away and I'm headed for the door
And I'm going home, I'm going home

Take me into Your arms
My home lies within Your heart

And I can hear You say it's a brand new day
And I can hear You say it's a brand new day
The pain goes away and I'm headed for the door

breakdown,forever the sickest kids,"When was the last time you talked to me?
Seriously
I feel like I don't even know you
And I would rather me leave
Than stay and watch you make a fool of me

You might as well leave
You might as well let me know now
You might as well go, go, go
I never wanna see your face 'round here anymore
'Cause it's a breakdown, a breakdown
Where do we go from here?
It's a breakdown, a breakdown

Looking at me lying
If I said I wasn't getting quite bored of you yet
And your consistent nagging
And your constant state of panic
Is unnecessary stress for me

You're the tip, tip, tip-top of the charts
You're the best thing I've ever done
And the reality is that I wrote this song for you

You might as well leave
You might as well let me know now
You might as well go, go, go
I never wanna see your face 'round here anymore
'Cause it's a breakdown, a breakdown
Where do we go from here?
It's a breakdown, a breakdown

When wood floors meet high heels
And shadows form from chandeliers
When wood floors meet high heels
And shadows form from chandeliers

breaking up,classified,"[Intro: Sample with Female Singer]
How can I give you, what you're asking for?
Oh baby
When the feeling is gone (when the feeling is gone)

[Verse 1: Classified]
It's been a while since we last conversated, still can't believe we never made it
Lookin back at the way it was, high school love, both of us embraced it
Let me take it back a bit, to the place where the whole story starts
Before we ever had a clue or even knew, how hard relationships are
We was in the same class and I, use to try to make her laugh, then I
Tried to take it farther then a friend, but she just a little hesistant
It took longer then I thought, yeah I'll admit it, but I stayed patient
Was a lot like the music game, never had the skills but I had the motivation
Then in Grade 12, hooked up, became officially involved
I got the lady I've been waitin on, you could say the the mystery is solved
I graduated that year but never left, stayed another one
Told my parents I was upgradin, really I was waitin for you to be done
After that, moved to the big city, got a small place together
Slept, lived, drank, ate together, but it made it hard for us to stay together
Life is oh so unexpected, shouldn't have, the good and bad
Now I'm lookin back at it all, these are problems a man and woman have

[Chorus: Chad Hatcher (Kaleigh Cole) - w/ ad libs]
She says that I should leave, she says I should go
She don't understand, all I've been waitin for is everything {is everything}
For something {for something}, to change {change}

(But I think that I should stay, things could be the same
It's just me and you, with no one to blame
But you don't see {but you don't see}
It's only me {it's only me}, that would change) {changeee}

How can I give you, what you're asking for, ohhhh baby
When that feeling is gone

[Verse 2: Classified]
So after about a year or so, a lot of bickerin and fightin came
Everything we had together, fell apart slow, never seemed worth the pain
More hatin then there was lovin, both arguin about nothin
Neither one of apologize, I guess the two of us were too stubborn
Still lived together though, though decided maybe we should take a break
I never really wanted that, I just wanted change, that was my mistake
I never thought we would break up, never thought I'd find another like her
But I was still thinkin we'd get back together and these loose ends would become tighter
But no way, no luck, threw the towel in, we broke up
I moved out, choked up, depressed every day I woke up
Found out she had another man and this is when it really hit home
Fuck I lost everything I had and I ain't the type who likes to be alone
Now I'm tryin to move along and I felt it difficult to stay strong
But dark days always brighten up, if the fight in ya keeps movin on
A couple months after all of this, I bumped into another girl I knew
Had a couple dates in high school, a type of girl you don't forget, simply beautiful
We talked for a little bit, we took some time out and reminisced
And I forgot about my dark days, she taught me heartbreak can lead to happiness
When I was down and had no faith, she showed me everything is okay
My soul mate, I never would of thought a break up could end so great

[Chorus: w/ ad libs]

[Outro: Sample with Female Singer]
How can I give you, what you're asking for?
Oh, let's go our separate ways, oh baby"

Follow me outside
And I know it won't be long till
I'm holding your hips tight I know you want to

And light the fire up and make it right
Cause There's nobody home tonight
Break out and take it to the floor
So I can take you on and give you all the things All the things we're not supposed to do
Break out and take it to the floor
We'll finally be alone just take me home with you tonight
Just you and I
And sing Oh Oh, and sing Oh Oh all night
Let's go
Cause I'm feeling wild
And I know it won't be long till
I'm touching your skin soft I know you want to
Give it up to tonight oh no
I would never break your heart girl
Just give me one more chance to make it right
There's nobody home tonight

So I can take you on and give you all the things All the things we're not supposed to do

breath control,recoil,"Who wouldn't want a good girl
A soft hand
A gentle woman for a gentleman?

He said, ""It's been fine so far but
After a while, I want more than a soft style.
I want some slashes to go with those long eyelashes.""

And so the bedroom became the black room
But a year later he wanted something more
Something I wasn't quite prepared for

He said, ""Every woman has an itch
And every nice girl secretly wants to switch.""

I like how the skins look on your white hands
I'd like you to deliver one of my demands.""
He said, ""Every woman has an itch
And every nice girl wants to switch.""

He led me in and lit the room with a hundred candles
And said, ""God never gives you more than you can handle.""

I sat astride his chest
""It's just a thrill,"" he said, as he relaxed on the dark, dark bed
""It's just breath control.""
""It's just breath control.""

He whispered, ""Hold me here"" and I did and his head fell back
He whispered ""Press harder"" and I did and his eyes rolled back
It's just breath control, just breath control

I saw him go pale, I saw him seize up
I felt something creep up, like a taste for this
Like a reward, a kind of love, a kind of lustmord

It was a minute, then three, then five, then ten
He wasn't coming up again
I held on for twelve
I saw him seize and thrash and twist and when he was still
I lifted away my wrists and looked at my hands and tried to understand

""It's just a thrill"" I said
As he relaxed on the dark, dark bed
I sat aside his chest
""It's just a thrill,"" he said
""Just a thrill. It's just breath control
It's just breath control
Just breath control
It's just breath control

When it was over, I slipped off the skins
And drowned them in the river where we used to swim
And a year later in a shop, I was stopped by a man

He said, ""I know you're looking for something that's hard to find
And I think I have what you have in mind.""
And he led me to a glass case and looked deep into my face...

""It's just control."""
breathe again,toni braxton,"If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear ""I love you"" now and then

Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand, if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you

That, that I shall never breathe again
Breathe again

That I shall never breathe again

And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the way things used to be
And I can't stop thinkin' about

About the love that you make to me
And I can't get you out of my head
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out my life
And blow my heart away
And I can't stop carin' about

About the apple of my eye
And I can't stop doin' without
Without the center of my life

And I can't get you out of my head
And I know I can't pretend
That I won't die if you decide
You won't see me again
If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again

If I never hear ""I love you"" now and then
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand, if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you

That, that I shall never breathe again
Breathe again
That I shall never breathe again

And I can't stop thinkin' about

About the way my life would be
No, I can't stop thinkin' about

How could your love be leavin' me

And I can't get you out of my mind
God knows how hard I tried
And if you walk right out my life

God knows I'd surely die
And I can't stop doin' without
Without the rythm of my heart
No, I can't stop doin' without

For I would surely fall apart
And I can't get you out of my mind
'Cause I know I can't deny
And I would die if you decide
You won't see me again
If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear ""I love you"" now and then
Will I never make love to you once again?

Sent from above
My hands are tied to worlds alone
And this I know
Your breath's like wine
And just like clouds, my skin crawls
It's so divine
The sky it glows with fields of light
Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me
I love you
And honestly,
I will love you
You make me feel alive
And I'll love you
Until the end of time
My hands shake clasped with fear
As you come near
To say goodnight, just like a dove
A peaceful sign
To help us by as you come in
Let this begin
Stars fall like dust,
Our lips will touch
We speak too much
Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me
I love you
And honestly
I will love you
You make me feel alive
And I'll love you
Until the end of time
Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me
I love you
And honestly
I will love you
You make me feel alive
And I'll love you
Until the end of time
I've got a lot to say, if you will let me
It's always hard, when you're around me
But here right now, there's interest in your eyes
So hear me out, and hear this the first time
That I love you (come and lay with me)
That I love you (and honestly)
And I love you (you make me feel alive)
That I love you

""Take a deep breath relax, don't push it on out.""(x2)
Somebody please explain to them what it be about
They can't sleep yet, too many re-grets
Got em running round in circles for the re-spect
They need the gossip, but where's the logic?
Voices in the box guarantee a better product
So here I sit now, and watch em trip out
Trying to pick a finger to put upon what its about
But if there was a point, you would still avoid
You should've taught the boys and girls how to take apart their toys
I stay up-set,with all the pup-pets
Submerged in the drama 'cause they love it
That if they can hold the pain, and then they complain
Why would you chase away the sun if you don't want the rain?
I never asked for the world, just a portion
Tryin to make a good soldier out of daddy's little orphan
But management called down, demanded that we turned the sound down
And with that, I suggest we start the count-down
Simplistic spiral and work your way backwards
'Til the bastards collapse and choke on their last words
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother
[Chorus]
Breathe in, breathe out, the sign says ""keep out""
Breathe in, breathe out, somebody please explain to them what it be about
Breathe in, breathe out, the sign says ""keep out""
Somebody fill up my gut before I freak out
Low profile, no more smiles, til all of why'all quit acting so damn wild
Slow down child, you're gonna lose balance, too
Overanxious, the goods will get damaged
Girl, how many stories can you fit into a tanktop?
How many wishes get spent on what you ain't got?
The youth want truth, well thank god
Tryin to keep it movin, while you're sittin in the same spot
Been in this cage for a long time (long time)
Been coverin this page with the wrong rhymes (wrong rhymes)
Got a strong mind, I got a weak will
I've got bad nerves and I can't keep still
But I stay humble, so when the meek take the planet
I can get a little piece with my name on it
The only problem is by then I won't want it
I'm in the backyard praying and hoping for the comet
Are you lookin to remember or searchin for adventure?
I guess it all depends on the agenda
Do you carry a grudge? Do you carry a gun?
I guess it all depends on where you come from
Surroundings are gonna dictate the needs
I'm out, I want to live around lakes and trees
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother
[Chorus]
Breathe in..."

Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were,
Stripped to the bone

That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

So glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms

The fingers of trees
The sweet harmonies

Isn't just the way that I long to touch you

The delicate petals
And all of the metals
The old and the hopeless
The young and inspired
The best and the worst times
The breeze is invited
That's just the way that I long to touch you"
brick,ben folds five,"6 a.m., day after Christmas
I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold, car seat is freezing
The world is sleepin', I am numb

Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
They're not home to find us out

And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feelin' more alone
Than I ever have before

She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly

They call her name at 7:30
I pace around the parkin' lot
And I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got

Can't you see
It's not me you're dyin' for?
Now she's feelin' more alone
Than she ever has before

She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly

As weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine
They told me, ""Son, it's time to tell the truth,"" and
She broke down, and I broke down 'cause I was
Tired of lyin'

Drivin' back to her apartment
For the moment, we're alone
Yeah, she's alone and I'm alone
Now I know it

She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly"

bridges and balloons,joanna newsom,"We sailed away on a winter's day
With fate as malleable as clay
But ships are fallible, I say
And the nautical, like all things, fades
And I can recall our caravel
A little wicker beetle shell
With four fine masts and lateen sails
Its bearings on Cair Paravel

Oh, my love
Oh, it was a funny little thing
To be the ones to have seen

The sight of bridges and balloons
Makes calm canaries irritable
And they caw and claw all afternoon
Catenaries and dirigibles
Brace and buoy the living room
A loom of metal, warp, woof, wimble
And a thimble's worth of milky moon
Can touch hearts larger than a thimble

Oh, my love
Oh, it was a funny little thing
To be the ones to have seen

Oh, my love
Oh, it was a funny little thing
It was a funny, funny little thing"

And I went down, down, down

And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now

Would you still say you needed me?
Guess I walked right into it

When I was blind, you came and opened up my eyes,
Now I feel I can believe in anything,
You taught me how to fly on broken wings.

Always do the things I can depend on,
Always there, every night and day,
Everytime I've fallen down - You've always been around,
To lift me up again,
To set me straight again.

And can't find the road that leads me back home,
But you made me believe I can do anything,
Even fly on broken wings.

There's passport controls and oceans of road between us now.

Through countryside to the industry, the routine hits full swing.
I'm taking to the stage tonight with a broken wing.

Things that I lose I find I don't need once I know they're gone,
But that can't be you because what we've been though is valuable.

Clear my lungs, set my breating right,
The violence, the blood sport, the bias, the difference,
The codec for a love at first sight,
Kills the money worry, sets the bias, the difference.

On a cold winter's morning to a church house
Just to shovel some snow.

An altar boy's been hit by a local commuter
Just from walking with his back turned
To the train that was coming so slow.

Throw your hands in the air, say ""what does it matter?""
But it don't do no good to get angry,
So help me I know

For a heart strained in anger grows weak and grows bitter.
You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own
Chain of sorrow.

I been brought down to zero, pulled out and put back there.
I sat on a park bench, kissed the girl with black hair
And my head shouted down to my heart
""You better look out below!""
Hey, it ain't such a long drop don't stammer don't stutter
From the diamonds in the sidewalk to the dirt in the gutter
And you carry those bruises to remind you wherever you go.

You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder,
Throw your hands in the air, say ""what does it matter?""

You opened your wings, such beautiful things
And then I saw you fly away so high
A birds eye view up to the stratosphere

All the universe reflected in your eyes
I came to despise, your seek through the skies
Your web of lies, and all the empty words you say

I see you like a bubble in the air but bubbles can rise
But pop when they reach the top
I see you like a bubble in the air but bubbles can rise

Last I saw you change inside, a chrysalis into a butterfly
You open your wings, such beautiful things
And then I watch you fly away to die

buckets of rain,bob dylan,"Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears.
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
You got all the love, honey baby,
I can stand.

I been meek
And hard like an oak
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke.
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear,
If you want me, honey baby,
I'll be here.

I like your smile
And your fingertips
I like the way that you move your hips.
I like the cool way you look at me,
Everything about you is bringing me
Misery.

Little red wagon
Little red bike
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like.
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I'm takin' you with me, honey baby,
When I go.

Life is sad, life is a bust
All you can do is do what you must
You do what you must do and you do it well,
I'd do it for you, honey baby,
Can't you tell?"
buddy,the lemonheads,"She's coming over
We'll go out walking
Make a call on the way

She's in the phone booth now
I'm looking in
There comes a smile on her face

There's still some of the same stuff we got yesterday
There's still some of the same stuff we got yesterday
(Yeah)

I'm too much with myself
I won't be someone else
I'm too much with myself
I won't be someone else
I'm too much with myself
I won't be someone else

So, we take off, out Fiona's door
Walk until it's light outside
Like before, when we were on the phone

We have to laugh to look at each other
We have to laugh, 'cause we're not alone

As the cars fly up King Street
It's enough to startle us
It's enough to startle us

I love my drug buddy
My drug, my drug buddy
I love my drug buddy
My drug, my drug buddy"
buenos aires,benjamin biolay,"Je suis si loin, si loin de chez moi,
Mais je n'en re, je n'en reviens pas,
J'ai l'impression d'être né hier,
Sous un platane argenté et fier,
Autour de moi, sous leur nuque longue,
Inhalant clopes ni brunes ni blondes,
La meute fauve des cartoneros,
Et les effluves rauques du Paco,

Demente, cansado, pero aun despierto,
Luces verdes, calidas, desatan su violencia cruda,
Vivacidad incontenible de una ciudad apagada, herida,
Deseos eufóricos de alcanzar el alba
Ya!
Nubes de cenizas rojas atormentan la mirada,
En Buenos aires,

Ayer, desesperada y viva,
El cielo celeste al ras del piso aplasta,
Luces rosas se encienden sobre tu cuna rota,
Luminosidad insaciable de una ciudad insolente,
Ahora,
Sedienta, dulce, infantil, infernal y tierna
Siempre,

Je suis si bien, suis si bien ici,
Que je ne veux plus rentrer à Paris,
Échange Flore contre un Kimi Novak,
Bombonera contre le prince des parcs,
Je suis si loin, si loin de chez moi,
Mais jeune con, je ne comprends pas,
Pourquoi mon cœur s'emballe comme ça,
Pourquoi le ciel a des couleurs,
Que je ne soupçonnais pas,

Infernal y tierna,
Siempre,
Sedienta, dulce, infantil,
Luminosidad insaciable,
Buenos aires, ayer, ya,
Nubes de cenizas rojas atormentan, la mirada,
Demente, cansado pero aun despierto,
Ahora, voy al Kim & Novak,
Me canso, vuelvo, vuelvo a ir
Ya!
Pálidas,
Desatan su violencia cruda,
Noche en Buenos aires,
Mi Buenos aires querido,

Je suis rentré, rentré à Paris,
Je n'ai plus rien, plus rien à faire ici,
Y'a pas de Kentucky la nuit,
Y'a pas ma préférée de toutes les filles,
À treize kilomètres et des poussières,
J'ai laissé mon vieux cœur de pierre,
À treize kilomètres et des poussières,
J'ai laissé mon vieux cœur de pierre,

Infernal y tierna,
Siempre,
Sedienta, dulce, infantil,
Luminosidad insaciable,
Buenos aires, ayer, ya,
Nubes de cenizas rojas atormentan, la mirada,
Demente, cansado pero aun despierto,
Ahora, voy al Kim & Novak,

Holding a lightning rod on your roof
This could never shatter me,
Don't smother me with sympathy
What makes you think I'm not over you?

Light up a Marlboro Red
Dance myself brand new

buried alive,avenged sevenfold,"Take the time just to listen
When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all
Chances are that you might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real
Still, I'm on my way
(On and on it goes)
Vacant hope to take
Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile, the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive
I walked the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams, reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
You know, I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real
Memories seem to fade
(On and on it goes)
Wash my view away
Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile, the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And I'm chained like a slave
Trapped in the dark
Slammed all the locks
Death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive
Take you down now
Burn it all out
Throw you all around
Get your fucking hands off me
What's it feel like?
Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart
Now you're knockin' at the wrong gate
For you to pay the toll
A price for you alone
The only deal you'll find
I'll gladly take your soul
While it seems sick
Sober up quick
Psycho lunatic
Crushing you with hands of fate
Shame to find out when it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside, inferno awaits
Evil thoughts can hide
I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin
Release the dark within
This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive
This is now your life (what's it feel like?)
Strike you from the light (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life (what's it feel like?)
Die buried alive (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life

burned out,bedhead,"The light burned out
I couldn't see how to change it
I couldn't move at all

And wait until morning

In the dark
Do things make a difference
In the emptiness
Do things ever change"
burning bridges,family,"J. Whitney / R. Chapman / P. Palmer

Visions they're dancing like puppets on strings
Wait for the face in the choir to sing
Cymbals and symbols you clang in my ear
While rainclouds burst out into tears

Burning your bridges on Cod's Holy Fire
And all of the children you sire

Over and over my blues start to roll
Bypass my body head straight for my soul
While speeches ain't silent and silence ain't gold
When left in the dirt there to mould

Burning your bridges on Cod's Holy Fire
And all of, all of the children you sire
Rainwater preachers hang vines on the road

Lamplight reflections all turned into stone
Of tall handsome strangers who pray down their nose
And they're nailed to the cross, I suppose

Burning your bridges on Cod's Holy Fire
And an the children you sire"
burn,alkaline trio,"There's a lightning storm each and every night
Crashing inside you like motorbikes
We toss and turn, sleep so loud
Grind the teeth in our
Our empty mouths are empty

There's a forest fire burning bright
Spreading quickly towards our last rites
Nowhere to run, pointless to hide
Just lay there and scream pretending to try
Pretending

Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and you burn

This impending doom is left deep inside
And it's haunting you each and every night
Like starving wolves counting sheep
We close our eyes, pretending to sleep
Descending

Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and

Like hell, we are anxiously waiting
Like hell, burning silently strong
Somehow we fell down by the wayside
And somehow this hell is home

As we burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and

Like hell, we are anxiously waiting
Like hell, burning silently strong
Somehow we fell down by the wayside
And somehow this hell is home
Right now, this hell is my home"

but not for me,julie london,"They're writing songs of love
But not for me,
A lucky star's above
With love to lead the way,
I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play
Can guarantee
I was a fool to fall
And get that way;
Hi ho alas and also lackaday
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not
He's not for me"
butterflies,kacey musgraves,"I was just coastin', never really goin' anywhere
Caught up in a web
I was gettin' kind of used to stayin' there

And out of the blue
I fell for you

Now you're liftin' me up, 'stead of holdin' me down
Stealin' my heart, 'stead of stealin' my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

Kiss full of color, makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis

And I came out new
All because of you

Now you're liftin' me up, 'stead of holdin' me down
Stealin' my heart, 'stead of stealin' my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

Yeah, you give me butterflies

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try

Butterflies in her eyes, and the looks to kill
Time is passing, I'm asking could this be real
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal

I can feel too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up

I don't deserve you
Unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious
Then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused
Twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it

My lifestyle's wild
I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down into dark clouds

You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Hey, sugar momma, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me, and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil talkin' about butterflies in my head

I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song, and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me

Wish I knew you before I met her, gee
How good it would be for me

Should've told her that I can't linger
There's a wedding ring on my finger

cable tv,fol chen,"Now you've been working so hard
Running in circles
Like a robot shorting circuits
Like it's set to blow
I've gotta make an appointment
Just to kiss you
Baby, I'm not complaining
But I've got to know

Won't you come away with me
I'm not rich
But the first night is on me
You know I just got paid, baby
I know a place and they got cable TV

Now here we are
By the pool of this motel
Getting dizzy from the spritzers
And the desert heat
I'm getting tired of waiting
Fuck the hot tub
Let's go back to the room
And watch some cable TV

Won't you come away with me
The carpet's filthy but the ice is free
You know I just got paid
So we could order pay-per-view
If nothing's good on TV

It's getting late hit the lights
But leave the TV on
And put in the dance mix
Let the boom box boom
I thought that I knew what love was
Then I saw you
Dancing in your underwear to
""When I Think of You""
When I think of you, baby
(My heart just triples in size)
When I think of you, baby"

Tragar a dor, engolir a labuta

Atordoado eu permaneço atento
Na arquibancada pra qualquer momento
Ver emergir o monstro da lagoa

Dos bêbados do centro da cidade

The kind that I can't say

So I'll watch her drive away
And I'll wave goodbye
And as her tail lights fade into the night sky

Say hey, don't you leave me in L.A. alone
Lover, please turn that car around and come back home
New York is such a beautiful city I'm sure
It's just too far for my California girl

She was so sweet
And she was so kind
So leave it up to me
Not to make up my mind in time
So I guess she'll be the one
To which no one will ever compare
And I guess she couldn't wait on me forever, yeah

So I'll watch her drive away
And I'll wave goodbye

New York is such a beautiful city I'm sure
It's just too far for my California girl

Do you remember when we used to drive
With the windows down?
You remember how I used to hold you when the lights went out?
Do you remember when we looked at the stars
And listened to the waves come down?

Do you remember the good times
Do you remember the good times
Do you remember the good times
'Cause I remember the good times

Say hey, don't you leave me in L.A. alone

A little too far from California for me

call it what you want,taylor swift,"My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gun fight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one

All the jokers dressing up as kings

And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover
Making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right

In love, I missed it's treachery, swimming free
And in one breath a twist of fate made history

Mother Nature took me in
She swept me under then I knew it was my end
My whole life flashed in front of me, so suddenly
And sinking down I knew I could still hear your scream

I hear you calling me
There's nothing I can do
I hear you calling me
To answer back to you

Ooh

And now you're losing sleep
With memories, you spend all night playing hide and seek
Replaying how it should've been and could've been
If only there were omens that you could've seen

Back in that room again
You hope to reach me through a medium
But there's no use
I can't reply to this lover's cry
Oh How I wish I could see you
One more time
To say goodbye

Forever

I Can't let you go

Down from the edge I can see you where we end

And all this magic
Has all this wonder, over and done

What could I give you to speak
Maybe you're out of my reach

Ge latine saliva spills
The flash of a guillotine a smile

No pity for him, their misery screams
Unspeakable things
A cool missile, yes it's in his smile
With open arms to welcome you
Beware the masked pretender
He always lies, this candyman
Those lips conspire in treachery
To strike in cloak and dagger, see!
Candyman - oh candyman
And all the children, he warns ''don't tell,''
Those threats are sold
With their guilt and shame they think they're to blane
For candyman - oh candyman"

Cut yourself off
Hands are tied
My hands are tied

I can't fight
A mountain of ice
I'm going under

I capsize again

It's not fair, this fight
Are we beyond repair?
I gotta say
We were good
For so long
But time breaks the strongest ones

The things that take you down
Seem so beautiful in the distance
Cut yourself off
Hands are tied
My hands are tied

I can't fight
A mountain of ice
I'm going under
And then
I capsize again

I lay awake
Trying to remember who I was before you found me
And I lay awake
Trying to build a city
All the ruins all around me and I lay awake
And you were gone
I'll always love you
I guess love just moves on

Make my way through this world

What direction I should turn in now

Strange, but it seems
There's mutiny brewing inside of me now
I don't want your pity
Just the promise that I'll be alright

And will be until I'm gone

Still think it's strange?

Oh, wait and go again, again

Oh, look, I'm buried
Like a cancer eating away inside of me
I don't want your pity
Only the promise that I'll be okay now

But I am the captain of this ship
Curious hands and fingertips
The same as it was before here
Here, back after all

Why should I be hypnotized
By the promise of a long life?
Why should I hold hope
In tiny, tiny dribbles that glide by?
Why should I lean on everything upon?
I won't be here long

Oh, I know I'm a dreamer
Still seems a truth
I won't be long for here
Oh, it's so, but I think I lay this
On now your lips
I'm drowning

As the music dies

Should have known better than to cheat a friend

But you ain't no lover
You were a friend
But more like a brother

As the miles passed beneath me

Came to an end

But now you're a liar
And you've no room left to defend

When I left, I should have known better
The kind of man that you are
You'd have to get her

And I know you got a lot of pain
That's born inside you
But instead of growing stronger
You let it divide you

How could you be so careless
How could you be so careless

And the waves that are crashing
True lies and passion
Washing on your shore
A line has been crossed
A true love's been lost
That I can't get back anymore

And I'm sure
That we both still love her
It's a shame we both lost her
And in turn lost each other

But a trust has been broken
And words have been spoken
But it can't mend
And no man can deny her
As you laid beside her
I hope it felt good my friend

How could you be so careless
How could you be so careless
How could you be so careless
With her heart"

And walking me back to the firing line

You smile to get in the door
You can't keep it closed anymore
Tell your ma that you're gone to the freak show
I'm crawling all over the carnival
Just scratching a stitch in a skin
I'm moaning for more of the medicine
In the morning you're wondering where you've been
Just turning your back to the ghost

And trying to look like you just might know
That all of the good that you've seen
Just went down and into the drain

Oh, kids am I straight out for now
In the morning I'm gonna find it on out
What in the world can it be
It's as strange as I've ever seen

The girls are dead in their eyes
Just standing around like they're hypnotized
Who'll follow me back to the freak show
I'm crawling all over the carnival

caroline,brandi carlile,"I woke up long after dawn
Twenty years had come and gone
I know when it changed for me
A day in June you came to me
I've seen through someone else's eyes
With nothin' on the other side
Every motel, every town
Pieces scattered all around

Promises that I can't be
Someone's heart that I can't keep
Days so long I couldn't speak
Roads so rocky I can't sleep
I've seen things so beautiful
All around this broken world
That pale in comparison to you

Caroline, I'm on my way back home to you
Imagine what I'm goin' through
Without you by my side
It's been a long, long time
Oh, won't you say a prayer for me
I hope you will remember me
You're always on my mind

I have seen the canyon lands
Crooked lines like in your hands
You'd swear the earth was split in two
I wouldn't lie, I promise you
That I have seen it, you will too
You could not believe if not for
Photographs I took for you, Caroline

They've built towers to the sky
It hurts sometimes to watch them try
They run themselves into the ground
But I know you will love them
And their city lights and city sounds
There's beauty in the struggle
Anytime I feel it get me down
I see you smiling

Caroline, I'm on my way back home to you
Can't imagine what I'm goin' through
Without you by my side
It's been a long, long time
Oh won't you say a prayer for me
I hope you will remember me
You're always on my mind
My Caroline
(Oh my Caroline)

Now I have seen things in the sky
Stars and lights and birds and I
I've been rocky mountain high
And told them all about you
Because you are still the only thing
That constantly amazes me
I love the road and I've been blessed
But I love you best

Caroline, I'm on my way back home to you
Can't imagine what I'm goin' through
Without you by my side
It's been a long, long time

carousel,iron & wine,"Almost home when I missed the bottom stair
You were braiding your gray hair
It had grown so long
Since I'd been gone

And the perfect girls by the pool, they would protest
The cross around their necks
But our sons were overseas
And we all know about the hive and the honeybees

Almost home with an olive branch and a dove
You were beating on a Persian rug
With your Bible and your wedding band
Both hidden on the TV stand

When a cruel wind blew, every city father fell
Off the county carousel
While the dogs were eating snow
All our sons had sunk in a trunk of Noah's clothes
Ooh (oh woah woah woah)

Almost home and got lost on our new street
While your grieving girls all died in their sleep
So the dogs all went unfed
A great dream of bones all piled on the bed

And the cops couldn't care when that crackhead built a boat
And said, ""Please, before I go
May our only honored bond
Be the kinship of the kids in the riot squad"""
carrickfergus,celtic woman,"I wish I was in Carrickfergus
Only for nights in Ballygrand
I would swim over the deepest ocean
The deepest ocean for my love to find

But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
Neither have I wings to fly
If I could find me a handsome boatsman
To ferry me over to my love and die

My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy times spent so long ago

My childhood friends and my own relations
Have all passed on now like melting snow

But I'll spend my days in endless roaming
Soft is the grass, my bed is free
Ah, to be back now in Carrickfergus
On that long road down to the sea

I'll spend my days in endless roaming
Soft is the grass, my bed is free
But I am sick now, and my days are numbered
Come all you young men and lay me down"
carry me home,the living end,"He's gonna get you in the end
Then he'll be your only friend
There's nothing that'll save your soul
All you need is alcohol
Step right up and be a man
On your knees and pray
Freedoms just another open bottle anyway
So one more round is all I need
Fill it up and let me be
It's getting late I should've known
Won't somebody carry me home?
[Chorus]
Pick me up from my knees
Carry me home
We think you should know
It's time to go
No more to show
Yes it's time to go
6am it's closing time the barman turns the lights out
I want another round so bring it on it's my shout
Don't leave me sitting here
Don't take me for a ride
Freedoms just another drink
Don't leave me hangin' dry
Step right up and be a man
On your knees and pray
Freedoms just another open bottle anyway

We think you should know

carry me,eurielle,"While you sleep, dream of me
I'll be keeping our memories
Living in my heart and soul
Waiting for the day
When we will be together again

Carry me to my love
O'er the sea to the clouds above
Where I know he's waiting for me
Carry me to my love
O'er the sea to the clouds above

Take me away to the shining light
Over the waves peaceful at night
There among the stars glowing in the dark
You watch over me
Smiling down patiently

Carry me to my love
O'er the sea to the clouds above
Where I know he's waiting for me
Carry me to my love
O'er the sea to the clouds above

Mmm

Carry me to my love
O'er the sea to the clouds above
Where I know he's waiting for me
Carry me to my love

carry on,fun.,"Well, I woke up to the sound of silence and cries
Were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains and heart like the Fourth of July

You swore and said we are not
We are not shining stars
This I know, I never said we are
Though I've never been through Hell like that
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives

But I'd like to think I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know when I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me

If you're lost and alone or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground, and
Carry on

Whoa, my head is on fire, but my legs are fine
After all, they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door, hold the phones, show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

'Cause we are, we are shining stars
We are invincible, we are who we are
On our darkest day when we're miles away
So we'll come, we will find our way home

If you're lost and alone or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground, and
Carry on

Oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-oh-whoa
Oh, oh, oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
Oh-whoa, oh-oh-oh-whoa
Oh, oh, oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh

No one's ever gonna stop us now
No one's ever, no one's ever gonna stop
No one's ever gonna stop us now
No one's ever, ever, no one's ever gonna stop
No one's ever gonna stop, no one's ever gonna stop us now"
casper,girls in hawaii,"Hunting days are now a shame

catch 22,musetta,"I often thought I'd catch a lift,
To a better place and time,
Where money's not a problem,
Love stories work out fine.

Now I wander through our past
(future's been and gone),
I wander

I can touch the sky,
With you, I'll never die.

Take my Dear John letter,
Better read than dead.
True that I was blinded,
Still too easily led.

Love you and then leave you
Isn't that a crime?
I still wander

I can touch the sky
Now, Look how free I fly."
cavalier,james vincent mcmorrow,"Speak until the dust
Settles in the same specific place
Light refused to go
Drink it from a cast and iron plate
Instead of cold milk
Was offered unripe
Instead of silence
Considered craven

Nothing made it seem
Hidden where the aging soil was pure
Pressed against the crease
Mountains become fragrant at the source
How can you stand this
Exotic angle
I read it somewhere
That they would lie still

I remember how cloth hung
Flexing with the forest clung
Half waist and high raised arms
Kicking at the slightest form
I remember my first love
I remember my first love

Unrelied I was called
Missing teeth out of favour
Nickel beach it was all
Gathering by the sundial

I woke hard
I woke heavy
For the half way stop
Five whole hours in
When I woke hard
I woke heavy with the live or parts

I remember how cloth hung
Flexing with the forest clung
Half waist and high raised arms
Kicking at the slightest form
I remember my first love
I remember my first love

I remember how cloth hung
Flexing with the forest clung
Half waist and high raised arms
Kicking at the slightest form
I remember my first love
I remember my first love
I remember my first love"
cecilia,ace of base,"This is a song about a well-known girl
Who was she?

We will never know the answer to that question

Cecilia - walk in the light
Cecilia - you're gonna live forever
According to a well-known song
Cecilia - walk in the light
Cecilia - did you come home and to whom?

Simon and Garfunkel had a little problem
It was something about their hearts, you used to break
Them, and make them go down on their knees
On and on again

Cecilia - walk in the light
Cecilia - you're gonna live forever
According to a well-known song
Cecilia - walk in the light
Cecilia - did you come home and to whom?

Romeo and Juliet had another story, but they
Were a single pair - not free like you
Still they got a tragical end
So many years ago, life in itself can't hurt

Cecilia - walk in the light
Cecilia - did you come home and to whom?

Passion changes but they will still remember you
I say they loved you and they would do the same for you today

We'll never know the answer to that question

Cecilia - walk in the light
Cecilia - you're gonna live forever
According to a well known song
Cecilia - walk in the light
Cecilia - did you come home and to whom?

I've been trying to overcome the mental blocks I've got
If they loved you, why didn't you respond to all their please?
I wonder

Flowers blossom in my hair
And there are no brakes in this car
And Stan gets is playing
And you are proudly holding a kite that swirls across the sky
Thank god for ceilings
These walls are keeping
All of my dreams
For how long I've been feeling down
It seems like forever
From up here everything is fine
This cloud is big
All seats for free
All in here is here for you and me

All we have is all we need

All the good and bad

Celebrate and everything will change
You're swimming with the hook
That's why everybody looks your way
Celebrate and let those demons race
You were never fake, nobody could take your place.

Can't make time stand still
But you can make it run
You can make it bend at will.
Sparks will light your trail
You were never lost
You were only off the scale.

Now don't let go, never let go again
Now cause if you must go, won't you go down in flames.

Celebrate and everything will change
You're swimming with the hook
That's why everybody looks your way

You were never fake, nobody could take your place.
You were never fake, and nobody can take that away."

Do you feel so insane
That you don't, you don't want to show me your face

And I won't have much to say, if I don't return.

They don't take mess from the sleepy streets
And the abacus says, 'keep on counting...'

The law of the waking people greets with such heavy cymbals
And the morn' catches fire
You're the king who's crowned as they lay down!

A big day is brewing; shall we covet it more?
We owe our advances to the dormant corps
And the silence they display in their four-walled bunker.
My gait now quickens with the greatest of ease,
A shower of truth wrinkles head to feet,
And the answer of the day is"

We were like children posing
Playin' at games, actin' out names
Guessin' the parts we played

Oh, what a hit we made
We came on next to closin'
Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left a masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
The music box played on

Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still, I always will
Best on the bill charade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
The music box played on and on

How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads

I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"
chasing the sun,sara bareilles,"It's a really old city
Stuck between the dead and the living
So I thought to myself, sitting on a graveyard shelf
As the echo of heartbeats, from the ground below my feet
Filled a cemetery in the center of Queens

I started running the maze of
The names and the dates, some older than others
The skyscrapers, little tombstone brothers
With Manhattan behind her, three million stunning reminders
Built a cemetery in the center of Queens

You said, remember that life is
Not meant to be wasted
We can always be chasing the sun
So fill up your lungs and just run
But always be chasing the sun

So how do you do it
With just words and just music, capture the feeling
That my earth is somebody's ceiling
Can I deliver in sound, the weight of the ground
Of a cemetery in the center of Queens

There's a history through her
Sent to us as a gift from the future, to show us the proof
More than that, it's to dare us to move
And to open our eyes and to learn from the sky
From a cemetery in the center of Queens

You said, remember that life is
Not meant to be wasted
We can always be chasing the sun
So fill up your lungs and just run
But always be chasing the sun

All we can do is try
And live like we're still alive

It's a really old city
Stuck between the dead and the living
So I thought to myself, sitting on a graveyard shelf
And the gift of my heartbeat sounds like a symphony
Played by a cemetery in the center of Queens

You said, remember that life is
Not meant to be wasted
We can always be chasing the sun
So fill up your lungs and just run
But always be chasing the sun

All we can do is try
And live like we're still alive

All we can do is try
And live like we're still alive"

Dreaming and drinking Tequila
I came all the way from Marina del Rey
On a plane yesterday
From the gray LA air

From uphill Californio

Two or three times a week
And your green card, da ga verde may never be strong

You just took a fall from paradise
Saw the lipstick on your neck
Maybe you should just confess
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't wanna lose my hair today
But I know there's something in the way
Maybe I made a big mistake last night
When I left you alone with Chelsea

Chelsea's the kind of girl that's cold as ice
Beautiful with nails filed sharp as knives
She called me while you were kissing
So I could hear what I was missing
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't wanna lose my head today
But I know there's something in the way
Maybe I made a big mistake last night
When I left you alone with Chelsea

You're just a typical guy
And you're typically blind
You can see I'm out of here
And that I said goodbye

cherokee,charlie barnet,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine"

Isn't me
I freeze

I was counting cracks in the concrete
I'd memorized them from A to B
A choreography, a part of me

It's not now
The price will double if you try to look
Them in the eye
Don't ask why

clear,cire,"One thing should be coming across as abundantly clear:
There's more than one valid way to live.
But you clutch to your absolutes, preaching with confidence,
Breeding intolerance, and setting limits on me.
You're a piece of a piece of an accidental moment,
A self concerned weak machine, a slave to yourself.
'Got your head in the sand, got your nest built on fear,
Your mind frozen and fixed upon a hopeless idea.

How can I help you appreciate freedom
When you would be happy controlled, blind, and pacified?
Pacified...

There's no love in demands.
No pretense of concern will color your repulsive intentions.

It seems a long time gone
Maybe the whole thing's wrong
What if she thinks so and just didn't say so?
You drank yourself into slow-mo
Made an angel in the snow
Anything to pass the time
And keep that song out of your mind

closer to you,brett dennen,"Well I tasted love so sweet
Played around but not for keeps
I'd never been knocked off my feet until you came along
In the room surrounding me are angels I cannot see
I know they come to carry me to where I belong

Closer to you, closer to you
I'm singing like a sailor strutting up your avenue
Like a clown in a costume shop wearing nothing but my birthday suit
Getting closer to you

All the knocks upon your door
Footsteps falling on your floor
All the shipwrecks on your shore
Mean nothing to me
All the crooks on Capitol Hill
Criminals on the dollar bills
All the money on Wall Street still
Couldn't keep me from getting

Closer to you. Closer to you
Like a priest on a pulpit preaching to an empty room
Like a drunk in a dive bar in the early afternoon
Closer to you.

Poets could not pronounce your name
Gamblers couldn't play the game
Matchstick statues set to flame
Couldn't hold a candle to you
Swindlers on the Sunset strip
Hypnotists and hypocrites
Ventriloquists and Pickpockets
Wish that they could get

Well I've tasted love so sweet
Played around but not for keeps
I never been knocked off my feet till you came along

I sit through the trickery
The jealousy and vanity
The potency of your prophesy
Because I long to be

Closer to you. Closer to you
Like a hound dog in a junkyard honey
I'm howling at the moon
Like a Pirate in a pawnshop with a pocket full of jewels

clothes line saga,bob dylan & the band,"After a while, we took in the clothes
Nobody said very much
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants
Which nobody really wanted to touch

Mama come in and picked up a book
And Papa asked her what it was
Someone else asked, ""What do you care?""
Papa said, ""Well, just because?""

Then they started to take back their clothes
Hang 'em on the line
It was January the 30th
And everybody was feeling fine

The next day, everybody got up
Seein' if the clothes were dry
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed
Mama, of course, she said, ""Hi""

""Have you heard the news?"" he said with a grin
""The Vice President's gone mad""
""Where?"" ""Downtown"" ""When?"" ""Last night""
""Hmm, say, that's too bad""

""Well, there's nothing we can do about it,"" said the neighbor
""It's just something we're gonna have to forget""
""Yes, I guess so,"" said Ma
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet

I reached up, touched my shirt
And the neighbor said, ""Are those clothes yours?""
I said, ""Some of them, not all of them""
He said, ""Ya always help out around here with the chores?""

I said, ""Sometime, not all the time""
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Just as papa yelled outside
""Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes""

Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it, of course
I went back in the house and Mama met me
And then I shut all the doors"

I'm afraid of getting colder, colder
Keep the night burning
To shine our love always, always

Pictures on the wall
Her pictures on my wall
She's so beautiful, so beautiful

Climbing up to fall
I'm climbing up to fall
I'm still staying cool i'm staying cool

One day I'll find you just to prove that I'm real
Out of love and hate, of love and hate
And losing ties with common sense, baby, I know
I will make a bridge to place where my mind goes

Come, oh, come early
I'm afraid of getting colder, colder
Keep the night burning
To shine our love always, always

Thousands of the walls
8 billions on the walls
She's so beauteful, so beauteful

Digi-dogs around
Her digi-dogs around
I'm still staying cool, well I'm staying cool

I'm losing all I have and I ever will
Out of love and hate, out love and hate
I'm losing daydreams and good night sleep
Oh, baby, our passions are hiding deep

Come, oh, come early
I'm afraid of getting colder, colder
Keep the night burning
To shine our love always, always

Always, always."
cold,akala,"Can I take you back for a minute
I live it I'm spillin my spirit
On the beat like streets cold as blizzards
Late night drownin' my sorrow in a bottle of spirits
Was a sweet child, that characters missing No trace
Now it's bora in coat and screw face
Colder, soldier, angry young male
Don't ask how, you already know the tale
Never lived with my father
Nasty break up with my mum and her partner
And of course, times was harder
Moms did her best with the strength she could muster
But she so stressed it was us that would suffer
Plus school teachers hate me, say that I'm feisty
Play all kinda mind games to try break me
Helped turn a innocent kid, into a ignorant pig
Fuck em anyway, I still got straight A's
Winter was real, no gas
I went to bed in full clothing
Back when my world was closing in and mom was sick
I can't explain the pain when the news came
Sorta like the blizzard that came after the rain
My mind was a prison, I visioned the worst
Ran home from school, wanted to get there first
Didn't want either of my sisters, to find what I pictured
Moms was too strong, she just soldiered on
Don't think I don't understand
But I still had to learn how to be a man
Standing on my own two, not the way you supposed to
Funny how the cycle repeats
Nobody showed you, Wouldn't believe I told you what I had to go through
Pressure couldn't fold me, but turnt my heart cold G
What don't kill you make you strong supposedly
That must be why nobody can hold me
Yeah I had a struggle, but really it's sugar-coated
When you think of all the millions barely living and hopeless
In the news Mother and child, bellies bloated
Put yourself in their shoes, knowin' death is approaching
But it's not fate, it's bait, they were thrown in
The deep end of the endless ocean of mans sin
Politics, religion, man philosophize
Got technology and television
Still don't know why the worlds a weight on top of your shoulders
But we fold up, true we can't hold up them boulders
I been through the shit, but came out like roses
I'm blessed, don't ever think I don't notice
I know I got a path, but it's hard to stay focused
Specially on these roads, where foes are like roaches
Foul and I crush em and I won't even notice
If I lose my way, I just want you to know this"
colleen,joanna newsom,"I tell it as I best know how,
And that's the way it was told to me:
Must have once been a thief or a whore,
Then surely was thrown overboard,
Where, they say,
I came their way from the deep blue sea.

It picked me up and tossed me round.
I lost my shoes and tore my gown.
Forgot my name,
And drowned.

Then woke up with the surf a-pounding;
It seemed I had been run aground.

Well they took me in and shod my feet
And taught me prayers for chastity
And said my name would be Colleen, and
I was blessed among all women,
To have forgotten everything.

And as the weeks and months ensued
I tried to make myself of use.
Tilled and planted, but could not produce —
Not root, nor leaf, nor flower, nor bean; Lord!
It seemed I overwatered everything.

And I hate the sight of that empty air,
Like stepping for a missing stair
And falling forth forever blindly:
Cannot grab hold of anything! No,
Not I, most blessed among Colleens.

I dream some nights of a funny sea,
As soft as a newly born baby.

It cries for me so pitifully!
And I dive for my child with a wildness in me,
And am so sweetly there received.

But last night came a different dream;
A gray and sloping-shouldered thing
Said ""What's cinched 'round your waist, Colleen?
Is that my very own baleen?
No! Have you forgotten everything?""

This morning, 'round the cape at dawn,
Some travellers sailed into town
With scraps for sale and the saddest songs
And a book of pictures, leather-bound, that
Showed a whale with a tusk a meter long.

Well I asked the man who showed it me,
""What is the name of that strange beast?""
He said its name translated roughly to
He-Who-Easily-Can-Curve-Himself-Against-The-Sky.

And I am without words.
He said, ""My lady looks perturbed.
(The light is in your eyes, Colleen).""
I said, ""Whatever can you mean?""
He leaned in and said,
""You ain't forgotten everything.""

""You dare to speak a lady's name?""
He says, ""My lady is mistaken.
I would not speak your name in this place;
And if I were to try then the wind — I swear —
Would rise, to tear you clean from me without a
Trace.""

""Have you come, then, to rescue me?""
He laughed and said, ""from what, 'colleen'?""
You dried and dressed most willingly.
You corseted, and caught the dread disease
By which one comes to know such peace.""

Well, it's true that I came to know such things as
The laws that govern property
And the herbs to feed the babes that wean,
And the welting weight for every season;
But still
I don't know any goddamned ""Colleen.""

Then dive down there with the lights to lead
That seem to shine from everything —
Down to the bottom of the deep blue sea;
Down where your heart beats so slow,
And you never in your life have felt so free.
Will you come down there with me?
Down where our bodies start to seem like
Artifacts of some strange dream,
Which afterwards you can't decipher,
And so, soon, have forgotten
Everything."

If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum and I'm your son
I come undone
I come undone
So rock and roll, so corporate suit
So damn ugly, so damn cute
So well trained, so animal
So need your love, so fuck you all
I'm not scared of dying
I just don't want to
If I'd stop lying I'd just disappoint you
I come undone (come undone)
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
(Come undone)
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
(Come undone)
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum and I'm your son
I come undone
So write another ballad
Mix it on a Wednesday
Sell it on a Thursday
Buy a yacht by Saturday
It's a love song
A love song
Do another interview
Sing a bunch of lies
Tell about celebrities that I despise
And sing love songs
We sing love songs
So sincere
So sincere
(Come undone)
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
(Come undone)
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
(Come undone)
A young pretender and my crowds above can see
I come undone
I am scum (come undone)
Love your son (come undone)
You gotta love your son (come undone)
You gotta love your son (come undone)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey hey
Love your son
I am scum (come undone)
I am scum
I am scum (come undone)
I am scum
I am scum (come undone)
I am scum"

comes a time,neil young & crazy horse,"Comes a time when you're driftin'

Ohh, this old world keeps spinning round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time

You and I, we were captured
We took our souls and we flew away
We were right, we were giving
And that's how we kept what we gave away

Ohh, this old world keeps spinning round

comfortably numb,"roger waters, van morrison, the band","Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on, now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease the pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb

Ok
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more --Aaaaaahhhhh!
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, Good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

I've seen a castle in Wales

I figured I was the one

The liar when we don't meet
The loser in this game is
Penetrating you

There are imposters in my heart
And foreign blood in my veins

Prepare to fix up with my ghost
This lover's coming down from you

The wearer of this smile
The bearer of this frown
The seeker of this truth is
Penetrating you

The sleeper of this dawn
The killer of that fawn
The purpose of this hunt is
Definitely suffocating you
The reaper of this shame
The faker of this claim
The lover of your time is
Definitely devastating you

coming home,alter bridge,"As I peel away all the years of pain
I've discovered what's been all along
You were so right, I was so wrong

Every shooting star, they all fall so hard
They all fade like a played out song
Now is the time before all is lost

I'm coming home
I'm coming home

So I'm coming home
Lost on a road I don't belong
I rest my soul, I'm so alone
Far from the streets I call my own
I'm coming home

Rushing back to me as the city sleeps
So afraid of what I will find
Memories they haunt from deep inside

Every broken man comes to understand
That he'll never find paradise
All that he wants was there all the time

I'm coming home
I'm coming home

So I'm coming home
Lost on a road I don't belong
I rest my soul, I'm so alone
Far from the streets I call my own
And so I'm coming home

Back to a world left long ago
And now I know I'm coming home
I find my way back
I'm letting go, I'm coming home

We've come to find what we take for granted
Keeps us alive in the end
Some done their time
Leave you empty handed
Reach out tonight and make amends

So I'm coming home
Back to the place where I belong
I rest my soul, I'm so alone
Far from the streets I call my own
I'm coming, so I'm coming home

Back to a world left long ago
And now I know I'm coming home
I find my way back, I'm coming home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home"

Take one small step outside of yourself and you'll find
You're not the only one
Weight on your shoulders, a tragedy
Is making you older in front of me
Oh, why can't you see that you're here in good company
I can see you really need some perspective here
And you've fallen out of love with yourself
Yah, well, we're just all pillars of self-esteem
Take one small step outside of yourself and you'll find
You're not the only one"

I ain't never seen nothing like that, ah-ah
Like a fantasy in front of me, I-I-I
I think that something special is going down
That's right, I think she foreign
I think she foreign, got passports
Mi amor started slow, got faster
She gon' work some more, work some more
No stopping her now, no stopping her now

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
Oh no no, oh no no

Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive (I could still smell her perfume)
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open

I'm addicted, something like a headache
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it (Chance, the Rapper?)

Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk
She ain't got a heart or a ass, just her brains, gotta ask
'Cause her ass on a learning curve
And she love to earn the verb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctors note
Real deep pockets like a doctors coat
Stay fitted like Diddy, hair back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate wanna rock the boat
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes, it goes her, blank, blank, and rock and roll
She say ""I know, honey bunny that's a funny thing""
Thots twerk for the goodfella
She money dan' with the money team, ra!

Oh no no, oh no no

Oh no no, oh no no

conquer,god forbid,"Why can't you see all the fury inside of me?
Why can't you see? Why can't you see it?
Alone with my thoughts as my mind begins to ponder
I see what we are, and the way were

The lack of interest in my reality
A glimpse into my past,
Look towards the future

The truth right before me
Standing, standing in a circle, in a circle of death all around me
My life exhumes an odor of survival

I want it all
As my world begins to crumble
The body starts to shake

Hoping everything will be O.K
My sanity is fading. Lost within myself
Father... I will call to you, the depths to which we fall

In these changing times,
Loss of distinction is irrelevant
To a lasting existence

Let's go

I want it all
As my world begins to crumble
The body starts to shake
Hoping everything will be O.K

My sanity is fading
Lost within myself
Father... I call to you, the depths to which we
The depths to which we fall, the depths to which we."

Didn't care whose heart was broke

'Til he looked into her eyes

And then in the strange way things happen
Their roles were reversed from that day
The hunted became the huntress
The hunter became the prey

Conquest
Now you know who made the conquest
She with all her female guile
Led him helpless down the aisle
She had finally made a conquest

constellations,jack johnson,"The light was leaving in the west, it was blue
The children's laughter sang
Skipping just like the stones they threw
Their voices echoed across the waves
It's getting late

It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise
Not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listened to Papa's translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations

The west winds often last too long
But when they calm down
Nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Stars up above us chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough and all else fades
Fades away

And it was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise
Not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to all the translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations"

Woken up and found yourself
Within a world of questions,
Where the answers come and go.
And I know you don't want
Sit around and hear
No asinine suggestions
When the truth just can't be told.

But if I may,
I got a thing or two to say.
Although the answers are not clear,
There's not a thing that you should fear,
Because the answers to it all whether things rise or when they fall,
You'll find the truth remains the same and that truth is that God is change.

Hey you! You can talk about talk about talk about it,
But you can't control your destiny.
I think that God is testing me.
Hey you! You can talk about it talk about it talk about it,
But you can't control your destiny.

I'm alone.
And I thought God created you for me.
How could it be that it can't be?
So alone.
And I don't know what to do with myself.
And I don't know what I'm would do.

We'll melt away before we land,
Two teardrops for somebody's hand.

Follow me into just one more Spring.

Copenhagen, you're the end,
Gone and made me a child again.
Warmed my feet beneath cold sheets,

Dyed my hair with your sunny streets.

Children aren't afraid to love
And laugh when life amuses them.

And our love is an antique song
For children's carousels"

In his halls he often wandered
With the secrets of the worlds

And his subjects gathered 'round him
Like the leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colors
For the angry gods to see

And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on

Hate was just a legend
War was never known
The people worked together
And they lifted many stones

And they carried them to the flatlands
But they died along the way
And they built up with their bare hands
What we still can't do today

And I know she's living there
And she loves me to this day
I still can't remember when
Or how I lost my way

He came dancing across the water
Cortez, Cortez
What a killer"
cosmos,cynic,"I long to live with some celestial beings
To adore in silence blissful friends
Gliding into constellations of their smiles
Melting into shining eyes

Chant away
The cosmos grace
Born inside the lotus gold

To be at the feet of celestial artists
Close to the brush of their cosmic strokes
Churning whispers into melodies of psalm
In timeless rhythms, blessed tones

Chant away
The cosmos grace
Born inside the lotus gold

I can live this revelation
With magnified devotion
Magnified devotion
Magnified devotion

""Divine mother
Free my mind from all obstacles of delusion
And lead me safely to thy shores of fulfillment
Awaken within me increasing strength, positive""

""Thinking, courage, faith
And above all fill my heart
With thine unconditional love
With thine unconditional joy""

I want to be closer to higher beings
Near to touch those divine companions
Gathering joyfully from the nether world
As I go through the portal's fold"
count your blessings,rosemary clooney,"Mama always said stand up to the truth
There ain't no such thing as the fountain of youth
Two wrongs never made it right
Grass ain't always greener on the other side
Better save your money for a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may

Only Will Rogers never met a man he didn't like
Always throw the first punch when it comes to a fight
It ain't over till it's over and the fat lady sings
Only quitters and losers throw the towel in the ring
Well I hope you ain't working on a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may

It's a hush my mouth land sakes alive
I don't believe that fishermen smell the same when they die
Never put the cart before the horse
Unless he knows how to push it of course
Seems like I'm always dreaming on a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may

And it was grandpa who said son you can't buy love
You can jump in with both feet, but don't jump the gun
Stay out of trouble count your lucky stars
Never get drunk in two states inside the same day
Seems like I'm always drinking on a rainy day

Count your blessings come as they may

Grandma who said silence is golden
You only answer to one he's the almighty beholder
Bird in the hand is better than two in the nest
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Always save the loving for a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may

It's a hush my mouth land sakes alive
I don't believe that fishermen smell the same when they die
Never put the cart before the horse
Unless he knows how to push it of course
Seems like I'm always dreaming on a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may

Talk being cheap well I took their advice
And the older I get the more I know they were right
Works for me may not work for you
Everything I said was the goddang truth
Well I hope you ain't lonely on a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may

And they're etched in my mind I can never forget em
See it ain't what you said just how you said it
Mama always said stand up to the truth
There ain't no such thing as the fountain of youth
Two wrongs never made it right
Grass ain't always greener on the other side
Better save your money for a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may

Only Will Rogers never met a man he didn't like

Must have been late afternoon
On our way, the sun broke free of the clouds
We count only blue cars, skip the cracks in the street

And ask her why we're who we are"" mm
Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'm on my way to see her
So tell me, am I very far

How our shoes make hard noises in this place
Our clothes are stained, we pass many cross eyed people
And ask many questions like children often do
Tell me all your thoughts on God

We are alive again. We will survive again.
Don't turn your back to every move you ever made.
We are alive again. We will survive again.

And all these sinners count on us to ease their pain.
We're just as lost as them, we feel the sting from it.
Convincing masses that we're all the same.
We are alive again. We will survive again.

Oh, until we all come crashing down.
We are what we are.

We've turned our back to every holy war you've played.
Will you weep when you feel this love you have killed?
We paint our faces âtil we leave a stain.
Then all the chemicals are racing in our veins.

Oh, until we all come crashing down.
We are what we are.

They paint us immaculate.
Ignoring the fact that we're shoving our faults in their faces.
They wanted more.
Of the fame, of the scripted, the same,
Of the sacred, the fraud, fabricated.
They wanted more.

crawl,8mm,"Standing at the window looking out with both hands on the phone pressed to my ear
I lean my forehead against the glass
And it's cold against my skin
I run my fingers along the shape of the phone searching out every seam and crevice
Looking for the way in
The phone rings in my ear again and a machine you comes on
And tells me to leave a message and you'll call
I think now that if I try, if I try, if I concentrate hard enough
I can change myself into something else
Then I'll be able to pour myself into this wire
Travel across these lines and find my way to you
Or maybe there's another trick, another spell
And I could change you
And I'd draw you to me,
Pull you to me,
Crawl to me

Draw you to me
Pull you to me
Call you to me
Crawl to me

And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love"

Getting caught in the spider web

When I'm just feeding my head.
And you know that I'm doing alright
And I won't explain myself to you just to avoid a fight
How I'm living ain't correct,
But for me, its just right

I'm not completely insane
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy.
There's no one to blame,
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me

I've got a pair of ruby slippers that
That I don't wear much anymore
And if I had the nerve,
I'd click my heels and return
To the wonderland I knew before.
I'm waiting on a slow boat to China,
Wanna sail away to the sun.
I've been searching for myself,
And I know I'm gonna find her
If I break away from everyone
So, the way that I act may not fit in
Just because I got a mind of my own,
Doesn't mean its a sin.
I don't ask you to give up;
Don't expect me to give in.

I'm not completely insane
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy
There's no one to blame,
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me
Oh I'll say it again
I'm just a little bit crazy
There's no one to blame,
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me

Some like to live for the moment,
Taking life into their hands every day.
And if they don't get killed,
They get so high off the thrill,
They could float to heaven anyway
And others want to save for tomorrow,
Thinking money is security.
Well, I understand the need,
But I don't get the greed.
They all seem pretty crazy to me.
You can tell by the expression I wear.
Though I seem a little strange to you
I don't really care. I've got the freedom to be
There are others like me everywhere

I'm not completely insane
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy
There's no one to blame,
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me
Oh I'll say it again
I'm just a little bit crazy
There's no one to blame,
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me
Nobody to save me
I'm a little bit crazy
Nobody to save me
Nobody to save me"

Save me from these evil deeds before I get them done

The devil wants to know

cruel,prefab sprout,"Cruel is the Gospel thats sets us all free

With a secret tooth for the cherry on the cake
With a pious smile, a smile that changes what I say
While I waste my time in regretting
That the days went from perfect to just okay

Or be tougher than tough and prouder than proud?

Am I guilty of every male inflicted hurt?

When I can't refer to her shape against her clothes
With the fever of purple prose

crusade,voltaire,"Long ago, I went to war
To fight the scourge of Christendom
I held aloft my blessed sword
And said, ""By God, let them come""

They said their eyes are red as flame
I heard it told, ""From hell they came""
Their breath is fire
Their tongues are forked
Thus are the beasts of Dragon's Gate

I heard my father's words
Deep in my heart
""Son, know your enemy
As I know, my son""

The Fates were kind, they let me in
The dragon's lair
The den of sin
I placed my sword upon its heart and with a prayer
I thrust it in

The dragon fell upon the ground
It was then I heard a whimpering sound
A dragonling to his father clung
Who only fought to protect his young

I heard my father's words
Deep in my heart
""Son, know your enemy
As I know, my son""

Now my son is off to war
To fight the new scourge of Christendom
He holds aloft his brazen sword
And says, ""Dad, let them come""

He swears their eyes are red as flame
And heard it told, ""From hell they came""
Their breath is fire
Their tongues are forked
Thus are the men of other faiths

Son, hear you father clear
Deep in your heart
""Son, know your enemy
As I would have them know
My son"""

So wonderous as you there sleeping

Watch the sunrise and fill our souls up
We'll drink some wine 'til we get drunk, yeah

Am I right side up or upside down?

Won't spill a drop, no, I promise you
Lying under this spell you cast on me
Each moment the more I love you

cry freedom,gaia consort,"From the bottom of the heap
Shouts an angry voice that says ""No, I will not remain asleep""
I have seen it with my eyes
Seen that all religion lives by a steady trade in lies

They try to hold us back with reins of holy smoke
But I am here to say we will not bear the yoke

Once the fact is clearly seen
There is no turning back for fairytales or bloody dreams
If we dare not speak our minds
The Inquisition has a test for each of us in time

Do you trust a creed that claims to set you free
By spending half a lifetime begging on your knees?

Cry freedom! We have nothing but this day...
Cry Freedom We have nothing but our chains – to lose!

In a single cup of earth
Sings the mystery of the all expanding universe
Trust that brain behind your eyes
To carve a space for us within the universal mind

And if it's up to us to bring some balance back
Let it not be said it's courage that we lack

Cry freedom! We have nothing but this day...
Cry Freedom We have nothing but our chains – to lose!"
cry no more,yngwie malmsteen,"There's a time for all our innocence
When the tears aren't far away
And a time to build a strong defense
When the boy's too old to play
And we learn the hard way
Day by day
Giving in but always coming back for more
And we cry no more...cry no more.
There's a time for games and visions
And the stake is more or less
There's a time for fast decisions
When our dreams become success.
We do anything to raise that score
Cause the end will always justify the means
And we cry no more.
Cry no more...and we cry no more
Our year's in misery
Made dreams reality. Ohh
And we cry no more
Cry no more...and we cry no more"

curtains,vintersorg,"The curtains never fall - they only rise
At the cosmic theatre
Standing ovations came at the 15 billion-mark""

Blurs and vague impressions aside -
The engineer, the director
Had the galaxies disposed, and then exposed
For the explorers who never took an answer for an answer

A matter of time - not space
How far linearity has permitted us to see
Outwards means backwards in a universe so vast
Stretched in time, see it commence
- A set of celestial fragments
At immeasurable expanses

How far a flicker can force itself
Through dimness, through fields of emission
The shine slowly turning red
A burgundy sense of distance

An overturned curtain call
- The velvety draperies eternally rising
Into infinite blurs of timelessness
For an audience correctly dressed in
Extravagant suits of flaming curiosity
The witnesses and surveyors of celestial enchantment

Hunted by distance and time
The curtain reluctantly withdraws
A prelude to the swirling drama:
Creation - formation - design
Or deduction - destruction - collapse
- All depending on the angle"

When you found out I'd been on a date
And had a boyfriend (My first boyfriend, you shoulda seen your face)
I still remember I called you crying 'cause of my tattoo
Could have said, ""Beyonce I told you so""
Instead you said you'd get one too
(Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)

Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
Cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why

My unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
And I know I'm lucky (Lucky)
Know it ain't easy (It ain't easy)
Men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming
Lord why did you pick me
Can't stop my tears from falling
I love you so much daddy

Thank you
You've done so much for me
I love you daddy
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else can replace my daddy
Daddy, daddy, daddy"

It happens all the time

She whispers while I'm sleeping:
""I love you when you smile""
I didn't really lose you
I just lost it for a while

damaged,assemblage 23,"I am merely the products
Of the life that I've lived
An amalgam of sorrows
And the wisdom they give
But the weight has grown heavy
And it's dragging me down
It's so hard not to sink now
But I don't want to drown

I'm damaged
But somehow I've managed
This far
But I don't know if I can find my way back home
I'm damaged
But somehow I've managed
For now
But I don't think I can face this on my own

There is beauty in hardship
There are poems in grief
There are trials we must go through
Though they may shake our beliefs
But I don't know how I got here
Lost in the cynical dusk
Set adrift in the worry
That I've no one to trust

I'm damaged
But somehow I've managed
This far
But I don't know if I can find my way back home
I'm damaged
But somehow I've managed
For now
But I don't think I can face this on my own

If to suffer is holy
I'll take my share of the pain
I can swim through this sadness
If there's something to gain
I can reach for the surface
And try to pull myself free
But the last thing I want is
To drag you down here with me

I'm damaged
But somehow I've managed
This far
But I don't know if I can find my way back home
I'm damaged
But somehow I've managed
For now
But I don't think I can face this on my own"

While ladies shake they thangs

Dancing is a ritual we used to maintain
Whether steppin' the crip walkin'

Hard times can soften
In spots we hit often

Good times good wine

Brighten up the night,

dancing,elisa,"Time is gonna take my mind
And carry it far away where I can fly
The depth of life will dim
My temptation to live for you

If I were to be alone silence would rock my tears
'Cause it's all about love and I know better
How life is a waving feather

So I put my arms around you, around you
And I know that I'll be leaving soon
My eyes are on you, they're on you
And you see that I can't stop shaking

No I won't step back
But I'll look down to hide from your eyes
'Cause what I feel is so sweet
And I'm scared that even my own breath
Oh, could burst it, if it were a bubble
And I'd better dream if I have to struggle

So I put my arms around you, around you
And I hope that I will do no wrong
My eyes are on you, they're on you
And I hope that you won't hurt me

I'm dancing in the room
As if I was in the woods with you
No need for anything but music
Music's the reason why I know time still exists
Time still exists
Time still exists
Time still exists

So I just put my arms around you, around you
And I hope that I will do no wrong
My eyes are on you, they're on you
And I hope that you won't hurt me

danger,third eye blind,"I met you at the barricade
It's fever pitch where the crowd has gathered
You said the bow is breaking
You want to get some coffee or something and

Float by the crowd that scatters
I found my people and nothing else matters
Bullhorns and feed back in stormy skies
No one listens but you're so hot when you try

'Cause you've got a taste for danger
It turns you on (Danger)
Just take a look in your face
I know what's going on

You like the taste of danger

Tiptoe through the riots
Vandals laced and braced for action
No sense, no consequence
Green stick fracture
Bounce back at you

You've got a taste for danger
So bring it on (Danger)
Just take a look in your face
I know what's going on
(What's going on)
You got a taste for danger

Beggars stare at the brand new sneakers on the
Anarchists and celebrity speakers
These improbable days my friends
Tomorrow's mundane all good things must end
And the cops told the crowd they must disperse
Your pretty eyes fall as the tear gas burst
Here come the horses and we move along
And I promise I'll see you but the moment is gone
Danger

You're shocked when the spray can splatters
Deliver us from the chumps and suckers
You and me killing time in the present tense
Bound together by someone to fight against

'Cause you've lost your taste for danger
And now it's gone (Danger)
Just take a look in your eyes I know that something's wrong
(What's going on)
You lost your taste for danger

danny boy,celtic woman,"Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an Ave there for me

And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me"
dark ages,nomeansno,"We are living in the, in the dark ages
Haven't seen some daylight in what seems ages
All the information is locked far beyond
Locked in circuits and bathed in silicon
And we're fast asleep with our dreams seething
In and though all is still we are still breathing
But it's him in the dark, he makes me null and void
But it's him in the dark, I think I'm paranoid
A world of half-truths, what goes unspoken
Lines of communication are stripped and broken
And the dark is cold with hands freezing
But this deep-freeze seems strangely pleasing
And the powr-trippers receive facelifts
And the button-pushers all work night shifts
And the misdemeanors seem so ghastly
While the media punch is so lasting
And the Eastern comrades find out much too late
And free men are free to subjugate
Under megashadow, under nine to five
Still it's self-extinction that keeps us alive
We are living in the, in the dark ages
Haven't seen some daylight in what seems ages
All the information is locked far beyond
Locked in circuits and bathed in silicon
I don't know
Go to sleep
We are in the dark ages"

Came the call of a loon
Cold, cold, o'er a plume of smoke
He spoke to my center
He spoke of the future
He sang, ""You, my friend, are alone, alone.""

We live with the cockroach
And we split our cords of oak
And keep this wood stove burning
While the bitter winds are blowing
We stow our words in the cellar
So we never lose hope
And keep this wood fire stoked
While the bitter winds blow

Alone on the land
In the love of the dirt again
There's a sharp, jagged winter
At the center of my home
Of my blood and bones
That sleets and snows and makes me shiver
But you, my heart, I will never know

We live with the cockroach
And we split our cords of oak
And keep this wood stove burning
While the bitter winds are blowing
We stow our words in the cellar
So we never lose hope
And keep this wood fire stoked

So I take a step away
I look up to the falling snow
As it makes its home upon my face

Well, I wouldn't want to ruin
Something I couldn't save
The gap will keep us safe
The gap will keep us safe

Step away
Get me when I'm down

I haul up on my gentlemen
Who have always been there in hard times

They're just not like that man of mine
Who visits me from time to time

Oh, I stretch out my back and travel long
The winter though it darkens me
It is pure and clean and all I want

I'll apologize to the ones I love
For leaving them when the sun comes up
Too bright for me
Darkness descends

Oh well, I'm not well again
And once more darkness it descends
The ground is falling under me
And I can't find the means to leave

Convinced that I am going mad
Oh, I bury my head into his hands
So sure that I am losing faith
Oh, I clear a space in his father's land

The sun fading, pastel in the breeze
The swallow swooping, migrating home
And everything slows

The vacuum draws you in
Strange visions are loose on white
A wall of sound with flutes and strings
Rising on a wave of voices
Surrounded by your humble faith
Morning's there to wake us in time
Rain and sky
The world is breathing, living, but turning in its rage

When summer returns to its warm green fields
Everything slows

Everything slows

Where will it end, where will it end?
Where will it end, where will it end?

This is the room, the start of it all
I remember you said it, I remember it all

And the bodies obtain, the bodies obtained, yeah

Where will it end, where will it end?
Where will it end, where will it end?

Where will it end?
Where will it end?"

All out of words
Too busy trying to save them for the truth
So brutal the nights they are
I couldn't sleep the streets were oh so cold
To die, to be asleep
We'll have the darkness to the roaring sea
So foolish I know you are
To take a walk and never so much stars
And then I start to dream
But I can't read directions in my sleep
The sun comes with the tide
And it's so beautiful I close my eyes"

Now tell 'em, show'em how we do

It's five o'clock am,
And the party is still going strong.
There is a conversation in the corner,
Tell a friend, bring everyone.
(C'mon let's go)
Cus the FM music is groovin'
Folks getting down, getting down in
Thier shocking feet.
Sleepy eyes are peeping,
(They're watching baby)
From the window across the street

And it looks like daylight's gonna get me up again.
(Damn right and im lovin every minute)
Most people like getting up when im just getting in.
(I'll be back in three days like Paris's jail sentence)
And oh, its the only only time,
Its the only time when i can unwind

I swore to myself time and time again,
That I would give up the night life,
(Yeah right)
Start laying in.
But it ain't easy, no, no,
(No, no, no)
Saying no to my friends.
(That's right)
Cus the real, cus the real set don't get started,
Till everyone else is in

And it looks like daylight's gonna get me up again.

Hello world, good morning sunshine
Great to see you again,
Homie, I'm doin fine
Chasin daydreams, you know still pursuing mine,
Sleep is so foreign, TV is so boring,
New York is New York,
Travie is aight,
The freaks come out at night like a vampire.
Nocturnal lurking
The daylight creeps up

And it looks like daylight's gonna get me up again.
(Damn right and im loving every minute of it)
Most people like getting up when im just getting in.
(I'll be back in three days like Paris's jail sentence)

DAYLIGHT"
days like these,the cat empire,"To the gods in the sky
There's one thing you can do
You can send us some sun
And we'll play you this tune
Because sitting in our room
Lying down with a scoob
And the sunshine
Through our window
It's days like these
That make us happy
Like a puppy getting lucky
With Lassie hassle-free
Hours passing by
With the beat one two
Said it's days like these kicking back
Just doing what we do
Number one I'd find some
Loving in the sun
With someone that can make me
Growl and hum say hmmm
A boom boom shake
And the beat that she throw at me
Knocking me flat
Number two
I'd cruise where the grass is smooth
And the sound of the sea
Is a dreamy melody
Snooze all afternoon
Till the night time wake me
'Cause shakedown soon
Number three
I'd be dancing like a monkey up a tree
Find sweet simplicity
By kissing my honey
Get funky like Bond
When he's played by Connery
And get crafty
Like Don Corleone
Four
Watching Oliver jam a little more
Remember the night when I saw
What I never never never seen before
Lavender wrestling a rich wild boar
CHORUS
HARRY'S NIGHT TIME RHYME
And dirty hands
I like them see
They make the music that we play
Sound oh so sweet
And my mother always made me eat broccoli
And now look at me
I'm as strong as can be
So put some spice in my sauce
Honey in my tea
An ace up my sleeve
And a slinky plan be
And most importantly
My mad family
They named me lucky
And for that I'll sing about
Days like these"
days of wine and roses,henry mancini,"The days of wine and roses
Laugh and run away
Like a child at play
Through a meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked ""nevermore"" that wasn't there before
The lonely night discloses
Just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you-oo-oo"

And though you're gone
You're with me every single day, believe me

Days I'll remember all my life
Days when you can't see wrong from right
You took my life
But then I knew that very soon you'd leave me

But it's all right
Now I'm not frightened of this world, believe me
I wish today could be tomorrow
The night is dark, it just brings sorrow, let it wait

de zee,trijntje oosterhuis,"Soms zijn de zee en ik alleen
En is zij net als iedereen
Als ik onder haar golven wil
Dan laat ze mij er niet doorheen
Dat is de zee

En eigenlijk zijn wij allemaal net zo
Dat we ver onder de spiegel willen gaan
Naar waar alle liefde deelt
Maar we zijn te bang om het toe te staan

Wie neemt me mee
Wie durft te beginnen
Wie laat mij zien hoe mooi een mens kan zijn van binnen
Wie leidt de weg
Wie durft te voelen
Ik draag het licht
Jij hebt het zicht
Kom met me mee en open de zee

Kom met me mee"

dead sea,the lumineers,"I stood alone, upon the platform in vain
Puerto Ricans they were playing me salsa in the rain
With open doors and manual locks

New York had lied to me, I needed the truth
Oh, I need somebody, needed someone I could trust
I don't gamble, but if I did I would bet on us

Like the Dead Sea
You told me I was like the Dead Sea
You'll never sink when you are with me
Oh Lord, like the Dead Sea
Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can't you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

You told me you were good at running away
Domestic life, it never suited you like a suitcase
You left with just the clothes on your back
You took the rest when you took the map
Yes, there are times we live for somebody else
Your father died and you decided to live
It for yourself you felt, you just felt it was time
And I'm glad, cause you with cats, that's just not right

Like the Dead Sea
You told me I was like the Dead Sea
You'll never sink when you are with me
Oh Lord, I'm your Dead Sea
Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
The nicest words you ever said to me
Honey can't you see
I was born to be, be your dead sea

I been down, I been defeated
You're the message I was heeding
Would you stay
Would you stay the night?

Dead Sea
Told me I was like the Dead Sea
Never sink when you are with me

dear friends,elbow,"Dear friends
You are angels and drunks
You are may child
Old friends

And you stuck a pin in my pile of sin
And this is a note for a road sign
Cuttin' the breeze in this Tennesee sundown
Came the sounds of the voices I know
I've been pondering trees
On the steeliest come down
But now a moment I'm home

I've got bluster enough
For the sales of a clipper
And the truth never frays a good yarn
But it struck me to say while so far away
You are with me today
You are here are in my head, in my heart

Dear friends
You are angels and drunks
You are may child
Old friends

You stuck a pin in my pile of sin
And you are the stars I navigate home by"
dear god,avenged sevenfold,"A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find
While I recall all the words you spoke to me
Can't help but wish that I was there
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah

Dear God, the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
But I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again, oh no
Once again

There's nothing here for me on this barren road
There's no one here while the city sleeps
And all the shops are closed
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
Pictures and some memories
Will have to help me through, oh yeah

Dear God the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again, oh no
Once again

Well some search, never finding a way
Before long, they waste away
I found you, something told me to stay
I gave in, to selfish ways
And how I miss someone to hold
When hope begins to fade

A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find

Dear God the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need the person who can be true to you
I left her when I found her

What's wrong?
Why can't you just be anything you want?

You didn't understand
They try and pigeonhole you
Buddy, they don't even know you

But hang on my dear, dear, John
Maybe you're not just like everyone
So what, so what

And there's more to live for
Than some abbreviated encore
Much more, much more

You can't define yourself
In terms of someone else
You can't say what you're thinking?
But I don't know what you've been drinking

But don't cry
'Cause life goes on

Why not?

Why you could even be an astronaut

death to my hometown,bruce springsteen,"Oh, no cannonballs did fly, no rifles cut us down
No bombs fell from the sky, no blood soaked the ground
No powder flash blinded the eye, no deathly thunder sound
But just as sure as the hand of God, they brought death to my hometown
They brought death to my hometown
No shells ripped the evening sky, no cities burning down
No armies stormed the shores for which we'd die
No dictators were crowned
I awoke from a quite night, I never heard a sound
Marauders raided in the dark and brought death to my hometown, buys
Death to my hometown

They destroyed our families' factories and they took our homes
They left our bodies on the plains, the vultures picked our bones

So listen up, my sonny boy, be ready for when they come
For they'll be returning sure as the rising sun
Now get yourself a song to sing and sing it 'til you're done
Yeah, sing it hard and sing it well
Send the robber barons straight to hell
The greedy thieves who came around
And ate the flesh of everything they found
Whose crimes have gone unpunished now
Who walk the streets as free men now

Ah, they brought death to our hometown, boys
Death to our hometown, boys
Death to our hometown, boys
Death to our hometown, whoa!"

You're a deep sea diver
Tides are turning in your favor

You came running out of the dark

And the moth and the moon saw
A new religion being born

Baby, let your hair fall back
And laugh like you never
Tasted such a good thing on your tongue
Baby, let your scream come
Baby, let your scream come

Said you been taken over
By a deeper animal

Leaving nothing but the memories of

Eternal stars have changed

To hear your sirening
And who would un ring, oh, your bell?

Close my eyes and leap

It's time to try defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity
And you can't bring me down

I'm through accepting limits
Cos someone says they're so
Some things I cannot change
But til I try I'll never know
Too long I've been afraid of
Losing love I guess I've lost
Well if that's love it comes at
Much too high a cost

And I just had a vision
Almost like a prophecy
I know
It sounds truly crazy
And, true, the vision's hazy
But I can see it
I can feel it
I swear I'll be so high
Yeah yeah

So if you care to find me
Look to the western sky
As someone told me lately
Everyone deserves a chance to fly
And if I'm flying solo
At least I'm flying free
To those who ground me
Take a message back from me

Seeing things that I know can't be
Am I dreaming? When I saw you walking past me
Almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh

You know that I can't get over you

It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce, flow, blow
What's the difference?
One, you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough, po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go

My dough keep the scales tippin' like 4-4's
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever, that's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No déjà vu, just me and my, oh

Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having déjà vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having déjà vu

Boy, I try to catch myself
Boy I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go

You know that I can't get over you

delicious,linda perhacs,"It's the silk and the sound
And the cold creasing down
Of a long blade of grass
Tracing and cooling down
A bare leg

It's the soles of your feet
Finding touches to breathe
On the bare naked ground
Each step a puddle so soft a sound

Like sandals in hand
Climbing a waterfall
Like sandals in hand
Climbing a waterfall

Oh, how delicious
Oh, how I want this now

It's the slip into sleep
With the memories you hold
Burrowed in deep
Turned like pages
Te break and release

It's the first gust of drops
When it's ripening to rain
And the flavor is warm
Scented like leather
Dusty and brown

Like hot desert wind
Teasing along your skin
Like hot desert wind
Teasing along your skin

Oh, how delicious
Oh, how I want this now

It's the narrowing instant
When I look across at you
And I wish I could be
Emotion naked, simple and sure

It's the murmur of growth
Whenever I'm with you
An I don't want to hide
In simple elastic, protecting skin

If only I could
Stand so before you
If only I would
Stand so before you

The wrath of saul, it bit my lip
When I reached for life
The budding tree
It was cold and severed, complacent seas

Black dark caves bleedin into dust
Severin my faith, turned into rust
Somehow I drowned the faith in me
Spearing at my hunger for your feeble needs

I was falling
No longer did the water flow
Who's spirit has taken me
My hunger

Who's god's disciple
I spit at you for mocking me
In this fallen place
Not to reprimand me

I was falling
No longer did the water flow

Can't you see
I spit at you I spit at you for mocking me
[I'm sick now]

I know that that same
Will inside me
Summons me to you
Let the rain lick our wounds

Dogs were barking at the gates
The veils were lifted
The highest will to breathe
Before the night became us

Can you walk with me
I know the sadness it helps
I spit at you for mocking me
... walk with me?
I know the sadness it helps

We were swimming under the earth
And petals formed a crown

desire,boz scaggs,"So much desire in the world today
So much of everything you can't give it away
You could be happy but you're feeling so bad
About what you never have
Because you can't look at nothing without wanting it
And you know that's the truth

There's always some scene you think you got to break into
Or a new sensation to intoxicate you
Ain't it a drag
Staring through the glass at something doesn't touch you really
Or bring you laughter or roses or stroke your hair so tenderly

Desire
Stealing you away from me
Desire
You're living in a dream
Desire
Is getting the best of you

You have to have everything you see
Same one who sold you that last fantasy

That's gonna work for you baby
To fill your arms and your heart with joy

Stealing you away from me
Desire
You're living in a dream baby
Desire
Is getting the best of you

Could you stand a little nearer
Look her in the eye
A lot depends on what you see
Now look away baby
Look my way baby
You'll see

Stealing you away from me

Is getting the best of you

Step into your last goodbye

Twenty dollars will make you die

And I wear black leather

My shots are clean

My shots are deadly

You're as dead as a desert night
You're a notch

As my Colt begins to rust
In the dust

You showed once and for all

destination,the church,"Our instruments have no way of measuring this feeling
Can never cut below the floor, or penetrate the ceiling.
In the space between our houses, some bones have been discovered,
But our procession lurches on, as if we had recovered.

Draconian winter unforetold.
One solar day, suddenly you're old.
Your little envelope just makes me cold,
Makes destination start to unfold.

Our documents are useless, or forged beyond believing.
Page forty-seven is unsigned, I need it by this evening.
In the space between our cities, a storm is slowly forming.
Something eating up our days, I feel it every morning.
Destination, destination.

It's not a religion, it's just a technique.
It's just a way of making you speak.
Distance and speed have left us too weak,
And destination looks kind of bleak.

Our elements are burned out, our beasts have been mistreated.
I tell you it's the only way we'll get this road completed.
In the space between our bodies, the air has grown small fingers.
Just one caress, you're powerless, like all those clapped-out swingers.

Through her auburn hair
And closed her eyes.

Oh can't you tell by the way I run
Evertime you make eyes at me
You cry and moan and say it will work out
But honey child I've got my doubts
You can't see the forest for the trees
Oh don't get me wrong
It's not that I knock it
It's just that I'm not in the market
For a boy who wants to love only me
Yes and I ain't saying you ain't pretty
All I'm sayin's that I'm not ready
For any person, place or thing
To try and pull the reins in on me
So goodbye, I'll be leavin' I see no sense
In this crying and grieving
We'll both live a lot longer, if you live without me
Oh don't get me wrong
It's not that I knock it
It's just that I'm not in the market

Lost his job, when the plant closed down
Was about Christmas time, now there's no work to be found
And like so many leaves we keep on walking by
We don't notice the pain in our brother's eyes

Oh, every mother's son, every single one
Has the right to dignity
Oh, every shattered dream, every soul in need
Has the right to dignity
What you gonna do with your babies
Home of the brave, land of the free
Nobody's asking for what ain't theirs
Just their dignity

Now she's angry, she worked all day
Rent is due, she don't have enough to pay
She once lived out the American dream
Said ""nothin' bad's ever gonna happen to me""
And like so many stones that we throw away
She's got nothin' left for a rainy day

Oh, every mother's son, every single one
Has the right to dignity
Oh, every shattered dream, every soul in need
Has the right to dignity
What you gonna do with your babies
Home of the brave, land of the free
Nobody's asking for what ain't theirs

And I call it a human thing
And it comes from inside
Oh yes it's this human thing
To want to be warm in the night

Oh, every mother's son, every single one

dinosaur,adrian belew,"Long ago and far away in a different age
When I was a dumb young guy
Fossilized photos of my life then
Illustrate what an easy prey I must have been

Standing in the sun, idiot savant
Something like a monument

I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones

Ignorance has alway been something I excel in
Followed by naivety and pride
Doesn't take a scientist to see how
Any clever predator could have a piece of me

Standing in the sun, idiot savant
Something like a monument

I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur

Ooh, when I look back on the past
It's a wonder I'm not yet extinct
All the mistakes and bad judgments I made
Nearly pushed me to the brink

It doesn't pay to be too nice
It's the one thing I have learned
Still, I made my fossil bed
And now I toss and turn

I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones

I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones"
dirge,bob dylan,"I hate myself for lovin' you and the weakness that it showed
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel
I hate myself for lovin' you and I'm glad the curtain fell

I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin
Instrumental

Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'til he's tame
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame
Instrumental

There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet
I've paid the price of solitude, but at last I'm out of debt
Instrumental

Can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees
We stared into each other's eyes 'til one of us would break
No use to apologize, what diff'rence would it make?
Instrumental

So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at
I hate myself for lovin' you, but I should get over that"

Another easy trick, for a steel kiss

Hey love, doesn't make much sense but it's all the same
Did I bore you, yeah my dirty love
Sit back and cry as your world dies

I hate to watch you blocking all the exits
Turning into a ghost
What can I do to get you on the dance floor?
And I hate to watch blocking all the exits
Turning into a ghost
What can I do to get you on the dance floor?

Hey you, a clean hit on a sinking ship
Another easy fix, a final chance to really exist

Hey love, to what more than a last kiss
Do I bore you, my dirty love
So go try your luck, cause your world sucks

I hate to watch you blocking all the exits
Turning into a ghost
What can I do to get you on the dance floor?

Left behind by those we left behind tonight
Quiet now let the poison take
Were we always just your lost cause mistakes?

Wait for me, will you wait for me?
I need you on my side
Wait for me, make way for me with arms wide

Alone, left alone
Watch us slowly disappear with time
Unknown, still unknown
Forgotten, lost, and left behind

Dark lit streets are no place for kids
But they'll give us more of a home than you ever did
We're the silentists left to our own demise
You're still our last chance to get out of this place alive

Wait for me, make way for me
With arms wide

Alone, left alone
Watch us slowly disappear with time
Unknown, still unknown
Forgotten, lost, and left behind

Alone, left alone
Watch us slowly disappear with time

On sunny days, all I can see is a shadow

And I always hide when it's my turn to seek
My only belief is not to have faith in believing
Before I begin, I'm over

When I'm only not lonely when I'm lonely by myself

Numb in pain again
I always backtrack forward
'Cause all in all, I'm disconnected

Quietly loud while noisily silent
Keep holding my breath when I'm trying to breathe
Swimming against all of my waves and the rapids
I only win when I'm losing

Broken off again
When I'm only not lonely when I'm lonely by myself

'Cause I love driving myself away
Dysfunctionally sane, don't give a damn
I can't comprehend what I understand

I'll make it up to you somehow
I'm laughing and you're dancing like my mother
I'll teach you to go off on me
Shake, shake from the horror
Mirror naked feeling high
Radio is not store bought its stolen
Another night is going out
It's saturday and now you've got the fever

disgrace,essie jain,"This way or that way we go
For most of us it's easier
To watch the way they do betray
With wait and see
Looks on their face
Vacant expressions replace
What it was we stood for
We wonder at the motion of the step
The blow
The big disgrace
Now we are stocking the mold
That they have made
To fit like glue
Can't help but think it's all our fault
Can't help but wait for the lightning bolt
Maybe we don't want to know
That every man was bailing out
On issues that they'd have no doubt
With certainty, wipe from their face
They did all they could to replace
What it was we stood for
We wonder at the motion of the step
The blow
The big disgrace
Now we are stocking the mold
That they have made
To fit like glue
Can't help but think it's all our fault
Can't help but wait for the lightning bolt"

Is people making babies

Now it's Disney time

Not in front of the children
Fill their head with dreams
And hope to be like Bambi's mother
And die off-screen
So you can tell your children
That everything's gonna be just fine

At Easter and Christmas
They granted us a view
Of a world so much better
Than the one we knew

Dreamtime, it's a special place
Let's keep each other awake
Our hearts, now they beat the same

There is a thread that runs along
The seam of all the paths we've crossed
A colour wheel that spins around
We fall into one

The price of getting setting suns
We're running to the beat of the drum
We are the creatures, rays and larks
Relax

No-one will find us
On our own island
Just out of choice

The dreamer fought the battleship away
It's over the horizon
Voices inside of us to guide us on
Guiding us on

Can't you hear us calling you
Can't you hear us calling you

Everything was out of control
Alive, untried
From thickets and from thorns
Out came a revelation
Everything was out of control

Do you feel it?
Do you feel it now?
'Cos we want it, but we don't know how
Do we have it as much as anybody ever has?

I wanna wake you from your dream
I wanna know just who you're talking
To when you're singing in your sleep
I wanna find out what it means
Do you love me?

Now we're fine, all right
But all those days are gone
We read our constellations
Everything is under control
Are you tired? (I'm tired) I'm tired
TV sparks and glows
The newsman gives information
Everything is under control

Do you feel it?
Do you feel it now?
'Cos we want it, but we don't know how
Do we have it as much as anybody ever has

I want to wake you from your dream
I wanna know just who you're talking
To when you're singing in your sleep
I wanna find out what it means
Do you love me?

I got marbles in my mouth
A thousand words I wanna say
But it's impossible to spit them out
I can barely make a sound
Do you love me?

Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo

Do you feel it?
Do you feel it now?
'Cos we want it, but we don't know how
Do we have it as much as anybody ever has?

I want to wake you from your dream
I wanna know just who you're talking
To when you're singing in your sleep
I wanna find out what it means
Do you love me?

I got marbles in my mouth
A thousand words I wanna say
But it's impossible to spit 'em out
I can barely make a sound
Do you love me?
Love me?

Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo"
do you love?,final fantasy,"This kitchen has a king!
This hand, this hand is a cunning little bugger
With a habit of turning every A into a B

Unless it's put to work
There's a twitch twitch twitch and a rash, and an itch
For a job, for a magic job, and a magic diet and exercise plan

There are things I cannot do
I cannot not not turn a skinny little shit
Into a winsome Brit who spent his youth in honest pleasure

For all my wily ways
I cannot not not turn back into the boy
It's a tearful day when a boy must learn his limitations

Take a look at this brochure:
Inject, inject, strip away, peel away
The scars of self abuse with a couple of hours in a private clinic

What have I left in life?
The Knife! the Knife! this knife! this knife!
Every inch, every inch of me will come to know its magic!"
do you remember?,one true thing,"Do you still remember all that you said?
I can still recall most every breath.
Never can forget the person who breaks your heart.

And now I can't let it go!
I try to bury it somewhere it can't grow.
No one ever enlightens you until it's too late.

I won't give up so easy,
Can't give up the fight!
Nothing ever turns out,
When it's said in the middle of the night.
No.

A situation so embarassing,
Everybody else knew everything.
Why is it always me who's the last to know?

You hid your secrets so poorly,
I was so blind, I couldn't see.
Why is love always something you push too far?

I won't give up so easy,
Can't give up the fight!
Nothing ever turns out,
When it's said in the middle of the night.

I try to hate you, but I can't.
I try to hurt you, but I can't.
I tried to love you, but I won't do that again.
No, no, no, no.
I try to hate you, but I can't.
I try to hurt you, but I can't!
I try, and I try, I try again!

And I won't give up so easy,
Can't give up the fight!
Nothing ever turns out,
When it's said in the middle of the night.
And I won't give up so easy,
Can't give up the fight!
'Cause nothing ever, nothing EVER"

doctor x,yyrkoon,"Doctor X

Stifle screams coming from
That unknown room
Go through the thick wall
And break the silence

The doctor is here to share
And experiment on stolen
Souls some new theories

Through the tinted lenses
Of the mad doctor
A dark and vicious look
Pierces the heavy atmosphere

Is he a genius acting for darkness
Or for the useful universal discovery!?

Save me!

When science does not progress
According to account of the law
Doctor X starts to
Operate

The sound of the rain rocks
His tricky and crazy experiments
Alone surrounded by lifeless bodies

Making use of his secret substance
And his cutting precision to breach the laws of life"

Welcome to the real world, come and fight

You come and lick my fingers, you're walking by my side
Learning to roll over but don't know how to bite
Are you made of dreams, distorted reality
Tell me why you are dying
Barking without reason you're playing your old tricks
What the fuck you are saying, you are begging for release

Come and lick my fingers, go and fetch the ball
You look funny banging your head against the wall
Are you feeling real or are you feeling fake?
Just quit playing dead
You're living in a movie, you're playing with your toys
Now look in the mirror your ego's been destroyed
Blinded by ambition you're cloning someone else
It's a dog-eat-dog world, no matter what you say, dog eat dog

Dog eat dog, come and fight
Dog eat dog, just fight or die
You all rain dogs wanna be me
But I'm the dog you will never be

dog faced boy,phish,"I can't spare a moment for the dog faced boy
I won't lend another hand to theworm girl of Hanoi
Don't deplete my oxygen for the guy who's turning blue
But ask me, and I'll do anything for you

Whenever I think of you it only makes me feel sad
Whenever I think of you, the best friend I ever had...
Before I gave it up all for nothing
Well, I lied and I cheated

And it made me feel bad
It made me feel guilty for not being true
Oh the months I spend trying for a way to explain
In teh end all I could do as turn my head in shame
Whenever I think of you it only makes me feel sad
Because you deserve better and once I was it
But somehow my good intentions just got up and git"
dogs,pink floyd,"You gotta be crazy
You gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed

And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while
You can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted
By the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder
And harder, and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

And when you lose control

You'll reap the harvest you have sown

And as the fear grows

The bad blood slows and turns to stone

And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around

So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone
Dragged down by the stone (stone, stone, stone, stone, stone)

I gotta admit
That I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground
How can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb, and blind
You just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable
And no-one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do
Would be to isolate the winner
And everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer

Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone

Who was dragged down by the stone"

don't know why,norah jones,"I waited 'til I saw the sun
I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching tear-drops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever

Out across the endless sea
I will die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever

Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come"

You have the right to lose control (you have the right, yeah)

I often tell myself that we could be more than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon, it would all end
I live in misery when you're not around
And I won't be satisfied 'til we're taking those vows

Just make us be brave
And make us play nice
And let us be together tonight

The sky was on fire
When I walked to the mill
To take up the slack in the line
I thought of my friends
And the troubles they've had
To keep me from thinking of mine

Don't let us get sick
Don't let us get old
Don't let us get stupid, all right?
Just make us be brave
And make us play nice
And let us be together tonight

The moon has a face
And it smiles on the lake
And causes the ripples in Time
I'm lucky to be here
With someone I like
Who maketh my spirit to shine

And make us play nice

don't look back,antigone rising,"Heard you talk about leavin'
Heard you talk about leavin' before
Heard you talk about givin' up on me
Heard you talk about changin'
But talk is cheap and I've heard it all before
It used to be that I'd fall apart
But that don't work no more
Cause you can't leave half way
And I can't let you stay

Take your promise
Take your pain
Take your restless heart
If you go
Go all the
Don't look back
Cause in my heart you've been gone so long
I won't miss you that bad
If you go
Go all the way
Don't look back

She asked me why I'm not crying
Cause I did all of my crying before
I took off my pretty party dress
And I don't dance no more
I don't need someone else
To make me feel myself

Take your promise
Take your pain
Take your restless heart
If you go
Go all the way
Don't look back
Cause in my heart you've been gone so long
That I won't miss you that bad

Go all the way

don't look down,david bowie,"Don't look down
They're making sorta crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

I went this morning to the cemetary
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down
'Cause they were making crazy sounds
From Central Park to shanty town
He always heard that crazy sound
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound
And I can't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I've always heard that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
Don't look down
Don't look, don't look down

No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound
I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down
Don't look down, no
Well, don't look, don't look down"
don't lose yourself,laura veirs,"I felt my vocal chords weakening
I felt my concave thoughts
I felt my voluntary blindness
For staring straight into the sun

The romantic air of your eye patch
Called me across the room
I clung there and I danced with you, silent
Admired your divine tattoo

We slept in the shadow of a cedar tree
We made love on the rising tide
We smelled the perfume of the waxing moon
We dreamt of all friendships kind

We touched the blood of the black cat
We pet the mammoth day of tears
In the flickering light we were laughing
Necessity conquers fear

Don't lose yourself
Don't let yourself be lost
Don't lose yourself
Don't let yourself be lost

Dreaming, we were stones in black stillness
Dreaming of the death of the sun
Waking to a world of white windiness
Painted eyes of the holy ones

The death of the word was upon us
And the discipline of the wind
We see less and less all the time, dear
Just look at this mess we are in

Don't lose yourself
Don't let yourself be lost
Don't lose yourself
Don't lose yourself be lost

Staring at the entrance to the mind
I had prayed for your wounds to close
Tiger ointment and a cosmic collision
And the crucifixion of the rose

Don't lose yourself, don't lose yourself
Don't lose yourself, don't lose yourself
Don't lose yourself, don't lose yourself
Don't lose yourself, don't lose yourself

Don't lose yourself
Don't let yourself be lost
Don't lose yourself
Don't lose yourself be lost

Don't lose yourself
Don't let yourself be lost
Don't lose yourself
Don't lose yourself be lost"

You're coming close now, swear I can taste it,
You got me tongue tied, I can't escape it
I'm loving what you got,

All the promises I made that I wouldn't break
It's last call, last song, last dance

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably f- again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian

A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum

N- fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
A win win, come again
A win win, come again
My friend come again

Guys, you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late

Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?

Uh-uh, come again (yeah)

Hey, we've got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you're too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don't think so)
I say it for me, uh, I'm an adult I say, wait
You're too young to be in love, this is silly
You're infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas
I mean, it might be something I don't know

(Is their a difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody?)
Well, you tell me, what's the difference?
Okay, you can love anybody but when you're in love with somebody
You're looking at it like this
You're taking that person for what

He or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do
(You're crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
You might stop being in love
With them but you are not gonna stop loving that person
Maybe sometimes they ain't never been loved before

Or they never been in love before, they don't know what the feeling is to be loved

She killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?"

Damnit man, I'm in the right and I'm civilized
But little boys really ain't used to bein' criticized
First off scooter, take the bass out your voice
I'm respectfull with mine and yo you makin' a choice
Here and, understand it's only once that I warn you
Man make a move, make a threat, I'll make it reign knuckles on you
I ain't a woman or a baby dawg, I'm out of your league
My wife heard us gettin' loud so she's prayin' for peace
She's stuck her head down on some keep your temper shit
Little man gon' say ""Over there's your door, mind your business bitch""
Ha, now that's sweet, just what I needed it, it seemed that
He invited my right fist for a party on his left cheek
I didn't mean to seem rude so I accepted,
But arrived a half a second early, right cross connected -
Oh, staggered him, just by taggin' him,
Mr. tough guy, one punch bring out the fag in him
Little man could make moves that I couldn't,
He cut and tried to foot it, now how should I put it
I stood at full posture and swatted him down the staircase
Bare knuckles to bare face, all punches knew their place
Air point style, the second one take off, the next one land
Learn some respect young man
He glanced down for the brick on the ground,
Fist still clenched up I'm still stickin' his crown
He's in the jaws of the most turbulant blitz in the world
So fuck hittin' ya' girl tonight you're hittin' the ground
I said somebody need to beat your ass,
And then teach your ass, and I'm sorry I can only do half
And while his mellon swell up, a police cruiser pull up
He hopped out all puffed up with the holster of his gun up
Ready to protect and serve,
And it's in his nature to .38 ya' if you're testin' his nerves
He helped the wife-beater stand up,
But not before he helped brother ali into some handcuffs
And you can imagine my surprise,
When his girl came down the stairs with tears in her eyes
And a phone in her hand, holdin' her man
Damn that was not the plan..."

Came within troubles
Thrills held still
Uncertain stead
Not a nice word in a double, double. . . .
We started out happy and true
To one another
Days, strange ways, moved in between
Darkened that dream, of a double, double. . .
We pair and pull up through,
The twine and rubble
Call and through, what could we do?
Binded by two, in a double, double . . .
Born too rough, baby two is true enough
Sworn above,??????, two is but enough
Torn for love, maybe two is but enough
Born too rough, baby two is true enough"

With each trebling hand covering up the face
That seeks high places

Waiting to be unveiled in your darkest time

dragon,breathe owl breathe,"Long ago, before the left and right stereo,
There was a princess, and a dragon.
And, well the princess had no idea the dragon was a dragon.
But, all the while they were pen pals.
Uhm, they you know. the princess didn't know the dragon was a dragon,
because the dragon had really good penmanship.
So, written on a scroll, a little torn around the edges with India ink,
here we go!

You are a princess, and we are pen pals
I am a dragon, but you don't need to know that
I've been working on my penmanship
I've been working on my penmanship
By this lantern lit, so this love won't quit

I am a dragon, and I catapult my love,
Over the castle wall
I've gotta tell you something,
that I've, never told anyone
I am a dragon,
I am a dragon, go on,
Well how can I

How do you stop loving someone?
[How do you stop loving someone?]
How do you stop loving someone?
[How do you stop loving someone?]

So they gather around my cavern,
Spears and torches, and they sing,

How do you stop loving someone?
[How do you stop loving someone?]
How do you stop loving someone?
[How do you stop loving someone?]

So far away, up in the kingdom
I can hear the queen, sing

How do you stop loving someone?
[How do you stop loving someone?]
How do you stop loving someone?
[How do you stop loving someone?]

Let these words speak
let our eyes never meet
Cause even if you love me
What would the people think
What would they do to you?
They'll just keep fighting
and I'll keep writing, to you.

Even though I fly through the smoke,
doesn't mean I made the flare
On my head, fire in my throat,
doesn't mean I made the flare.

I startled you,
You surprised me.
Just knowing you, has made me feel like I can sing."

dream scream,daniel johnston,"I'm having dreams about you
I wanna scream about you
I'm having dreams about you
I wanna scream about you
Everything you've done
You were the girl who seemed to own the world
And everything was all about you
I took a chance to call you my own
I didn't know a thing about you
I thought you could love
What a fool I was
There was going on, I was just singing my songs
There was something mad about you
I took it wrong, you liked my song
Why couldn't I have you?
A crazy dream, you done me wrong
You left me long
I couldn't stand a chance without you
You said that love was dead and in my head
And I just couldn't believe it
And on the phone you said you never knew me at all
And on the phone you said you never knew me at all
I thought there was love
What a fool I was
And everything was in hiper-jinx
Just like an old time movie
You don't understand, can't comprehend
I guess it doesn't really matter
And every dream a nightmare
And nothing really matters
I thought I was loved
What a fool I was

I'm having dreams about you
I'm having dreams about you
I'm having dreams about you"

dreamer,atmosphere,"She got a condition of the heart
A heart condition
So as a kid she had to adapt to smarter living
Not much room to rebel because of health
No drugs, no booze, just kiss and tell
Well known on the scene
Jail bait queen
Had the first baby barely eighteen
Father of the child was after one thing
When the daughter came the dad was unseen
It don't matter he ain't got a job
So she had to go to work and leave the baby with her mom
Second shift till the neck is stiff
But she worked it and built her own nest to live
Soon after that baby's daddy slash lazy bunk
With no cash he want to come over and crash
He want to play his part
So she let him move in to that garden level apartment
She knew better she did it anyways
Explain better when your trying to see some better days
The suns up catch those rays
Butterfly style who's got chase
[Chorus: x2]
But she still dreams after she woke
Tight hold on that hope
Sometimes it can seem so cold
Do what you got to do to cope
Two years later two months pregnant
Same daddy same broke ass situation
This time the doc said that her heart might break
Praise god that the job got her health benefits straight
She believes in the right to choice
But she loves baby girl and she wants a boy
Makes more now a days on the day-shift
Balance that with night class
Take some time and space and make it all fit
The apartment they now live in is overcrowded
Raised her voice and made her point
Told that boy go get employed
He put on his best shirt
Said he wasnt coming back till he gets work
She knew what that part meant
So she swept every piece out that apartment
Peace out keep out
Take the scenic route
Rather only have to feed three mouths
She adapts to everything know
And nobody asks what she dreams out
[Chorus: x2]
Little girl was the first reason to breathe
And the little man was the first man she believed in
She gotta live right and do right by self
She do for self she don't want your help
Afraid of being alone
But fear ain't enough to knock her off of that stone
Gonna make that home her home
With or without a man that she can call her own
Big boss at work is anxious
Continues to hand her the wrong advances
She passes the test
She knew the answers
Quit the job to go take a chance
With life
This is life we all scream
While we pray for dollars and we work for change
Its all the same, we all struggle
Sometimes you gotta say fuck you
When you smile and she doesn't return it
Give her room and don't disturb it
If it makes it hurt less to curse and fight
Go ahead and hate the world girl you've earned the right
[Chorus: x3]"
dreaming,allo darlin',"Will you go out with me tonight
Lose it on a disco floor
Take the night bus with me tonight
Frost on the window
It's freezing out here on the pavement
But here in your arms
It's heaven
I can wait for you now
But not forever

I have tried everything I know
To make you understand
This is not a game for broken hearts
Played by a lonely band
We've both got so much to lose
But here in your arms
It's heaven
I can wait for you now
But not forever

I was surprised by how happy I was
Don't ask why it's just because
Down by the harbour in the dawn
It's not a star it's a satellite
The thought of it keeps me from sleeping
Or am I already dreaming?"

I see the night transforming into dawn

No matter where the winds of life may lead you
I'll always be there by your side"

And all the mammals fled
I smell in the charred darkness

When you sing your song
Your voice washed over the sea
Glacial land of
Beautiful blue light came o'er me
Came o'er me

Drink deep, my love
For the water is gasping for your mouth
Gasping for your mouth
Drink deep, my love
For the water is gasping for your mouth

I remember in the burning
A secret magic expense
A flame universe of bright gold and white
I treasured the whole fest
But it was too hard to touch
I flew out with the cinders in a mighty black rush

Drink deep, my love
For the water is gasping for your mouth
Gasping for your mouth
Drink deep, my love
For the water is gasping for your mouth

And the fire closed his eyes
Tipped his flame hat and slipped through the dire rye
We wandered romantic
We scattered dark branches
With the singing green stars as our guide
With the singing green stars as our guide

Drink deep, my love
For the water is gasping for your mouth
Gasping for your mouth
Drink deep, my love
For the water is gasping for your mouth (x2)"

To spit it back up

Just not going to do
I need some air

Reminds me of a clock
That just won't tick
I want to wake up

From this concussion
But my dream is just not done
I'm late again
It's just one of those

Bad days look outside and
Be careful what you ride
You just might find
That you're out of time

To swim ashore
If I drift long enough
I'll be home

He's got delusions between his ears
Man, it takes up too much space
And all that tension between his gears
Man, he'll never ever leave this place

He's got stones instead of bones
And everybody knows
All that that can make you real real slow
And if Heaven was below
He'd know just where to go
Dive in the ocean and he'd sink like a stone
And he'd say

It's time to swim ashore
If I drift long enough
I'll be home

Hold on if you can
You're gonna sink faster
Than you can imagine, so hold
Hold on if you can
You're gonna sink faster
Than you can imagine, so hold

If I drift long enough
I'll be home"

To your dreams?
And who's gonna plug their ears
When you scream?

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, oh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?

Who's gonna hold you down
When you shake?
And who's gonna come around
When you break?

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, oh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?

Oh, you know you can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, oh no

driving,everything but the girl,"Oh lover boy, to you I belong
Maybe one day you'll wake, and you'll find me gone
Oh lover boy, if you call me home
I'll come driving, I'll come driving fast as wheels can turn
Oh lover boy, I know you too well
All of my lonely secrets to you I tell
The highest of highs, the lowest of lows
I'll come driving, I'll come driving fast as wheels can turn
Driving, I'll come driving, fast as wheels can turn
Stretching away as far as I can see
Deserts and darkness, my hand on the wheel
Lover boy, please call me home
A girl can get lonely out here on her own
He said, somedays I find the old ways frighten me too easily
I leave my key and say I'm too young
Lover boy if you call me home
I'll come driving, I'll come driving fast as wheels can turn
Driving, I'll come driving, fast as wheels can turn
Driving, I'll come driving"

Is like a stone
Making out you're flying
But you've just been thrown

'Til kingdom comes
And through bitten tongues
These eyes get stung
With every curse sung

These twisted times
Can't compare to mine
And heaven knows
Where loving goes

I should have guessed
When I took that girl
Do I love her still
Well that's just a chill"
drowned,tim minchin,"Your love is like finger nails on a chalkboard
Your love is like throwing myself overboard
A breakdown on a motorway
A heart attack on Christmas day
Like scaling a cliff then falling off
Like trying not to cough
And I didn’t see this one coming, now I’m in too deep
I didn’t see this one coming, now I’m in too deep
I think I’ll just keep swimming down, down, down
There’s no point in trying to turn back now
I’m drowned
I’m drowned
Your love is like sand inside a bathing suit
Your love is a symphony with the sound on mute
A letter sent to the wrong address
Or red wine on a wedding dress
Like broken bones in my playing hand
Like trying to swallow sand
'Cause I didn’t see this one coming, now I’m in too deep
I didn’t see this one coming, now I’m in too deep
I think I’ll just keep swimming down, down, down
There’s no point in trying to reach dry ground
I’m drowned
I’m drowned
Your love is like one last breath of salty air
Your love is like a map that leads to nowhere
A wine glass on a concrete floor
The overuse of metaphor
The straight ahead in a sideways glance
Like the misstep in a dance
'Cause I didn’t see this one coming, now I’m in too deep
I didn’t see this one coming, now I’m in too deep
I think I’ll just keep swimming down
There’s no point in turning round
I’m drowned

Makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper

One more moment of this silence
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me

Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?

Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself
Don't let me drown
Who will make me fight?
Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself

Leaves you broken instead

drunk on love,basia,"I was dreaming when I jumped the lights
Busy scaling dizzy heights
Hummed a somewhat strangely familiar tune

My eyes as wide as open books
And from my ears upon two hooks
A big smile was hanging there like a crescent moon

It sometimes comes as quite a shock
When the Gods of love
When the Gods of love decide to knock

You're in a state of disarray
Just when you least expect it
You'll never know a better day

Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour
Stone cold sober

The officer who stopped me said
""Lucky you didn't wind up dead""
And he guessed that I was over and above

I hoped he'd only caution me
I made a plea for clemency
On the grounds that I was only there drunk on love

It sometimes comes as quite a shock
When the Gods of love
When the Gods of love decide to knock

You're in a state of disarray
Just when you least expect it
You'll never know a better day

Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour
Stone cold sober

Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour
Stone cold sober

It sometimes comes as quite a shock
When the Gods of love decide to knock
And leave you in a state of total disarray
Just when you least expect it, you'll never know a better day

You'll never know, you'll never know
You'll never know a better day, yeah
You'll never know a better day
You'll never know a better day

Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour
Stone cold sober

Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour

I am so damn sick of trying
And now we are fucked cause we've wrecked it all

Yeah we're here again
So phony and today is the day it ends

I can't complain
It's been good not great but the time flew by
It came from behind it was flying
It was hard to hold on every time we'd fight
And though it would end it's exhausting
In the cracks that would grow in and out of mind
And into your heart like a virus
It would crawl and would crawl as we laid there blind
And broke you and I

So dry your eyes
Get on your feet don't pretend to cry
Or fix you and I
Yeah we're here again
So phony and today is the day it ends

dublin,thin lizzy,"After our affair
I swore that I'd leave Dublin
And in that line I'd left behind
The years, the tears, the memories and you

In Dublin

At the quays friends come and say farewell
We'd laugh and joke and smoke
And later on the boat
I'd cry over you

In Dublin

How can I leave the town that brings me down
That has no jobs
Is blessed by God
And makes me cry

Dublin

And at sea with flowing hair
I'd think of Dublin
Of Grafton Street and Derby Square
And those for whom I really care and you

In Dublin"

We'll pile them up and burn them to the ground
Dumb it down
And if you say that we're corrupt
We'll round you up and run you out of town
Dumb it down

Down and down and down it goes
Where it stops nobody knows
And not a lot of people seem to care
Well it's so crazy, it's so great
We can all communicate
But no one's saying anything out there
Is there anybody out there?

Intelligence is dangerous
A virus of the brain you pass around
Dumb it down
We'll vaccinate each boy and girl
Lobotomise the world through sight and sound
Dumb it down
No one can tell you what to think
And if you think that's true then you're a clown
Dumb it down
'Cause freedom's wasted on the free
You just don't see the beauty all around
Dumb it down

Down and down and down we slide
It's too tricky to decide
Between channels one and sixty-three
'Cause everything is mindless fluff
Like this world's not dumb enough
Does anybody feel the same as me?
Is there anybody listening?"

Rockin' through the sand and burnin' up

Little dune buggy

In my hand

Okay, I got a
Rubber band motor hummin' on the beach
And ready for fun
Quit spinnin' that web and
Come out and play in the sun
8 thimble sized cylinders
To be as smooth as you please
Spider's badass fat old abdomen's
Stuck in the bucket seat

Squishy transmission was caught in drive
Spiderman was squintin' at the sand and the sky

To the floor with his fuzzy little toe

dying,five for fighting,"I'm dying
Dying to wake up without you
Without you in my head again

I'm dying
Dying to forget about you
That you ever lived

There's a shade come over this
Heart that's coping with
Laying down to rest

I'm dying to live without you again

I'm dying
Dying to find a distraction
Get you away from me

I'm dying
Dying to reach a conclusion
So that the world can see

It's the same old story of
Love and glory that
Broke before it bent

I'm dying to live without you again

The first time you left
I said goodbye
Now there's not a prayer
That can survive

Dying
Dying to die just to come back
So we can meet again

Dying
Dying to say what I always
Always should have said
It's a strange emotion this
But there's still hope in this
As long as there's a breath
I'm Dying and I can't live without you again
It's a strange emotion this
But there's still hope in this
As long as there's a breath
I'm dying and I can't live without you
I'm dying and I can't live without you again"

And I'm poking in something, oh damn but it ain't no joke
Cut guards and red beans
And for them niggas that follow me around for my mojo
Feeling so see, 'cause I'm floating in ecstasy (Alright)
My nigga just call up the homey to hook us up on that liquid G
And if these hoes don't want to see, they gotta check the spot quickly
I'm feeling way high, but I'm also feeling way low
But damn I'm stuck in between
Fucking with broad boys and never get used
Just help, just throw in a few more
Diablos, nigga Flesh Bone so chill
I'm feeling it hump through my body, feeling hot and exotic
Feeling knocked out, feeling too sexy for my motherfuckin' self!
Gotta find my bitch and fuck her ass to death!
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy
Who's my nigga that told me the level?
I started to see the devil, nigga was floating in ecstasy
Shit, I took the pill, couldn't feel nothing so I'm breaking
But about thirty more minutes later, nigga was on the couch fainted
Arms sweaty, man why in the fuck y'all let me do this?
I'm looking at my home girl like I want her, nigga this some new shit
I realized, nigga took one step and started stumbling
And I was trying to call my nigga but he couldn't hear me, so I guess I'm mumbling
Fall off into something, but I guess I'm on a mission
Telling my niggas that I love 'em now but it ain't nobody listening
Whistling, hanging out the window, need me some indo
'Till I let go, like, me silky fine-ine, ine
Flown the expo, knock, knock, knock at the door
But nigga was paranoid, so I grabbed my gun bucked it at the door
Ooh-wee, shit happens, my family got me faded
But I'm running a secret cous', 'cause a nigga can't take it
Shake it, if I can but I blend in with the killers
And I wish ""E"" was here to feel pillish (Pillish, pillish)
I feel so violent, violent fucking with that ecstasy (Come roll with me)
I feel so violent, violent fucking with that ecstasy
I feel so violent, violent fucking with that ecstasy (Come roll with me)
I feel so violent, violent fucking with that ecstasy
I've been smoking weed for a very long time, why should I change?
And plus they say that ecstasy shit fucks up the brain (Brain)
Ah, why should I, just to get high, weed gets me high (Weed gets me high)
""Nigga try this here,"" they said ""better then that there""
They say, ""ya like it (ya like it)"" so I tried it (I tried it)
I thought the shit'll have a nigga high and horny
I'm high, but I'm too high, I want to hurt somebody
Nigga you tripping, get a hold of that shit, and ride that high
But I'm tripping, body moves, won't nobody get hurt (Hurt)
Groaning, groaning, groaning and she ain't even in the car
Layzie won't believe we high off the LSD
Would ya slow down, we riding on the highway
Get the wheel so I can go down on ya, I sever it on my own way
She reaching feeling so zigidy zigidy zigidy
Got these bitches, fucking them bitches
Baby be peeled off, peeling on, moving slow
And Bizzy be rock hard, tongue well and mean slow
We in the club drunk, fucked up, and still rolling
They know my pockets swollen, hold up, show them we rolling
We rolling, rolling, rolling and rolling, rolling, rolling
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy and we rolling on that ecstasy
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy and we rolling on that ecstasy
And we rolling on that ecstasy, and we rolling on that ecstasy
And we rolling on that ecstasy, and we rolling on that ecstasy

education,the kinks,"In a deep dark jungle long time ago
Lived a lonesome caveman
He was a solitary soul
And he spent his playtime
Chewing meat from bones.
He didn't know how to talk much
He only knew how to groan
Then he lifted up his hands and reached to the sky
Let out a yell and no one replied.
Frustration and torment tore him inside
Then he fell to the ground and he cried and he cried.
But then education saved the day.
He learned to speak and communicate
Education saved the day.
He thanked God for the friends he made.
'Cause everybody needs an education
Everybody needs an education.
Black skin, red skin, yellow or white,
Everybody needs to read and write
Everybody needs an education.

Thank the day when that primitive man
Learned to talk with his brothers
And live off the land.
He left his cave and he moved far away
And he lived with his friends in a house that they'd made
He learned to think and to work with his brain
And he astounded his friends with all the knowledge he gained

He wrote it down on a rock that he found
And he showed all his friends and they passed it around
And then education came that day.
The day it came was a sacred day.
Education came that day
He thanked God for the friends he'd made.

Well man built a boat and he learned how to sail
And he travelled far and wide
Then he looked up above saw the stars in the sky
So he learned how to fly.
Thanks to all the mathematicians
And the inventors with their high I.Q.s
And the professors in their colleges
Trying to feed me knowledge
That I know I'll never use.
Thank you sir for the millions of words
That you've handed me down and you've told me to learn

But I've got words in my ears and my eyes
I've got so many facts that I must memorize
Because education's doing me in
I want to stop but my head's in a swim
Education drives me insane
I can't recall all the facts on my brain.
Education came that day
The day it came was a sacred day
Education saved the day
He thanked God for all the friends he made.

Teacher, teach me how to read and write,
You can teach me about biology,
But you can't tell me what I am living for
'Cause that's still a mystery.
Teacher, teach me about nuclear physics
And teach me about the structure of man,
But all your endless calculations
Can't tell me why I am.
No you can't tell me why I am,
No you can't tell me why I am.

Everybody needs education,
Open Universities, education.
Every race every creed, education.
And every little half-breed, education.
Every nationality, education.
All the little people need education.
Eskimos and pygmies need
And even aborigines, education.

Well physics and geography, education.
Philosophy and history, education.
Science and biology, education,
Geometry and poetry, education.
Well, education, education, education, education"

For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal

Oh, I'm in love

Knows all my secrets
I'll never fall in love again
I drift with dunes
I whisper of the tombs

Lives in a dream

Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people

Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave

It's coal-black
I am tired of the gulping that you do
Every day a new face
What if i unscrew
Your own identity
Wouldn't you guess there's nothing left of you?
The quicksand of life drags us
Down into the circle
One day. we might not catch you
I feel sorry for what you try to do
Breaking others down. to try and to pursue
Your own selfish interests
I am starting to get sick of you
Whatever happened ever since you left
You make yourself and me look like fools"

And when you think you've sinned
Do you fall upon your knees?
Or do you sit within your picture?
Do you still forget the breeze?

And she may rise, if I sing you down
And she may wisely cling to the ground
'Cause I am lately horny
So why would she take me horny?

What's the point of this song? Or even singing?
You've already gone, why am I clinging?
Well I could throw her out, and I could live without
And I could do it all for you
I could be true
Tell me if you want me to lie
'Cause this has got to die

I said this has got to stop
This has got to lie down, down

You can both keep me pinned

Feel the future

She will tear you apart just as soon as you let her

She's elusive I'm awake
Defiantly real there's nothing fake
A mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes as I'm next to you
She says my destiny lies in the hands that set me free

A wreckless night she hears me breathe
Cursing the skies of this company
You've lost the wisdom deep inside
Her bitterness shows its side

If it's true I am doomed
What more is there to hold on to
A strand of hair is all I own
A gift to me this sorry soul

She's elusive I'm awake
Defiantly real there's nothing fake
A mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes as I'm next to you
She says my destiny lies in the hands that set me free

Something says this ain't right
There's more to her than meets the eye
She comes and goes at any time
Back in my head to another time

She's elusive I'm awake
Defiantly real there's nothing fake
A mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes as I'm next to you
She says my destiny lies in the hands that set me free"

Right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash box, 560 State Street
Catch me in the Kitchen like a Simmons with them pastries

Cruising down 8th Street, off white Lexus
Driving so slow but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me

Say what up to Ty Ty, still sipping Mai Tais
Sitting courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high five
Jigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

In New York (hey)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do (yeah)
Now you're in New York (you're in New York)
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you (come on)
Let's hear it for New York (you welcome, OG)
New York, New York (I made you hot, jigga)

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Dude, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of brothers walking with my clique though

Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we selling rock
Afrika Bambaataa, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't, for they act like they forgot how to act

Eight million stories, out there in it naked
City is a pity, half of y'all won't make it
Me, I gotta plug Special Ed, ""I got it made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade

Three dice cee-lo, three-card Marley
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the kingdom I'm from the Empire State that's

In New York (hey)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do (that boy good)
Now you're in New York (you're in New York)
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York (uh), New York (yeah), New York (uh)

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
Lined with casualties who slip through life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve

Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue, with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity on the whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them

Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end

Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
Dub, MHS got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

In New York (yeah, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made, oh
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York (you're in New York)
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York (uh), New York (yeah), New York (uh)

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
Yeah, yeah (come on), yeah, yeah

In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York (New York, New York)
These streets will make you feel brand new (brand new)
Big lights will inspire you

You'll have your scientist expert nuclear physicist
Saying that he can't explain
Maybe it's a meteor nuclear bomb missile launch
A final plague acid rain
Then he'll tell you it's the last day of your life
And you must not leave your home
There'll be millions of people all around the world
Praying to the CNN god alone

But I'm gonna dance And I'm gonna sing
When I hear those words said
I'm gonna smash my favorite guitar
Burn every book I've ever read
Then I'm gonna gather all my friends together
We'll get drunk and we'll get high
And then we'll chain smoke cigarettes
It doesn't matter 'cos we're all gonna die

I'm gonna tear down the main city street
In a stolen police car
Record the world's trashiest song
And make myself a star
Then I'm gonna come back home and sit and think
About every word I've said
Take a photo of myself as a souvenir
'Cos by the end of the day I'll be dead

And then I'll come round to your place
With a flower and a song
I'm gonna rest my tired head in your lap
And cry about all the things I've done wrong
Then I'm gonna look at you just one last time
And smile at the life I chose
Then let one final tear past my eye

And head on home
Outside my window there's a cat in heat
Shut up, cat, and leave me alone

There ain't no heat on round here
I don't feel nothing now
Not even fear
Now that end times are here

Now everyone's crazy, they've lost their minds

It could all be over at any old time

For sweetness alone who flew out through the window
And landed back home in a garden of green

You're a riding alone in the back of steamer
And steaming yourself in the warm shower spray
And water rolls on off the round captain's belly
Who's talking to tigers from his cafeteria tray

And sweet babies cry for the cool taste of milking
That milky delight that invited us all
And if there's a taste in this life more inviting
Then wake up your windows and watch as the sweet babies crawl

Well, I don't like to waste a chance but they're overflowing
What I don't do will get done by somebody

Whether seen forwards or back they'd keep going
They'd keep going

Whatever slips out of our hands
Will find its way back to us once again

I die a little
Ev'ry time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little

Why the Gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go

When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it

There's no love song finer
But how strange the change
From major to minor
Ev'ry time we say goodbye

When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it

There's no love song finer
But how strange the change
From major to minor
Ev'ry time we say goodbye"
evangeline,cocteau twins,"Don't settle for letting someone else define you
Know who you are at every age
What impression am I making?
I see me as other people see me

There is no going back
I can't stop feeling now
I am not the same, I'm growing up again
I am not the same
I'm growing up again
There's no going back I can't stop feeling now

I had to fantasize
I was a princess, Mum and Dad were Queen and King
I ought to have what feeling?
I see me as other people see me

There is no going back
I can't stop feeling now
I am not the same, I'm growing up again
I am not the same
I'm growing up again
There's no going back I can't stop feeling now

Feeling now

There is no going back, and
I can't stop feeling now
I am not the same, I'm growing up again
I am not the same
I'm growing up again
There's no going back I can't stop feeling now

I had to fantasize
Just to survive
I was a famous artist
Everybody took me seriously

Even those who did
Never understood me
I had to fantasize
Just to survive"
ever after,joe jackson,"Now that you're gone
Nothing is wrong
But everything's changed
Words in your hand
Do I set them in stone
Or throw them away
Now everything we did
Like photographs that always moved
(And that wasn't strange)
Now they're in the can
Let's put them on a shelf
Let's put them in the ground
They'll never move again

Ever after
Ever after
Ever after

Over and done
All of the fun
And all of the pain
Why don't I laugh
Why don't I cry
It ends up all the same
Now that you're gone
Everything is wrong
Though nothing has changed
And everything we said
Is there on a tape
For the future to play
Let's put it in the ground
That's where it ought to stay

Ever after
Ever after
Ever after

And it'll be all right . . ."
everest,cave in,"I hear things I tried to say
Echo back to me the opposite way
Everything I've read spinning round my head
Let's escape to where the air is cold and thin

Oh, I might have believed in a miracle once, Everest
Oh, I might have believed, though I'm feeling deceived
And for all I care
I don't want to know

Ghosts are dancing around the mime
Haunted by the sense of passing time
Dreamers know the way to survive the day
They'll escape the where the air is cold and thin

Oh, I might have believed in a miracle once, Everest
Oh, I might have believed, though I'm feeling deceived
And for all I care
I don't want to know

All the film has been exposed
In my photographic memory, I suppose
When it rain, it pours
Screaming through the doors
Every pain and pent-up eyesore I recall

Oh, I might have believed in a miracle once, Everest
Oh, I might have believed, though I'm feeling deceived
And for all I care
I don't want to know

Oh, I might have believed in a miracle once, Everest
Oh, I might have believed, though now I'm feeling deceived
And for all I care
I don't want to know
I don't want to know"

every river,kim richey,"Once upon a time
Somewhere in your past
Someone said forever
But that promise didn't last

Now you don't believe
Love is ever true
You steel yourself against the day
When I stopped loving you

When the day comes that I don't love you
Every star will fall out of the sky
And every mountain will tumble down
And every river run dry

For every drop of rain
That ever touched the ground
For every tear that ever fell
And never made a sound

I'll be there
To hear you call
And I'll be there to catch you, baby
Should you ever fall

When the day comes that I don't love you
Every star will fall out of the sky
Every mountain will tumble down
Every river run dry

When the day comes that I don't love you
Every star will fall out of the sky
Every mountain will tumble down
Every river run dry

Every river run dry"
every time,janet jackson,"I'm afraid, I'm starting to feel
What I said I would not do
The last time really hurt me
I'm scared to fall in love

Afraid to love so fast
'Cause everytime I fall in love
It seems to never last

But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
My heart does begin to race everytime

One half wants me to go
One half wants me to stay
I just get so all confused
I'm scared to fall in love

Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last

But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time
My heart does begin to race everytime

I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast

And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
My heart does begin to race everytime

It's everytime
It's everytime

'Cause everytime your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
Could it be that this will be the one that lasts?
The fear does start to erase everytime
Ohhh could it be that this will be the one that lasts
For all my times
Ohhh yeah.
For all my times"

everybody knows,concrete blonde,"Everybody knows the dice are loaded

Everybody knows that the war is over

Everybody knows the fight is fixed
The poor stay poor and the rich get rich
That's how it goes

Everybody knows that the captain lied

everybody loves somebody,frank sinatra,"Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
(That) my sometime is now
Everybody finds somebody someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
(That) my someplace is here
If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I've found in your arms
Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you"
everybody's changing,keane,"You say, you wander your own land
But when I think about it, I don't see how you can

You're aching, you're breaking
And I can see the pain in your eyes
Says Everybody's Changing, and I don't know why

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
I try to stay awake and remember my name
But Everybody's Changing, and I don't feel the same

You're gone from here
Soon you will disappear, fading into beautiful light
'Cause Everybody's Changing, and I don't feel right

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
I try to stay awake and remember my name
But Everybody's Changing, and I don't feel the same

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
I try to stay awake and remember my name
But Everybody's Changing, and I don't feel the same
Oh, Everybody's Changing, and I don't feel the same"
everybody's free (to wear sunscreen),baz luhrmann,"Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of '99
Wear Sunscreen
If I could offer you only one tip for the future,
Sunscreen would be it
The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists
Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience...
I will dispense this advice now...

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth
Oh nevermind;
You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded
But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself
And recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before
You and how fabulous you really looked...

You are not as fat as you imagine
Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as
Effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that
Never crossed your worried mind

The kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday

Do one thing everyday that scares you

Sing
Don't be reckless with other people's hearts

Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours

Floss
Don't waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind...

The race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself
Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults

If you succeed in doing this, tell me how

Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements

Stretch
Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life...
The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives
Some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't

Get plenty of calcium
Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're gone
Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding
Anniversary...
What ever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's

Enjoy your body

Use it every way you can...

Don't be afraid of it, or what other people think of it

It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own

Dance... even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room
Read the directions, even if you don't follow them
Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly

Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good
Be nice to your siblings
They are the best link to your past
And the people most likely to stick with you in the future

Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on
Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle

Because the older you get
The more you need the people you knew when you were young
Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard
Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft
Travel
Accept certain inalienable truths
Prices will rise
Politicians will philander
You too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young
Prices were reasonable
Politicians were noble
And children respected their elders
Respect your elders
Don't expect anyone else to support you
Maybe you have a trust fund
Maybe you have a wealthy spouse
But you never know when either one might run out
Don't mess too much with your hair
Or by the time you're 40, it will look 85
Be careful whose advice you buy, but
Be patient with those who supply it
Advice is a form of nostalgia
Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off
Painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth
But trust me on the sunscreen"
everyday,buddy holly,"Everyday, it's a-gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster

Love like yours will surely come my way

Every way, love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for
True love from me?

everything flows,teenage fanclub,"See you get older every year
But you don't change
Or I don't notice you changing

I think about it every day

And then a feeling

I'll never know which way to flow
Set a course that I don't know

I'll never know which way to flow
Set a course that I don't know

The wind's blowing in my face
Lately found it hard to keep the pace

And I'm looking for a place to go
But only for a little while
And then a feeling

I'll never know which way to flow

everything i wanted,billie eilish,"I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care

Thought I could fly (fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say
""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
It could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there

And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say
""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?"

We'll never come back

Go back in time
I wish I could go back
Back in time

Those people are evil
And it's hard to understand
I'll never understand

I wish I could go back
Go back in time (go back in time)
But no one ever really can
Go back in time

Those people are evil
And they'll hurt you if they can

excalibur,rhapsody,"Septimum / nunc veni
Sigillum / et vide

Ego usurato
D'uomo ferito
Tra orgoglio e peccato
La forza del mito

Sinful, bleeding
A new life's meaning
Your glare's healing
My broken feelings
In the shades of avalon's dark reign

The last word of an immortal skylord
Hidden in the tears of fallen angels
Will reveal the wonders of my heaven
At the dawn of a new eternity
Shines the mighty blade of destiny

L'antico inganno
Al cor mai svelato
L'eroico furore
Di un dio tormentato

Sacred fire
Gloria in profundis
Divine wisdom
My axis mundi
Mental nexus between earth and sky

The last word of an immortal skylord
Hidden in the tears of fallen angels
Will reveal the wonders of my heaven
At the dawn of a new eternity
Shines the mighty blade of destiny

Ego sum unus et vivus fui mortuus
Sum vivens in saecula saeculorum
In meo sanguine libero te
Domine quando corpus morietur
Fac ut animae gloria donetur
Excalibur

Septimum / nunc veni
Sigillum / et vide

Della terra il fuoco e il gelo
Delle acque il mormorar
Della rune il suo segreto
E dal druido il suo vibrar

Al furor di vento e mar
Mano ardita scegliera'
E dal pianto di un infante
La leggenda nascera'

""an age-old nemesis
Is stalking through time itself
To hunt down the only one
Who can stand in its way""

Honor et virtus
Sacrus gladius
Excalibur

Only one will brandish the great sword of power
Riding winds of hope
Only one will unify the kingdoms
And will serve the angels' word
Hail the glory of excalibur

Ego sum unus et vivus fui mortuus
Sum vivens in saecula saeculorum
In meo sanguine libero te
Domine quando corpus morietur
Fac ut animae gloria donetur

existence,august burns red,"This hollow feeling, the knowledge that you exist
Amidst your insecurities, cover up only to coward out
And never shutting up only to never speak aloud
Have you dried up entirely?
The walls of a church don't make it holy
It's what's authentic that completes the sum of it's parts
Don't excuse yourself from life today on the pretense of your past
You're hurt, you're broken, that's alright
This might be what it takes to wake you up
This might be what it takes to wake you up
Are you at your wits end yet?
Are you at your wits end yet?
Are you at your wits end?
Are you at your wits end yet?
The walls of a church don't make it holy
Security isn't glitzy or glamorous, concrete or cohesive
Therein lies the truth, lift your head up high
It's what we know we aren't that makes us who we are
It's what we know we aren't that makes us who we are
You're hurt, you're broken, that's alright
That makes us who we are
You're hurt, you're broken, that's alright

exit,dismantled,"Faced the crowd
In a blind mirror
Skull smashed headfirst
Against this wall of inner need
I knew this fall
Would send it all down towards the lights
And they will question once more
From their unscathed towers

I'll answer:
Go on and force
Your one-bit truth until the end
I'll swallow every bullet
That rips through the hull
A sheltered life crawls forward, vomits
And folds around twin blades
I pull it back like last time
Yet it never cuts through all the way
I always have to take it hostage

Whenever I feel
I find no way to begin
It always bled from within
They fed the dreams so it could rip

Whenever I feel
I find no way to begin
I've grown content in this dream
I'll let those others take and give

And if I had:
Leaned forward and let their downpours mask
Preburned fields growing supports for a future set in past
Every reflection would lie and every breath would climb blind
Toward their shallow corpse of a self-lit sky
And just its weight would be enough
To send it all off the edge towards that same undecided mind
Towards that self-absorbed conscience that only screams
So predictably:

""Someone burn me an exit""

Stormed their black-rise tower looming past
Drove them all out into a corner
Of the memory gridmap
Airlocked and silenced, I kept holding back
Finally burned them all alive
Before cutting off my own blood supply
I knew they had it bypassed to a bloodthirsty human mass
That infested with a false promise of a chance
And held a freedom already dried up and past"
explosions,frodus,"We like explosions
We like explosions that leave you feeling good
We like ideas that change the world for good

Yes

Oh yeah

We like new places that jets can't take you to
We do like music when it does what it should do
We like explosions, it's only right we should

We like new places until they're overrun
We do like music, loud shots from the big spudgun"

Putting them in piles and burning 'em up
The flames got higher, they were out of control
I was hosing 'em down when the cops showed up
It was extraordinary
Extraordinary
Now and then I must aspire
To go out of the ordinary
And set the world on fire

Strange things happen on a Saturday night
Boys meet girls and they all get tight
The dance floor shakes as the trap kit moves
The crowd gets caught like a needle in a groove
It feels extraordinary
Extraordinary
Baby, if you wanna be out of the ordinary
Come on and dance with me!

I was doing 140 in my SUV
Cruising with my girl, it was twenty past three
I was talking about changing my cell phone plan
When my girl says, ""Baby, you're a boy, you're not a man
You're not extraordinary
Extraordinary
Baby, if you wanna be out of the ordinary
You don't need technology!""

I was at the post office buying a stamp
Thinking that the girl behind the counter was fine
I said ""You think this'll get there by Friday, ma'am?""
She says, ""I get off work at quarter past nine""

Extraordinary!
Extraordinary!
Baby, if you wanna be out of the ordinary

eye on you,billy squier,"I watch you on the tv--you're with me every place I go
I'm caught up in the daydream--I'm into everyone you know
Turn on the action--grab every minute
Learn every lesson--then live to regret it
I'm so distracted--my mind's disengaged
Sharin' the moments when you're all the rage

I got my eyes on you
Got my eye on you...

Those overnight conditions always get the best of you
You're fuelin' my suspicions--I'm taken by the sneak preview
You got the numbers--you got no limits
One day you're out but the next day you're in it
You find the answers--you know what to say
Give us our reasons for livin' today

I got my eyes on you
Got my eye on you...

We share the laughter and pain when you're in it
Bring on disaster--cause we know you'll win it
We're all believers--so watch what you say
Turn on those feelin's... I can't look away

I got my eyes on you
Got my eye on you"

that deafens me
when it crashes in my ear
it's an incessant calling
screaming out the way I
should be living.

Live thoughts are exploding
in my brain, I see inside a great hollow
if I could ever end that life

I would do it, it's not a lie.

Hypocrisy is the beast that is hunting you
when you're gonna realize
it drives you finally to feel
aversion of the skin.

Distorting my mind
they hate me for my skin
though they want me to stop
I'll keep on being.

I can't change my instincts,
I create my faith
I defy your intentions face to face
my existence offends your trivial hate
I defy your intentions face to face.

Face to face, I have no fear"

But to me it doesn't matter they, fade away they fade away.
Fade away.
When we meet we feel together, now she's gone I can't forget her.
Love is chance but time won't let her, fade away and fade away.
Fade away, fade away.
A lot of flowers in this world are never seen.
I want to hold your love, I want to win your love for me.
Fade away.
For me there was no sunshine, for me there was no rain.
For me until I meet you, every day was the same.

Except for the few lovers
Entangled and torn from the hour
The stars now are starting to leave
A silent moon begins to weep
And the lovers fall further and further
Into the dark and deep
Come morning, without warning
The absence of love's embrace
Like winter's light, it creeps on in
And the moon's tears fade
He starts the car and is driving away
Hearing her voice and tasting their last kiss
That sent them spinning and racing
The moon's glow lights the way
Otherwordly underwater dreamscape
Till a semi's headlights invade
Come morning, without warning
The absence of love's embrace
Like winter's light, it creeps on in
And the moon's sullen glow is fading
The glow is fading
The glow is fading
Soul escaping
Stars are leaving, the moon is weeping
Soul escaping
Soul escaping
Racing through the night...
The glow is fading
The glow is fading"

And the big wheel keeps on turning round and round
Into eternity with me to cosmic meadows
I will be there with all my friends.

No, I don't feel like I'm falling
No, I don't feel like I'm falling down
Just say hello to the ground

We could talk if days weren't so fast
And mistakes just leave it so unsure
Wanna hold you like never before
'Cause we're falling and I love you more and more

Do you feel like you're falling down?
Do you feel like you're falling down?
I don't feel like I'm falling, falling, falling down

I don't feel like I'm falling
No, I don't feel like I'm falling
No, I don't feel like I'm falling down
Just say hello to the ground

I don't feel like I'm falling
No, I don't feel like I'm falling
No, I don't feel like I'm falling down

Do you feel like you're falling down?
Do you feel like you're falling down?
I don't feel like I'm falling, falling, falling
Just say hello to the ground"
fallin,macklemore,"I swear I've been here before, there's a war in my heart
Inside my chest is a thorn it's been torn from the start
The picture painted warped, the hearts aching and scarred
Music's the band-aid I'm too afraid to take this shit off
Another drink at the bar but I'm not drunk enough
Each shot burns less but the chest isn't numbin' up
A voice keeps talkin' in my head and I'ma fuck him up
Fill the gun with lead and bust until the pump shuts him up
Emos and rockers and rockers and emos
Another shot of some vodka to get myself up off of my ego
There's a door to my conscious, I can't unlock it or see the peephole
This angel held my baggage and then vanished like ""Where did she go?""
I was beside her but I was walking by myself though
Break the silence with my cell phone it doesn't help though
I can't believe this is happening, sinking into depression
I've been here before and now I'm back again

I keep fallin', I keep fallin', I keep fallin', down the rain
Keeps pourin', keeps pourin', I don't know if I can get up today
Keep fallin', I keep fallin', fallin', down the rain
Keeps pourin', keeps pourin', I don't know if I can get up today

6 AM hung over leaving my booty call watch the sunrise
Head over I-5 headed North but there's no sign of sunshine
Empty brandy bottles spilled on the forgotten memories
Know I gotta let it go I'm just to selfish to set it free
Like forced release, two hours later I just got up and bounced
If she could only see me now head lost swallowed and drowned
The path is up but I followed it down
A man gone and hollowed out because you opened it up
You can't start over now
What's to keep going for?
Validated by drunken whores
Bloody knuckles so numb and sore from punching these rusty doors
Freeway signs underpasses, man stranded, dusty mattress
This world is bipolar, beautiful for some for others the fuckin' saddest
So sick of lugging baggage
All I got is drugs and alcohol and these cuts of passion
Brain serenade razor blade punk madness
Pain is love, plug the drain but the rain keeps crashing like

I keep fallin', I keep fallin', I keep fallin', down the rain
Keeps pourin', keeps pourin', I don't know if I can get up today
Keep fallin', I keep fallin', fallin', down the rain
Keeps pourin', keeps pourin', I don't know if I can get up today"

I am the book and you are the binding

Stick to love songs kid, that's all you're knowing
They push you away or tie you up
It don't really matter
But if your head is up, you won't get much sadder

But who am I to preach a word or two
When I can't lift my own head without you?
If my mental state kept you from coming around
I hope the world would shoot me down for losing you
A broken branch I'd be if you weren't grown to me

famous last words,peter hammill,"""If I close my eyes I can pretend
the best is still before me, the worst is at an end.
Time for goodbyes to the audiences that adored me;
they never realised
just how much I came to despise all their eagerness.""

Famous last words,
made in jest, overheard,
is that your best testament?
Or are you coining a phrase
just to see how it plays
when you're at your wits' end.
Famous last words,
to the last you'll self-serve,
what a waste of your breath.

When you close your eyes will you pretend
that nothing bad has happened, that we are still close friends?
So many lies, after all the illusions are shattered
still at all costs you must hide
the emptiness where your true feelings used to reside.

Famous last words,
they're so over-rehearsed –
they just sound like pretence.
You'll go out in style,
to the last in denial
of what anything's meant.
Famous last words,
to the last you'll self-serve,
what a waste of all that breath.

(It's a little too late for sorry...
in a race against the clock
now you hit that mental block
time to take that poison cup
now your time is all used up.)"

far from home,neil young,"When I was a growing boy
A-rocking on my daddy's knee
Daddy took an old guitar and sang
Bury me on the lone prairie

Uncle Bob sat at the piano
My girl cousins sang harmony
Those were the good old family times
That left a big mark on me

Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
Where the Canada geese once filled the sky
And then I won't be far from home

Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
You won't have to shed a tear for me
'Cause then I won't be far from home

Walking down the trans-Canada highway
I was talking to a firefly
Trying to make my way to Nashville, Tennessee
When another car passed me by

Some day I'm gonna make big money
And buy myself a big old car
Make my way on down to that promised land
And then I'm gonna really go far

Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
Where the Canada geese once filled the sky
And then I won't be far from home

Just bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
You won't have to shed a tear for me
'Cause then I won't be far from home"

Fascination dream of you

Such devotion
I've never felt before
You opened up a door in my life

No tomorrow
Could there be without you
And if you should say goodbye
I think that I would die

Fascination dream of you

Hey... livin in the fast lane
Drivin fast 'broads'
With them fast 'chains'
When you pimpin through life
See some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
With some people they shoot up
Hey. there it goes again
Different face to the same old tragic end
Who's to blame if he never saw it commin
Yet he heard the bullet hummin
And he never though of runnin
It's too late for him now layin out on the ground so cold. so cold
Nothin much to live up to. damn
It's so far gone. so gone

Livin in the fast lane
Drivin fast broads
With you fast chains
When you pimpin through life
See some people got caught up
With some charges brought up
From some people they shoot up
Hey. tell me when will it end
When the baby pays for its mothers sinnin
Trapped inside the four walls of a 'penty'
Way too strong. way too strong
Now shes out in the cold, dying slow and the spoon still warm

It started when they birthed me
Runnin round stuck in the project now he cant wait to the first come
Little older now and cant wait till the dope come
Sleep all these years and nobody awoke him
Getting it so he can cover the whole border
Question is how many of us can hold water
It seemed like tellin is in
Signed states get an order of protection and tell him again
I'm a left lane
My life is much faster than yours
I'm with a chick and its attached to a brawl
Got the air ones matchin the car
All white. slingin all night
So we rapidly spar
Thats what they wanna clap at me for
Understand that the flow is like the coke that he naturally grows
So I'ma get my cash on, and my mash on
And get my ass up out of the fast lane

I am idiot drug hive, the virgin, the tattered and the torn
Life is for the cold made warm, and they are just lizards
Self-disgust is self-obsession, honey, and I do as I please
A morality obedient, only to the cleansed repented

A truth that washes that learned how to spell

Soft skin now acne, foul breath, so broken
He loves me truly, this mute solitude I'm draining
I know I believe in nothing but it is my nothing

Sleep can't hide the thoughts splitting through my mind
Shadows aren't clean, false mirrors, too many people awake

Where he lives,
His son has died.
He stares at his wife, the woman
Who held his boy inside,

What words I know can dry her face.

february,dar williams,"I threw your keys in the water, I looked back
They'd frozen halfway down in the ice
They froze up so quickly, the keys and their owners
Even after the anger, it all turned silent and
The everyday turned solitary
So we came to February

First we forgot where we planted those bulbs last year
Then we forgot that we'd planted at all
Then we forgot what plants are altogether
And I blamed you for my freezing and forgetting and
The nights were long and cold and scary
Can we live through February?

You know I think Christmas was a long red glare
Shot up like a warning, we gave presents without cards
And then the snow
And then the snow came, we were always out shovelling
And we'd drop to sleep exhausted
And we'd wake up and it's snowing

And February was so long that it lasted into March
And found us walking a path alone together
You stopped and pointed and you said ""that's a crocus""
And I said ""what's a crocus?"" and you said ""it's a flower""
I tried to remember but I said ""what's a flower?""
You said ""I still love you""

The leaves were turning as we drove to the hardware store
My new lover made me keys to the house
And when we got home, well we just started chopping wood
Because you never know how next year will be
And we'll gather all our arms can carry
I have lost to February"

feel flows,the beach boys,"Unfolding, enveloping missiles of soul
Recall senses sadly
Mirage like soft blue, like lanterns below
To light the way gladly
Whether whistling heaven's clouds disappear
Whether wind withers memory
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away

Feel flows (White puff, glistening, shadowy flow)
Feel goes (Black puff, glistening, shadowy glow)

Unbending, never ending tablets of time
Record all the yearning
Unfearing, all appearing message divine
Eases the burning
Whether willing witness waits at my mind
Whether hope dampens memory
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side

Feel flows (White puff, glistening, shadowy flow)
Feel goes (Black puff, glistening, shadowy glow)

Encasing, all-embracing wreath of repose
Engulfs all the senses
Imposing, unclosing thoughts that compose
Retire the fences
Whether wholly-heartened life fades away
Whether harps heal the memory
Whether wholly-heartened life fades away
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away

Feel goes (White puff, glistening, shadowy flow)
Feel flows (Black puff, glistening, shadowy glow)
Feel goes (White puff, glistening, shadowy flow)
Feelings to grow (White puff, glistening, shadowy flow)

White puff, glistening, shadowy glow
White puff, glistening, shadowy glow

feel it,neneh cherry,"Luck has been on your side boy,
And life is what you made it
As you've done what you can do
People say
People say that your the only one
Time keeps slipping thru the hour class
You're living in the future boy
But there something inside
Something to hide
In too much pride
Maybe you cried
Wondering why
You know you've got to feel it
Feel it over you, under you
Talking to your little sister now
Tell her how you turned to liquid love
Don't get beaten by the tide boy
You've got so much to give of yourself
Some of the things you said
Been living in your head you know
And what you feel
Are just trade marks of your suffering
But you're looking for a reason for everything
'Coz you know that there has to be something in
Every little thing that you're
Feeling feeling feeling feeling, over you
Voices on your shoulder
Pounding in your temple
Like a bullet in your head
Waiting for release
Your simplistic measures
Your holistic treasures
What you want and what you need
What you feel in your dreams
Been around and fought a lot of wars
Before you could walk
But then again you walked
A lot of miles before you could talk
And now you know that you feel it
What you gonna

Feel it, feel it, feel it

femme fatale,agonoize,"Du, und immer nur du – du, und immer nur du – du Fotze!

Nachts werde ich wach – und ich spüre in mir das Verlangen nach dir
Nachts werde ich wach – ich bin hoch erregt, doch du bist nicht bei mir

Du – du kamst in meine Welt, du hast sie durchgewühlt und auf den Kopf gestellt
Du – du hast mich nur benutzt, du hast mich ausgequetscht und nach Bedarf beschmutzt
Du – du hast mich angefixt, du hast dich prostituiert und ich hab abgespritzt
Du – du hast mich flachgelegt, drum nimm mich noch mal, du weißt ja wie es geht

Du warst so affektiert und ich wohl nur blasiert
Ich dachte du wärst dumm und denkst nur unten rum
Hätt ich mich bloß geziert und nur noch masturbiert
Unterschätze nie die Macht der Pornokratie
Du hast mich in der Hand, das hab ich jetzt erkannt
Denn so ne Libido fand ich noch nirgendwo
Wie viel Zeit mir bleibt, weiß nur dein Unterleib
Gib mir den Gnadenstoß aus deinem Mutterschoß

Fick mich noch einmal – heut Nacht

Du, und immer nur du – du, und immer nur du – du Fotze!

Ich sah nur dein Sexappeal, ich war völlig hohl, du hattest leichtes Spiel
Ich, ich renne hinter dir her, doch du bist eiskalt und reitest mich nicht mehr
Ich hab mir die Finger verbrannt, deine Kurven verdrängten meinen Verstand
Und schwanzgesteuert hoff ich, dass du mich verführst
Sabber Tag und Nacht, während ich mich berühr

Du warst so affektiert und ich wohl nur blasiert
Ich dachte du wärst dumm und denkst nur unten rum
Hätt ich mich bloß geziert und nur noch masturbiert
Unterschätze nie die Macht der Pornokratie
Du hast mich in der Hand, das hab ich jetzt erkannt
Denn so ne Libido fand ich noch nirgendwo
Wie viel Zeit mir bleibt weiß nur dein Unterleib
Gib mir den Gnadenstoß aus deinem Mutterschoß

Fick mich noch einmal – heut Nacht"

De réveiller des gens
J't'inventerai une famille
Juste pour ton enterrement

Et puis si j'étais l'Bon Dieu
Je crois que je ne serais pas fier
Je sais on fait ce qu'on peut
Mais y a la manière

Tu sais je reviendrai
Je reviendrai souvent
Dans ce putain de champ
Où tu dois te reposer

L'été je te ferai de l'ombre
On boira du silence
À la santé d'Constance
Qui se fout bien d'ton ombre

Et puis les adultes sont tellement cons
Qu'ils nous feront bien une guerre
Alors je viendrai pour de bon
Dormir dans ton cimetière

Et maintenant bon Dieu
Tu vas bien rigolé
Et maintenant bon Dieu
Et maintenant j'vais pleurer"

In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

Will you stay with me, will you be my love
Among the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold

I never made promises lightly
There have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

Man that send me off
Let them take the cure
Don't need a cure
Need a final solution
Buy me a ticket to a sonic reduction
Guitars gonna sound like a nuclear destruction
Seems I'm a victim of natural selection
Meet me on the other side, another direction
Don't need a cure
Need a final solution"
finally,kings of tomorrow,"Time marches on never ending
Time keeps its own time
Here we stand at beginning
And then goes passing us by

And I, I
I can dream for us all
I hope I'm in a better state
When here and now crumbles and falls

And you, you
You who make worlds collide
I knew you'd come knocking one day
Unannounced like a thief in the night

Where do we go from here
Time ain't nothing but time
I now have no fear of my fears
And no more tears to cry

Tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow means nothing at all
If we don't hear the line
When today places its call

And morning, morning
Morning won't ever be the same
Now I won't make the same mistakes
Time and time again

Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again

So tell me how do you do
Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through
Waiting and wondering about you
I had a dream my trip would end up at you
And now I know paradise

Time marches on never ending
Time keeps its own time
Here we stand at beginning
And then goes passing us by

And I, I
I can dream for us all
I hope I'm in a better state
When here and now crumbles and falls

And you, oh you
You who make worlds collide
I knew you'd come knocking one day
Unannounced like a thief in the night

So tell me how do you do
Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through
Waiting and wondering about you
I had a dream my trip would end up at you
And now I know paradise

So tell me how do you do
Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through
Waiting and wondering about you
I had a dream my trip would end up at you
And now I know paradise"
finer feelings,kylie minogue,"The finer feelings, the finer feelings

You can't give to me
Anything, I couldn't get for myself
I have needs as much as any man
And I understand the feelings well

I can still have a true heart
With a free mind
A good life
With a good time

But what is love
Without the finer feelings
It's just sex
Without the sexual healing
Passion dies
Without some tender meanings
It ain't love
Without the finer feelings

I get passionate, just like you
But I have a little self-control
You just show your selfish attitude
Your emotion leaves me cold

I can still have a true heart
With a free mind
A good life
With a good time

But what is love
Without the finer feelings
It's just sex
Without the sexual healing
Passion dies
Without some tender meanings
It ain't love
Without the finer feelings

The finer, the finer

You don't have to worry don't you turn and run, run run
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
Standing in heaven but don't feel the light
The brightest colors are the black and white

You know the rhythm but can't feel the beat

You cry, you cry, you cry
When you feel everything's impossible

Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun

Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
You got it all but you don't feel complete
Even the sweetest things are bittersweet
You're riding high but you just fear the fall
Don't even recognize yourself at all
The night, the night, the night is full of tears
You cry, you cry, you cry
Sometimes this world can leave you in the cold
But everything will be

Lord knows I can feel her, see her, in my mind

Though I'm lost, I can hear them calling me there

Hey, the song, do you feel? (Feel)
Leave your light on through the night
Love (love) and loss so dear
You know it's a long way home

Well, a lonely road to the promised land
May be long but I see the end some day
To broken lives on the mountain side
Out in the cold, kinda hurried shifting sands

They're in the other world to where you lie
Pulling your heart then the ravens say goodbye

Hey, the song, do you feel?
And leave your light on through the night
Love (love) and loss so dear
You know it's a long way home"
fire and rain,james taylor,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus?
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows, when the cold wind blows
It'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line
To talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby
One more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now"

And I've had little trouble concealing the truth
I've been nothing but lies and deceitful

There for me, apologies have taken on a whole new meaning now

You've waited your whole life for this
Begged for mercy and forgiveness
Nothing up above but darkness and fire down below
And me and my friends waiting on your soul

It's been a long time since I've last had words with you
Not sure what I'd say now, to tell you the truth
I've had this feeling weighing heavily
On my mind and chest cavity
Don't pray for me, one day you'll find I'm sleeping in my urn, feeling just fine

You've waited your whole life for this
Begged for mercy and forgiveness
Nothing up above but darkness and fire down below
And me and my friends waiting on your soul

Fix me a drink, tell me a story
Take my head off these gut-wrenching worries
Make my mistakes my guilt admissions
Please pass the plate and the ammunition

My mom was just workin' to give me options
No live shows, 'cause I can't find sponsors
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert

You don't speak to the hood, man""
If I was given one chance I think I could, man
These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't cause they embarrassed
All I do is make the stuff I would've liked
Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite

Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And yous'a fake fuck like a fleshlight
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy
Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet Jay-Z?
Girls who used to tell me I ain't cool enough
Now text me pics sayin', ""You can tear this up""
I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry

Caught between the stars
A well lit drowning
Darkness mocks me with
A broken compass
So I swim in a sea
Of distress
Broken down, and helpless
The leper sits diseased

So leave your locks on the latches
If you bring the water
I'll bring the matches

'Cause we are fires in the night
We are fires in the night
Let us bathe you in our heart
'Cause we are fires in the night

We are fires in the night

fireworks,animal collective,"Now it's day I've been trying
To get that taste off my tongue
I was dreaming of just you
Now our cereal, it is warm
The track dead in a rubble
Of the night from the fall
Now I can't walk in a vacuum
I feel ugly, feel my pores
It's the trees, of this day
That I do battle with, for the light
Then I start to feel tragic, people greet me, I'm polite
""What's the day "" ""what are you doing? ""
""How's your mood?"" ""how's that song? ""
Man it passes right by me, it's behind me, now it's gone
And I can't lift you up, my mind is tired
It's family beaches that I desire
A sacred night, we watch the fireworks
The frightened babies through
They've got two flashing eyes and they're colored why
They make me feel that I'm only all I see sometimes
I've been eating with a good friend who said
""A genii made me out of the earth's skin""
But in spite of her she is my birth kin,
She spits me out in her surely blood rivers
All the people that lurking in dominions of a hot turk dish
If elephants are reaching for our purses
Then meet me after the world with the shivers

The warmth that see the chance

Shadows shaded yellow
Both shredded and tapered flames
Reaching at a constant level
Rising

Combustion

The blue light at the bottom
Surely sets the stage
For the radiant dancing
At the flares of the sun
Feel them burn

The heat that you feel is friction
Creating a scar that sees
An everlasting reflection
An everlasting appeal
Pain

For the first time in my whole life
I'm not afraid of feeling alive
For the last time i'm falling behind
And nothing out there will change my mind
Lets start over crimson clover
While these golden nights get colder
If i could press rewind
Turn on record and leave the past behind
Will we know the truth when we're older
For the first time in my whole life
I'm not afraid of feeling alive
For the last time i'm falling behind
And nothing out there will change my mind
If you find me
Will you remind me
We're one step closer
Two steps closer

You made a vow, never get mad
You play the game, though it's unfair
They're all the same, who can compare?
First you lose trust, then you get worried
Night after night, bar after club
Dropping like flies, who woke you up?
On the front lawn, sprinklers turn on
It's not your house, where'd you go wrong?
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

Flying like a cannonball, falling to the earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

There comes a time, in a short life
Turn it around, get a re-write
Call it a dark night of the soul
Ticking of clocks, gravity's pull

How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

You're going silent, the silent treatment
It's not inviting now
Don't deny what you meant
You get excited, you get excited
You got a feeling, or at least you can pretend
You wanna light it, you wanna light it
You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends
You get excited, you get excited

Pulling me closer, pushing away
And me, the sharpest thorn on your vine
Twisting and turning, we're all intertwined
Broken wing, empty glass
Words that scream and bounce right back
She says ""You know

I wish I could fix you
And make you how I want you
Wish I could fix you
And I wish you could fix me
I wish I could heal you
And mend where you are broken
I wish I could heal you
And I wish you could heal me

A beaming sunrise buries the night
The setting sun destroys the light
Then she says ""Baby, I've gotta get going""
Cutting each other without even knowing
She sees a million stars like holes in the sky
All god's tears for her they cry
And I am in her rain...

I was looking into the mirror
To see a little bit clearer
The rottenness and evil in me

And when I feel a bit naughty
I run it up the flagpole and see
Who salute but no one ever does

But, I'm not sick
But I'm not well
And I'm so hot
Cause I'm in hell

Been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding
The cretins cloning and feeding
And I don't even own a TV

Put me in the hospital for nerves and then they had to commit me
You told them all I was crazy
They cut off my legs now I'm an amputee
God damn you

And I'm so hot
Cause I'm in hell

But, I'm not sick
But, I'm not well
And it's a sin
To live so well

I wanna publish zines
And rage against machines
I wanna pierce my tongue
It doesn't hurt, it feels fine

The trivial sublime
I'd like to turn off time
And kill my mind
You kill my mind, mind

Paranoia, paranoia
Everybody's coming to get me
Just say you never met me
I'm running underground with the moles, (digging holes)

Hear the voices in my head
I swear to god it sounds like they're snoring
But if you're bored then you're boring
The agony and the irony, they're killing me (uhh ooo)

To strangers there's not enough time

Watching programmes you don't
Plan to watch they just come on
And if you had one chance to change
Would you review your plans?

'Cause there's not enough time
For one man in one life
Just a flicker and then a breeze
Breeze, breeze

Saved in a box
From going fast in cars
I've piled it up high
From saying hello to friends
With a quick goodbye

'Cause there's not enough time

flipside,everything but the girl,"London, summer '92:
I think I've changed a lot, since then. Do you?
Ideas that I'd held for years,
Emotional baggage, hopes and fears
Seen somehow in a different light:
Not as wrong, but not as right as they seemed before.
Was I different, then? Have I changed?
Will I change again?

I'm thinking of a mental free-fall,
A partial total memory recall
Like ""what of the future, what of the past, what of the present will last?"".
Say I did forget and revert to the old days, forget this hurt.
Am I better off or in reverse?
Untaught by experience and, therefore, worse?

I mean a lot, I mean a little.
I mean a lot, I mean a little.

I'm like a coastline, a beach and spit,
Spurn Point and the rest of it:
I'm the sea, the tide, the salt and foam.
I'm the blasted land, the sand shifting, drifting out and back
Then breached, drowned, defenses down,
Rebuilt from this day on, or maybe not:
Maybe my moment's gone.

I mean a lot, I mean a little.
I mean a lot, I mean a little.

Am I the same person I seemed to be?
Does all of this depress me?
I won't listen. I won't talk.
A weightless life. I moonwalk.
I mean a lot, I mean a little.
I'm supple, brittle, pig in the middle.
There's resilience inside my face, but sometimes nothing.
Deep space...

What I feel and what I fear
Is always here, my atmosphere.
Pig in the middle.

I mean a lot, I mean a little.
I mean a lot, I mean a little."

And I'm in church now
It's been one year since I sat behind a bar
I went by the junkyard,
And they've still got our car

I still see you on your knees
Begging me not to drive

I'm free for the first time

Feel so close to everything now
Strange how life makes sense in time now

Feels like I'm flying above you
Dream that I'm dying to find the truth
Seems that you're trying, trying, trying, trying
To bring me down
Back down to earth
Back down to earth
Back down to earth
Back down to earth
Back down"

focus,10 years,"Digging deeper in my mind
Can't get you out of my head
There's no way to describe
Just how you make me feel
I don't know
Is it love
I have lost control
Even when I'm gone
I can't get away

I can't Focus when I'm near you
Do you notice me at all
I can't Focus when I hear you
Do you notice I can't focus

Like the moth flies to the light
He's captured at first sight
I can't deny I'm taken by
The beauty in your eyes
I don't know
Is it love
I have lost control
Even when I'm gone
I can't get away

I can't Focus when I'm near you
Do you notice me at all
I can't Focus when I hear you
Do you notice I can't focus

I can't Focus when I'm near you
Do you notice me at all

I've been walking in the dark
I've been walking in the rain
I've been walking with so much pain

I've been walking in the sun
It's bought me so much fun
Lying on a beach
Darkness out of reach
The world is not so cold
But still, it makes me fold

So hold me and keep me sailing
Hold me close to you
Keep me from failing
Disappearing from you

Keep those clouds dispersing
Never leave my side

Don't let that peaceful water
Don't let it subside
Don't let my head confide
Don't let my head confide
Don't let my head

With those cynical lies (confide)

Why can't we see our fortunancy
Living as legends have lived.

Knowing that nothing is left when we die

It's just on the tip of your tongue, and you're so silent
Wanting to live and laugh all the time
Sitting alone with you tea and your crime
Children with kids, and people with parents
Any which way there's no past and no presence
When the day comes and all of them bums
Will reveal enchanting persons

Half of it's misunderstanding love

For Good
(Elphaba) I'm limited- just look at me. I'm limited. And just look at you, you can do all I couldn't do, Glinda. So now it's up to you- for both of us- now it's up to you...

(Glinda) I've heard it said that people come into our lives for a reason, bringing something we must learn. And we are led to those who help us most to grow, if we let them, and we help them in return. Now, I don't know if I believe that's true, but I know I'm who I am today, because I knew you. Like a comet pulled from orbit as it passes a sun, like a stream that meets a boulder halfway through the wood. Who can say if I've been changed for the better? But, because I knew you, I have been changed for good.

(Elphaba) It well may be that we will never meet again in this lifetime, so let me say before we part- so much of me is made of what I learned from you, you'll be with me like a handprint on my heart. And now whatever way our stories end, I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend. Like a ship blown from it's mooring by a wind off the sea, like a seed dropped by a skybird in a distant wood. Who can say if I've been changed for the better? But, because I knew you, (Glinda) because I knew you, (Both) I have been changed for good.

(Elphaba) And just to clear the air, I ask forgiveness for the the things I've done you blame me for. (Glinda) But then I guess we know there's blame to share- (Both) and none of it seems to matter anymore!

(They both sing the following simultaneously) (Glinda) Like a comet pulled from orbit as it passes a sun, like a stream that meets a boulder halfway throught the wood... (Elphaba) Like a ship blown from it's mooring by a wind off the sea, like a seed dropped by a bird in the wood... (Both) Who can say if I've been changed for the better? I do believe I have been changed for the better. (Glinda) And, because I knew you, (Elphaba) because I knew you, (Both) because I knew you- I have been changed... for good."
for no one,the beatles,"Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years"

forsaken,fgfc820,"I heard your name the other day
And it cut me like a blade
I guess that time cannot heal every wound
Some memories never fade

I wish that we could just get back in line
And pick up where we left off
But once you lose your grip on time
You blink, and then it's gone

I thought these tears were gone
Now look what you have done
A moment out of time
When you left me behind

I feel like I could drown
Get lost and never found
I'm drifting out to sea
Why have you forsaken me?

I don't recall all the roads I took
Or the streets that I have roamed
But I'd trade them all for just another look
At the faces I once called home

All the years it took to build these walls
Stone by stone and brick by brick
Could not prepare me for the fall
Or the pain that I'd inflict

fortune,dead can dance,"From ancient times to the present day
There have been those who have claimed her as a lover
So driven by the will to possess
Have pursued her to the very ends of the earth

We enter into it it enters into us
We enter into it it enters into us
As the wheel spins and turns
The fortunate ones are seen to emerge
We enter into it it enters into us

Fortune smiles upon our heads
Mistakenly we cling to her warm embrace
How easily we seem to forgive and forget
I'm lost in the security of our new found wealth

There are those of you amongst us
Bearing vacant faces and empty smiles
Their fates have already been decided upon
They will leave behind them only the victims of their misplaced trust

Fortune smiles upon our heads

It's an action of fractions you're passing along

With this pain in my brain. It feels scattered like doves
Though the sky where my eyes have been drifting towards recently

And it's the closest I can be to egocentricity.
This overwhelming sense of rejection will sneak behind and tear at me
And it'll slam me to the ground into reality
And I'll deal with my disparity.

Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Why don't you love me now?
Why don't you love me now?

As I'm swept around with a million pieces more
Of myself I once learned to lose
Though it never helped me forget the truth

O Francesca
Who's going to save you now
It takes guts to put your hand up
To risk it all and stand up to the
Tongue twisters
Campaign of whispers

Who dragged her name
Through the dirt
Who dragged her name
Through the dirt
Trampled it down
Burned it to the ground
Left her the orphan of the world

Who put that twist in her vows
Who put that twist in her vows
Who took her speech
Bent it out of reach
Put out the light of the world

Who laid her down, took her rose
Who laid her down, took her rose
Who took her flower
Now she charges by the hour
Left her the whore of the world"

I don't know you from Adam, it could make my day
If you leave me a message I'll give it away
'Cause the most perfect strangers that you can talk to
Are the ones who pretend that you're not really you

Are with any attempts here to play Frankenstein
Come with plenty of chances for changing your mind
When you're building your own creation
Nothing's better than real than a real
Imitation

I won't find it fantastic or think it absurd
When the gun in the first act goes off in the third
'Cause it's rare that you ever know what to expect
From a guy made of corpses with bolts in his neck

If the creature is limping the parts are in place
With a mind of its own and a fist for a face
Say hello to your new creation
Now it's better than real
It's a real imitation

You may wonder what the catch is
As we batten down the hatches

And when later we find that the thing we devised
Has the villagers clamouring for it's demise
We will have to admit the futility of
Trying to make something more of this jerry-built love

And you'll notice it bears a resemblance to
Everything I imagined I wanted from you
But at least it's my own creation
And it's better than real
It's a real imitation"

To let it all hang out

So shout if you're a freak like me
Don't apologize

All you have to do is be my Fred Astaire

Get up now... be my Fred Astaire (x2)

freedom,anthony hamilton & elayna boynton,"Felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders
But should I break or retreat and then return
Facing the fear that the truth, I discover
No telling how, all these will work out
But I've come to far to go back now

I am looking for freedom
Looking for freedom
And to find it cost me everything I have
Well I am looking for freedom
Looking for freedom
And to find it, may take everything I have

I know all too well it don't come easy
The chains of the world they seem to moving tight
I try to walk around if I'm stumbling so come here
Tryin to get up but the doubt is so strong
There's gotta be a winning in my bones

I'm looking for freedom,
Looking for freedom
And to find it, cost me everything I have
Well I'm looking for freedom,
I'm looking for freedom
And to find it, may take everything I have

Oh not giving up there's always been hard, so hard
But if I do the thanks lase the way I won't get far

Mhm, life hasn't been very kind to me lately (well)
But I suppose it's a push from moving on (oh yeah)
In time the sun's gonna shine on me nicely (on me yeah)
Sudden tells me 'cause things are coming
And I ain't gonna not believe

I'm looking for freedom,
Looking for freedom
And to find it, cost me everything I have
Well I'm looking for freedom,
I'm looking for freedom
And to find it, may take everything I have"

You should - yourself anyway
Now, you don't have to listen to a word I say
But If know you, you'll be humpin' away

If you can't use that, use a 10-foot pole
Stick it up your ass and go for a stroll
Everyone will know you've been to this show

If you can't take, eat my stool
Masturbate with some crazy glue
I don't care what you do

Undastand, I'm not fuckin' around with you
Try to resist, I'll dismiss you
Fuck you, fuck you
(Fuck you, fuck you)

Basically, I'm the worst nightmare you ever had
Huh, figure but trigger happy nigga with a badge
Parading around Los Angeles
High off coke with a banana clip

Feasting off the weak street evangelists
With a manuscript and a professional ass whippin'
Task force, brass knuckles, a master in ass kickin'
If ya ask for it, I blast for it, your back flippin'

No one saw it, I won't stop the clock's tickin'
Got a rookie for a partner that's ready to fight niggas
The world's a merry-go-round of stereotype niggas
He's a spit in the face for pit bull or bite niggas
Matter-a fact, kinda like this cat for a white nigga

My object is to deprogram, blind your optics
You cannot stop this mission, this topic

'Cuz you could write tickets my nigga or get paid
Learn this game of the streets or get slayed
Collect this cheese at the end of this maze
Or hit the desk and fill out forms for days

Need I remind you how easy it would be
To take the city by storm, with a whole force behind you?
Shottie in the trunk and on my ankle there's a nine too
'Cuz psychologically the guns you use, will define you

Undastand, I'm not fuckin' around with you

In a city where it pays to be bilingual
Cho soy greifo, no me porta bu culro via ah diablo

Or five-o, leavin' enemies dead on arrival
For a couple of mil' and your fuckin' the deal up
Try to play hero cop and you still suck
Put you to bed or runnin' your head, you won't feel much

Get yo' hands up against the wall

full circle,half moon run,"Cap off kneeling at the back of the church,
Feeling water on your brow, if it's healing it hurts
At first a sharpish pain that returns as a thought
That the needle in your skin will bring you closer to god
And I watch as your head turns full circle
Our hope was with a coffee and a medical text
It's too easy knowin' nothing blowing off the rest
And the riddles in the pages leave at too much to guess
And the worry cracks a fracture from your hip to your chest
As I watch as your head turns full circle
We got lost in the travels in the spiritual book
Missed the beaches from nirvana and the way that they look
And the crooks they're on the island they're killin' to keep runnin'
They're running severance on the plastic and it seems to be working
Is that the best that I can do?
As I watch as your head turns full circle
You appear even tempered though your looks will deceive
And the sparks are always flying cause you drink for relief
With the heart of a child and the wit of a fool
It's a wonder why I don't try to build a wall around you
When I watch as your head turns full circle
And I watch as your head turns full circle
Yeah I watch as your head turns full circle"
full of fire,shalamar,"You came into my life
When I was lost and all alone

To make me forget past mistakes
If I had known that you'd be coming my way
You would have spared me so much heartache

Girl, I'm glad you realize
That from now until the end of time
I'm gonna claim you to be mine

I get to play at being irresponsible,

I never forget you in my prayers,
I never have a bad thing to report.

You're my picture on the wall,
You're my vision in the hall,
You're the one I'm talking to,
When I get in from my work,
You are my guy, and you don't even know it,
I am living out the life of a poet,
I am the jester in the ancient court,
And you're the funny little frog in my doorway.

My eye sight's fading, my hearing's dim,
I can't get insured for the state I'm in,
I'm a danger to myself I've been starting fights,
At the party at the club on a Saturday night,
But I don't get disapproving from my boy,
He gets all the highlights wrapped in joy.

You're my picture on the wall,
You're my vision in the hall,
You're the one I'm talking to,
When I get in from my work,
You are my guy, and you don't even know it,
I am living out the life of a poet,
I am the jester in the ancient court,
And you're the funny little frog in my throat.

I had a conversation with you at night,
It's a little one sided but that's all right,
I tell you in the kitchen about my day,
You sit on the bed in the dark changing places,
With the ghost that was there before you came,
You've come to save my life again.

I don't dare to touch your hand,
I don't dare to think of you,
In a physical way,
And I don't know how you smell,
You are the cover of my magazine,
You're my fashion tip, a living museum,
I'd pay to visit you on rainy Sundays,
And maybe tell you all about it, someday."

Cracks healing up
The future soul forgives this mess
You waste twenty years
And wind up alone demented

Aah, aaaah, aaaah
Te dañé

Me olvidé de ti, de tu divina luz
Me olvidé de ti, Gaia ""planeta azul""
Sé que te fallé
Sé que te fallé

Ya no hay progreso en mi soberbia
Manché el aire y mi conciencia
Me creí más que Dios por mi inteligencia
Son tantas falsas vanidades
Me olvidé de lo importante
Y es que nunca fui dueña de tu herencia

Aah, aaaah, aaaah
Te fallé
Aah, aaaah, aaaah
Te dañé

Me olvidé de ti, de tu divina luz
Me olvidé de ti, Gaia ""planeta azul""

No, no es el fin
Por favor, ten fuerza
Quiero vivir y no pagar condena

Aah, aaaah, aaaah
Te dañé

Me olvidé de ti, de tu divina luz
Me olvidé de ti, Gaia ""planeta azul""
Sé que te fallé
Sé que te fallé"
galapogos,the smashing pumpkins,"Ain't it funny how we pretend we're still a child?
Softly stolen under blanket skies

And rescue me from me
And all that I believe

I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace
Here with you
Will you leave me too?

Carve out your heart for keeps in an old oak tree
And hold me for goodbyes and whispered lullabies

And tell me I am still the man I'm supposed to be

I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace
Here with you
Will you leave me too?
Will you leave me too?

Too late to turn back now
I'm running out of sound
And I am changing, changing
And if we died right now
This fool you love somehow, is here with you

I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace
Here with you
Would you leave me too?
Would you leave me too?"
games,hüsker dü,"I could stay here the rest of my life
I could be happy, never be lonely
I don't need to go looking for misery

I could surround myself with my props
Playing my part, getting caught up in a game
Some game that anyone can play
It's a game, some game that anyone can play

I could be proud of things I have done
Pretend I don't have to try to be someone
I could say that I've done it all before

I could get wiser, I could get jaded
I could remember, I could just fade away
In a game that anyone can play
It's a game, some game that anyone can play

I am so proud, I don't have to try
Never a need to justify it
When people say, ""Hey, I was important too""

Memories go to reinforce
The things I have done for better or worse
It's a game that anyone can play
It's a game, some game that anyone can play

Just when you think that all your answers are so right
You'll fade away and disappear from sight
The ones who said you're great will find another way

I could be sad, I could be lonely
I could still have such friends if I had only
Didn't play the games I had to play

I was important when I was cool
Now it gets lonely playing the fool
It's a game that anyone can play
It's a game, some game that anyone can play

It's a game, some game that anyone can play
It's a game, some game that anyone can play
It's a game, some game, some game
It's a game, some game, some game

It's a game, some game, some game
It's a game, some game, some game
It's a game, some game, some game
It's a game, some game, some game"
garbage man,g. love & special sauce,"I'm your garbage man
Coming down the street
Kick your can, kick your can
Better get your butt down on the curb
And say hey to me
I'm by the liquor store
Giving you the eye
When you walk by
I'm on the subway line
I'm in the coffee shop
Eating toast and eggs
Chorus:
I never beg baby
I never get down on my knees
I'm gonna get you just the same
Girl you had me gone long gone
Lost in your eyes
Cost in my pride
Now I got you calling me speaking me seeking me sexing me
What happened to my freedom
You need me like the air
You drink me like the water
Sort of funny I'm your daddy
You ain't my daughter
First you said you needed sapce
Then please leave my place
Every other day or so
Just get from my face
A taste of wet I got and got
I'll bet that woman tried to play me
The girl had much game I can't get with that
She paid her price to play
But Imma freak one moves
With a sure aim
I'll get you just the same
Chorus
I'm gonna get you undressed
Your mind ain't gonna rest
I'm the best I'm the best
Forget about that man I'm your one
Son of none
Imma move you Imma bruise you
Gonna make you love me
Then Imma lose you

You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You'll be mine"
garden of love,aqualung,"In the garden of love I saw
A moment of sun in her eye
And everything was quiet

In the garden of love I saw
Starlight sigh and shadow move

Faltering, no faltering
Faltering

Before you go, a few words for your heart
Before you turn, something to ponder in your heart
As you go

In our garden of love we grew
Roses so red our hearts were busted open
All feeding on the dream we made
The bright and beautiful parade
That bloom by bloom began to fade
And blow by blow, oh

Before you go, a few words for your heart
Before you turn, something to ponder in your heart
As you go

How we tried to make everything right
How we fought and we talked through the night
How we nearly
Made it

In the garden of love I saw
A moment of sun in her eye
And everything was quiet

Stepping out into the light
Other side of the window
Blinking and blind in the light
Other side of the window
Falter, no faltering now
Other side of the window
Falter, no faltering now
That journey is over
Over
Over

There's only so much that our heart can grow
Then everything else starts to overflow
And you're young and in love
Back then there was no way of knowing

So we pushed and we pulled with our nerves of steel
You had the pedals and I had the wheel
And the terrible misillusions
We never knew where we were going

There's only so much that our heart can grow
Then everything else starts to overflow
But you're young and in love
Back then there was no way of knowing"
gasoline,alpine,"There's gasoline in your heart
There's fire in mine
I know I'm never gunna light you
But there's always night time

There's a light I've found in your eyes,
That I've never found in mine
I know I, I could never ever show you
But there's always night time - (Knowing no-one to someone)

I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time

There's gasoline in your heart
I could have your fire
I know that this is momentary

Imagine it's night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time

Can you feel?
Can you feel?

I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time"
gates of eden,bryan ferry,"Of war and peace, the truth just twists
It's curfew gull, it glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun
Though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the gates of Eden
With a time-rusted compass blade
Alladin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the golden calf
On their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the gates of Eden
Relationships of a ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned accordingly
To wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden
The motorcycle black Madonna
A two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden
At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden"
gemini,wild nothing,"You're the mouth, I've got nothing to say anymore
It's a shame I know, we're perfectly in loathe
Let's not say, you never give me anything
I don't care, despite of what's right there

And do I really need to tell you
That I've got a twisted twin soul for you?
I've got my palm out reaching for you

You're the eyes, I've got nothing to see anymore
To convince me enough to compromise my heart
Let's not say, it's just a game again
We both know we're perfectly in loathe

And do I really need to tell you
That I've got a twisted twin soul for you?
I've got my palm out reaching for you"

Back to the foundation, takin' you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginnin' and a brand new hunger
Starvin' to where my skin was suffocatin' my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decoratin' my crib

Touch the love, I got like you holdin' my heart in my hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes, it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit

Strictly raw shit is what niggas be seekin' me for
Testin' my strength, that's what the Devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step, for sure
Rep and make you wanna accept more

Niggas analyze the jewel that, I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like somethin' that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doin' it, these mo'fuckers probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feelin' of people like the comin' of Jesus
While a lot of other niggas don't be tellin' you nothin'
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin' my buttons

Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearin' smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggas like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes, I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, 'cause you got your whole life ahead of you son
A whole new thing startin' for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin' for me

When I spit you know, I always love to garnish it hard
While you love it, hate it niggas tryin' to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggas from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggas to my live niggas everywhere
Too late for turnin' back, we takin' it there

gentlemen,teddy geiger,"I was blinded by the lights I saw reflecting in their eyes
It blinded me from the sea of everybody's smiles

Well I have done all that I can
And I have done all that I'll stand for
Carry on young gentlemen
I have done all that I can
I have done all that I'll stand for

We left after dark, the sun had fallen for the moon
And all the moments raced, its going way too fast its way too soon
So I sat alone before a moment they came back
Now I'm stuck right here reeling in the slack now
From my previous nights

So carry on young gentlemen
Well I have done all that I can
And I have done all that I'll stand for
Carry on young gentlemen
I have done all that I can
I have done all that I'll stand for

Deliver me now from everything we should not do
It's so unpredictable, but still you know just what you're gonna do
And even the moments that fall flat
Something is different, even though its hard to mean that
I wasn't listening

So carry on young gentlemen
Well I have done all that I can
And I have done all that I'll stand for
Carry on young gentlemen
I have done all that I can
I have done all that I'll stand for

I'll stand for something, I'll stand for something
I will stand for something, yeah

ghost song,air,"Awake
Shake dreams from your hair
My pretty child, my sweet one
Choose the day and choose the sing of your day
The day's divinity
Firt thing you see

A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by it's quiet side
And we laugh like soft, mad children
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy
The music and voices are all around us

Choose they croon the ancient ones
The timehas come again
Choose now, they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake

Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream
Come with us
Everything is broken up and dances

Indians scattered
On dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's
Fragile eggshell mind

We have assembled inside
This ancient and insane theater
To propagate our lust for life
And flee the swarming wisdom of the streets

The barns have stormed
The windows kept
And only one of all the rest
To dance and save us
From the divine mockery of words
Music inflames temperament

Ohh great creator of being
Grant us one more hour
To perform our art
And perfect our lives

We need great golden copulations

When the true kings murderers
Are allowed to roam free
A thousand magicians arise in the land

Where are the feast we are promised"

ghosting,freelance whales,"Do you ever play with kids in the basement
Soot upon your face so you were a hot mess
All your little molars cracked in the pressure
Come here little sister, let's get you to bed

But oh you caught me sleeping in the power sockets
You caught me mildew in the tiles of the bathroom
And oh you shot a glance like I was doing okay
Oh I am never on my way

Do you ever run with him in the morning
And think about jumping over the back fence
Seven different places need a bit of mending
All we use our eyes to fill in most the gaps

But oh you caught me sleeping in the power sockets
You caught me mildew in the tiles of the bathroom
And oh you shot a glance like I was doing okay
Oh I am never on my way

The reason my molars are so broken
Is I spend too much time ghosting
With the likes of you and yours

The reason my insides are so swollen
Is I spend too much time ghosting
With the likes of you and yours"

They're only shadows cast, past this place
Where voices carry at the speed of sound
If I should cry before they lay me down

Sorry for the words, words I left unsaid
Sorry being one of the words I did forget
All the time we spent, wasted in the end
Every precious moment taken for granted
There in the corner of my mind
Lies the weight of my regret
Between the shadow and the light
Ghost you're in my head

Shelter from the storm when I sleep
There's comfort in the morn, a siren sings
If only for a moment, I can breathe
The thought of you comes crashing through on me

Sorry for the words, words I left unsaid
Sorry being one of the words I did forget
All the time we spent, wasted in the end
Every precious moment taken for granted
There in the corner of my mind
Lies the weight of my regret
Between the shadow and the light
Ghost you're in my head
Ghost you're in my head

Tell me there's no need to be afraid
They're only shadows cast past has played
Where voices carry at the speed of sound
If I should die before I lay me down

I'm sorry for the way, the way I treated you
A little bit too late, but if you only knew
I'd take away the pain, pain I put you through
I'd do it all again walking in your shoes

There in the corner of my mind
Lies the weight of my regret
Between the shadow and the light

girl from the north country,joe cocker,"If you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was the true love of mine.

If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she's a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds.

Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see from me if her hair hangs long
That's the way I remember her best.

I'm a-wonderin' if she remember me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day.

So if you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine."

He said he would not give her play

I asked him, ""Please?"" he said, ""You may""
Her pants were tight and that's okay
If she would dance, I would DJ
We took a walk down to the bay

I hope she'll say
""Hey, me and you should hit the hay!""
I asked her out, she said, ""No way!""
I should have probably guessed her gay

You have so many friends cheering you along
Don't turn a deaf ear to their song

As your world is turning you're holding on
Give it away, give it away
Holding onto right and wrong won't serve you

We keep on fighting to maintain our father's place
This time line never finds an end in revenge
Here comes an open heart to blow it all away

As your world is turning you're holding on
Give it away, give it away
Holding onto right and wrong won't serve you

As your world is turning you're holding on
Give it away, give it away
Holding onto right and wrong won't serve you

As your world is turning you're holding on
Give it away, give it away
Holding onto right and wrong won't serve you

As your world is turning you're holding on
Just give it away, give it away
Holding onto right and wrong won't serve you

Won't serve you"

We missed you on the charts last week
Damn that's right, you wasn't there
If sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shit it it?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club go on and walk the other way

After my blood turns into alcohol,
No, I just wanna hold ya.

I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all"
give up,half moon run,"I just wanted
To resolve it
To make peace with
All those weekends

We all just give up
We all stand down
With no lesson learned
With our eyes half shut

No confusion
It's been obvious
Hallelujah!
I've been saved by no one again, and again

But we all just give up
We all stand down
With no lesson learned
With our eyes half shut"

glass,bat for lashes,"I will rise now
And go about the city
In the street's
Broadways I seek
Him whom my soul loveth

Went over the sea
What did I find?
A thousand crystal towers
A hundred emerald cities

And the hand of the watchman
In the night sky
Points to my beloved
A knight in crystal armour

And I tried to hold him
I tried for the creed
I'll make a suit of colours
To stop the blinding mirrors

Saw a cape of red and gold
Stifle up the being
With the perfect armour
With a perfect dream

To be made of glass
When two suns are shining
The battle becomes blinding
To be made of glass
But we ride tonight, tonight, tonight, we ride

And with two suns spinning
At two different speeds
Was born a hot white diamond
Burning through the rainbow

Flames fell into orbit
To hold eternally
Two heavenly spirits
That just wouldn't seem

To be made of glass
When two suns are shining
The battle becomes blinding
To be made of glass
But we ride tonight, tonight, tonight, we ride

Hey, oh
Hey, oh oh oh
Hey, oh
Hey, oh oh oh
Hey, oh
Hey oh oh oh"

There's a shadow beside her
Up and down through the blues
Up and down through the blues
Clouds give me my silent cues

And I'm up in my glider
Down up in my glider

With a shadow beside her
It begins to rain on her window pane

And I'm up in my glider
Up in my glider

There's no shadow beside her
Then it's a thundering and lightning
Yeah boys, it's gettin' pretty frightenin'
I feel like an outsider
Then the sun shows through in and right on cue
There's a shadow beside her

Up and down through the blues
Up and down through the blues
Up in my glider
Up in my glider
Up in my glider

And I'm telling you boys there ain't no noise
Ain't no noise
Ain't no noise
Me and my baby ain't never gonna bring my glider down
Me and my baby ain't never gonna bring my glider down"
glorious,everclear,"You were shining in a white light
Like a fairy-tale movie star
Never really thought I would find Snow White
Drinking in a downtown bar

You were underneath the white light
Like a vision in a deep dark place
Never really thought I would fall for a country girl
With an angel's face

Everything fades away
The world changes every day
When I think about you
It makes me want to say

Glorious
Glorious
You are glorious

We were walking in the white sun
We were growing up and throwing down loud
There was silver in our eyes and we didn't know why
The power of the north so proud

We were lost inside a long dark summer
We were running down a nowhere road
Looking for a light in the middle of the night
A place that felt like home

I know everything fades away
The world changes everyday
When I think about you, and what we had
It makes me want to say

Glorious
You are to me (Glorious)
Yes, you are to me (Glorious)

I know this glorious life
Has never been what it seems
I was asleep when I was living the dream
Living the dream
I know I was living the dream

I think about the time in the city
We were running away trying to feel free
I could never believe
That you wanted to be with me

We'd wait in the cold for the last bus home
Sleeping with your arms around me
The truth is never what it seemed to be
I was living the life
When I should have been living the dream (Glorious)

Should've been living the dream (Glorious)
I know I should've been living the dream (Glorious)

I know I never understood how much you would mean to me
Now I know I was living the dream (Glorious)
I know I was living the dream (Glorious)
I know I know I was living the dream (Glorious)

I know this glorious life has never been what it seems to be
I was walking through life asleep when I was living the dream"
glory,essie jain,"How I will rise up from the waters where I've drowned
You will know me
You will see
Your face will light up from the glory that it's found
I am listening
You are hearing me
Don't go
Make your mind up
I've been down far as can be
Up until then my voice, it was caught up
Up until then, I never could see
You'll find out I am nothing I might seem
It's not opened so easily
Don't go
Make your mind up
I've been down far as can be
Up until then my voice, it was caught up
Up until then, I never could see
Don't go
Make your mind up
I've been down far as can be
Up until then my voice, it was caught up
Up until then, I never could see"
glow,blackfield,"I show the scars
Of every fear and doubt
I hurt myself
To let the darkness out
Out...

The days go by
And nothing brings me joy
The glow was strong
When I was a boy
But it's gone

And the glow
It goes
So slow
It goes

Cracks appear
And passion slips away
Colors fade
And turn to shades of grey
Fade away

And the glow...

If you knew the man I used to be
Please hold me under the sea
Or scratch my arms till they bleed
Save me
Will you help me to feel the glow?"

go away,archer prewitt,"I must admit I wonder
When she brought up all of those things on her mind.
I couldn't do much better
When I told her everything was fine.

I had to go away.
I had to go away.

I might have waited longer
Seemed like forty days and eighty nights,
But Then I saw my angel.
It seemed like everything would turn out right.

Set my heart aflame.
She became my everything.
See the joy she brings.

If we can get through this
You know we got our wish.
We took it to the level,
And we held out for more.

And isn't it a trist,
The things we might have missed;
Of stickin' with the wrong too long to know what right was.

And isn't it a shame?
We have only ourselves to blame.
At least thats what they tell you when you take the back door.

But it just never fit;
The thought of makin' it end.
Lets leave it to the pretty boys and girls in the show.

Why do we go away?
Why do we go away?
Why do we go away?"

Go now

Know all you need you have alone
Leave guided by the storm

Why don't you let me do my thing for you, I'm coming to...

And I don't care

goblin,adam green,"When she stopped talking to me
I knew that she would create a problem
And after 5 seconds flash
She came at me just like a goblin
Once passed and things calmed down
So me and her went on a play-date
I said ""your walking cliche""
But she said ""'it's just you and me babe""
Ok

So its just us walking through town
And we go in the liquor store
Buying 2 beers, spying the cat in the window of the bar next door

Then she was cursing at me
And pointing to the whitches couldron
Grabbed me, she got in my face
And then she punched me, just like a goblin"

godless,aeon,"You speak of armageddon and hell
Those who follows you, they will all be blessed

Holy bible was written by man
Not by divine or superior hand
Once you see this you might see that you're fooled
It's all about control of mankind

I am godless i salute my desires and i
Take responsibilities for all my actions
Won't need a fake god to hide my fear of the unknown
Don't try to look down on me because i can see through you

Soon you will see
Theres no god you will see you're fooled
Just as the ones you fooled too
There is no such thing as christ
He was crowned hanged to a cross
And he bleed as he was pierced in
His side on the cross of calvary

You're telling lies and you're fooling the week ones
And you're feeding on their loss and their death is your profit
As they're starving to death
You are preaching, spreading lies how to live

You will suffer no god shall save you
I will show you no mercy for this
If you'll pray then you will see who is right
Jehova is nothing but hoax

I am godless i salute my desires and i
Take responsibilities for all my actions
Won't need a fake god to hide my fear of the unknown

Well, then maybe it's alright
I'm goin' home

But it's inside, go ahead, fight it

Where bluebirds fly
Somewhere over the rainbow
Why oh why
Hear me now!
Style funky, you know that's me
Killer bee whohoho one man army
Down for mine when I go on tour
Throw your hands in the air if you want more
Style is evil is like an wicked witch
With the mi-ca-phone, funky as a bitch
Which is which, makes me nasty nasty

More than just a heartbeat
From the city floor
More than just the bright lights
That led me to your distant shore

I'm keepin' my head up
And out of the sand
Way 'cross the rooftops
I'm gonna plan our escape

No, we're not ready
To see her fall, to see her fall
To see her fall in love
I know you are getting older
We should never turn our shoulder
I have never seen you suffer
I will never hurt you, mother
I know you are getting older
We should never turn our shoulder
I have never seen you suffer
I will never hurt you, mother
I know you are getting older
We should never turn our shoulder
Oh, I will never make you suffer
I will never hurt you, mother"
going to georgia,atom and his package,"The most remarkable thing about coming home to you
Is the feeling of being in motion again,
It's the most extraordinary thing in the world.
I have two big hands
And a heart pumping blood
And a 1967 Colt .45
With a busted safety catch.
The world shines
As I cross the Macon county line,
Going to Georgia.
The most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you
And that you are standing in the doorway
And you smile as you ease the gun from my hand
I am frozen with joy right where I stand.
The world glows its' slide underneath your hair.
40 miles from Atlanta, this is nowhere.
Going to Georgia, hahahaaa haaaa.
The world shines
As I cross the Macon county line,
Going to Georgia, hahahaaa haaaa."

There's no place to hurt, so start the fight, I'm gonna get it
Tallest running for me, baby, you're gonna regret it
I can't understand why you can't free yourself and let it
Go, go, go, go

Got you in my palm, now listen good, you can't escape it
Bring you to my world and hold you see if you can take it

Flying through the night we going up, better hold tight it
Go, go, go, go

Let me see you jump up, come on, with me, let's go higher
Climbin' up the speakers we gon' set this place on fire

Cut your teeth, cut your mouth, cut it out
Meteor rise from obscurity

golden heart,mark knopfler,"She was swinging by the Bangles in a main street store
A while before we met
The most dangerous angles that you ever saw
She spied her amulet
And she took a loop of leather from around her neck
And that was then the start
The most dangerous lady on her quarter deck
She found her golden heart
You found your golden heart

Then we swirled around each other and the thread was spun
To some Arcadian band
I would stop it from swinging like a pendulum
Just to hold time in my hand
And you shot me with a cannonball of history
And long forgotten art
I'd be turning it over as our words ran free
I'd hold your golden heart
I'd hold your golden heart

Nothing in the world prepared me for your heart, your heart
Nothing in the world that I love more, your heart, your heart
Your golden heart

Your golden heart
Your golden heart
Your golden heart
Your golden heart, golden heart

And every time I'm thinking of you from a distant shore
And all the time I sleep
I will have a reminder that my baby wore
A part of you to keep
And I'll send you all my promises across the sea
And while we are apart
I will carry the wonder that you gave to me
I'll wear your golden heart
I'll wear your golden heart

Nothing in the world prepared me for your heart, your heart
Nothing in the world that I love more, your heart, your heart
Your golden heart

Your golden heart
Your golden heart
Your golden heart
Your golden heart, golden heart

Golden heart
Your golden heart

gone for good,the shins,"Untie me, I've said no vows
The train is getting way too loud
I've gotta leave here, my girl, get on with my lonely life
Just leave the ring on the rail for the wheels to nullify

Until this turned in my head
I let you stay and you paid no rent
I spent twelve long months on the lam
That's enough sitting on the fence for the fear of breaking dams

I'd find a fatal flaw in the logic of love and go out of my head
You love a sinking stone that'll never elope, so get used to the lonesome
Girl, you must atone some
Don't leave me no phone number there

It took me all of a year to put the poison pill to your ear
But now I stand on honest ground, on honest ground
You want to fight for this love, but honey, you cannot wrestle a dove
So baby, it's clear

You want to jump and dance, but you sat on your hands
And lost your only chance
Go back to your hometown, get your feet on the ground
And stop floating around

I found a fatal flaw in the logic of love and went out of my head
You love a sinking stone that'll never elope, so get used to the lonesome
Girl, you must atone some
Don't leave me no phone number there"

Seems so long ago you walked away
And left me alone

Y yo recuerdo what you said to me
You were acting so strange
Quizas fui ciego y no quise entender

Was it something I said
To make you turn away
To make you walk out and leave me cold

If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here

한번도 못했던 말 울면서 할 줄은 나 몰랐던 말
나는요 오빠가 좋은 걸 어떡해

입고 나왔던 옷이 실수였던 건지
아직 모르는 척 기억 안 나는 척
아무 일없던 것처럼 굴어볼까
그냥 나가자고 얘기할까

이런 나를 보고 그런 슬픈 말은 하지 말아요 (하지 말아요)
철없는 건지 조금 둔한 건지 믿을 수가 없는걸요

good feeling,reef,"Got this good feeling in me.
Now that everything's feeling clear inside.
Look around, that glow is real.
Silence felt so good,
Inside it lay so calm
Wind that blew some cold;
Now it feels a world away.
Not to try and just to be,
Someone truly special like you always were.

And when your time comes to work things out,
Your time will come to work things out when it flows

A passion came to me,
Warmth around, just like you found someone.
Alongside it walked with me,
Showed me to be grateful, for the way I am.
Came from deep inside.
Thoughts so real, just as the ground you're on.
Why do you want to try to be?
Look to yourself I think you'll find someone.

And when your time comes to work things out,
Your time will come to work things out when it flows.

It feels so close to me."
good for you,griffin house,"Leave. Leave me alone again
It's nothing that I'm not used to
I need, need you at home again
I'm trying to understand you
Don't try to know me by the things I done
Words never come out true

If you could see me then you could believe
That I was good for you
And if your love could free me from the things I do
I could be good for you

Heavy sometimes in the back of my mind
For a reason that I know I'd find if I could
But I'm no good
I've lost everyone close to me
I was planning on changing someday
My son, it's been awhile since you heard from me
When I was standing on the top of the world and
I'm gonna get it back if I can
Don't try to know me by the things they say
Words never come out true

If you could see me then you could believe
That I was good for you
And if your love could free me from the things I do
I could be good for you

Heavy sometimes in the back of my mind
For a reason that I know I'd find if I could
But I'm no good
I shut you out of my life but you're never gone
There will always be a voice telling me this ain't wrong
This ain't wrong!
You're everything I want
Everything I need
I could be could be good for you"

Here's to our achings and here's to your having...
A good life, from me

Soflty now, you owe it to yourself
And dont think that you will be left on the shelf
Cuz, there's someone for you and there's someone for me

Here's to your children and here's to your having...

Loudly now, you've lost all your pain
You're married with children and happy again

Forget that I rang you and promise you'll have such a
Beautifully happy and
Painlessly romantic...

If it's true (true), that money is time, then watch this
Ain't tryin' to run out of time, so I purchase some watches
Y'all sick, the chips got the haters nauseous
They chicks jumpin' in my whip like a mosh pit

'Cause I just get effected by the bank
It's great (great) to never know the feel of bein' fake

Hold up (hold up)
Success is a woman, I always had dreams of sexin'
If wantin' her is a crime, just take me in for possession
Even in a recession, I'm leavin' a good impression
Reflection on the rims, so they can see they expressions
I'm busy man, you need to schedule an appointment
Haters on they job and they act like they enjoy it
Wake up in the morning, now hop into my foreign
Walk into the bank and it's just like a house warming
Hey, we get the money by the minute
They said we couldn't do it (do it) but we already did it (did it)
I'm fresh outfitted and my Benz got kitted
Cause I get get did it and you did did didn't
I admit it, I'm really 'bout to show you how I do
If you know that you a hater, this dedicated to you
You hatin my last move, I'm way on my next move
See they 'hate to see you be successful
[Chorus]
Ha ha ha ha haters, good morning
Ha ha ha ha haters, good morning"
good news,brad,"Gather around and
Choose the fare
All these weapons are free
Carrying armor
'Til I can't feel my hands

Gather round sister
And change for us all
'Cause I'm no better
Then I'll lay my hands on the ground

And out of this urge I
Crumble down
Rollin' the girls for you
And I don't know nothin'
When I don't understand

Gather round sister
A change for us all
'Cause I'm no better
Then I'll lay my hands on the ground
CHORUS: It's never been news to me

Gather up and rise around
There's a circus in town
I'll tell you it ain't free
Freakshow orders and
I don't understand

Gather round sisters
And lay down your arms
'Cause I wanna show
There's a reason for getting me mine"

good year for the roses,elvis costello,"I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lyin' cold the way you left 'em
But at least your lips caressed them
While you packed

Or the lip-print on a half-filled cup of coffee
That you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
That's so much more than I can say for me

What a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny, I don't even care

As you turn to walk away
As the door behind you closes
The only thing I have to say
It's been a good year for the roses

After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin'
There's so little left to say we haven't said

While a million thoughts go racin' through my mind
I find I haven't said a word
From the bedroom the familiar sound
Of a baby's cryin' goes unheard

What a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny, I don't even care

As you turn to walk away
As the door behind you closes
The only thing I have to say
It's been a good year for the roses"
goodbye cruel world,shakespear's sister,"She likes to wake up and just fake it
She knows if she touches it she'll break it
She can see all the houselights fading
And the ground beneath her feet is shaking
She's singing bye bye my old friend
You're never going to see my face again
You left me outside in the rain
So goodbye mr. a.

Just when you think she's wearing thin
She's walking out with the biggest man you've ever seen
You're never gonna see my face again
It took some time so here I am,
So bye bye mr. a.
Well now her grass is looking greener
And you hope that sometime you might see her
What a diamond, boy, looks like you missed it
It must have left you feeling sick and twisted
Bye bye my old friend
You're never gonna see my face again
You left me outside in the rain
So bye bye I said bye bye"
goodbye forever,my brightest diamond,"Oh, to love
By fire, by flame
This old feeling
Insignificance
Insignificance

Then I can hear you
Brighter than the stars
Your voice is a razor blade

I can see you shining through the sun
You're so mysterious

Lose the hold
As I throw this
With a goodbye forever
Fear of exposure
Fear of exposure

Then I can hear you
Brighter than the stars
Your touch is lightening

I can feel you
Prickling like a thousand shark teeth
Prickling like a thousand shark teeth
Closer to me

Come closer to me
Come closer to me
Come closer to me
Come closer to me
Still"
goodbye my lover,james blunt,"Did I disappoint you?
Or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty?
Or let the judges frown?
Because I saw the end before we'd begun
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
So I took what's mine by eternal right

Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care

You touched my heart you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind and that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you
I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

I am a dreamer but when I wake
You can't break my spirit
It's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bear my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

It goes boom boody-boom boody-boom boody-boom
Boody-boom boody-boom boody-boom-boom-boom,
Him: Oh!
Her: Boom boody-boom boody-boom boody-boom
Him: Well, goodness gracious me.

Him: How often does this happen?
When did the trouble start?
You see, my stethoscope is bobbing
To the throbbing of your heart.
Her: What kind of man is he
To create this allergy?
It goes boom boody-boom boody-boom boody-boom

And I've never yet been beaten or outboxed,

Of my needle in the Punjab
How I cleared up beriberi
And the dreaded dysentery,
But your complaint has got me really foxed.

Rules out measles and thrombosis,
Sleeping sickness and, as far as I can tell,
Influenza, inflammation,
Whooping cough and night starvation,
And you'll be so glad to hear
That both your eyeballs are so clear
That I can positively swear that you are well,

Is right in front of me.

When you're gone

There's a blade by the bed
And a phone in my hand
A dog on the floor
And some cash on the nightstand

And I just can't stand

What if the lights go out and maybe
And then the wind just starts to moan
Outside the door he followed me home

Now goodnight moon

If it's not here soon
I might be done
No it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon

There's a shark in the pool
And a witch in the tree
A crazy old neighbour and he's been watching me
And there's footsteps loud and strong coming down the hall
Something's under the bed
Now it's out in the hedge
There's a big black crow sitting on my window ledge
And I hear something scratching through the wall

Oh what should I do I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
I just hate to be all alone
Outside the door he followed me home

Now goodnight moon
I want the sun
If it's not here soon

While you're up so high
How can you save me
When the dark comes here
Tonight to take me up
To my front walk
And into bed where it kisses my face
And eats my head

What should I do I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
And then the wind just starts to moan
Outside the door he followed me home
Now goodnight moon

Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?

What if daddy was right?
And I knew all the answers?
They could give me the world
But that wouldn't matter

If the gates opened wide,
And made you an angel
Through tears in my eyes
I'd save your seat at the table

Stay with me, don't disappear
To tell the truth, I need you here
I'm afraid, can barely breathe
I need your words, to comfort me
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?

To tell the truth, I need you here

Don't try to run, try to run, they're coming.

got it,sebadoh,"I don't quite get it, but I know you've got it
I don't care if nothing else goes my way all day
I'm taking your morning warmth with me out into the day
And I don't care if nothing else goes my way all day
I think I can stay here a while with you
You make me feel much better
Scared indeed to be without
Storm renders compass useless
Unwanted to be here
I feel the end of something
Everything before us is hopeless
Everything before
I don't quite get it, but I know you've got it
I don't care if nothing else goes my way all day
I'm taking your morning warmth with me out into the day
I don't care if nothing else goes my way all day"
got to get you into my life,the beatles,"I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life!

What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I am true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, and I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

Got to get you into my life!

Got to get you into my life!

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day?"

On the dot at nine

And I've seen blue
But fine lines I don't see
And just because I am in misery
Don't it mean a thing

September, as far as she remembers
They don't teach humility
And just because her only signal is mayday
Don't it mean a thing
That she's seen love
And she's seen war
But fairness she don't see
And just because she is in misery
Don't it mean a thing

That she wants to know

Doing what I'm told
And everybody knows
This is getting out of hand

Everybody is dying for
The chance to be heard, not ignored
And everybody knows
This is getting out of hand

graham greene,john cale,"You're having tea with Graham Greene
In a coloured costume of your choice
And you'll be held in high esteem
If you're seen in between
Stiffly holding umbrellas
Catching the fellows making the toast
To the civil servant Carruthers
Making the others worser than most

You're making small talk now with the Queen
And the elegant ladies in waiting
You're very nervous they can all tell
Pretty well they can tell
So save yourselves for the hounds of hell
They can have you all to themselves
Since the fashion now is to give away
All the things you love so well

Welcome back to Chipping and Sodbury
You can have another chance
It must all seem like second nature
Chopping down the people where they stand
According to the latest score
Mr. Enoch Powell is falling star
So in future please bear in mind
Don't see clear don't see far
When the average social director
Mistook a passenger for the conductor
So shocking see the old Church of E
Looking down on you and me"

Thank you
For the use of the clean towel
Thank you for half of your bed

And your sisters do
But please don't

What does my body have to do
With my gratitude?

Look at you
Little white lying
For the purpose of justifying
What you're trying to do
I know that you feel my resistance
I know that you heard what i said
Otherwise you wouldn't need the excuse

Thank you
For letting me stay here
Thank you for taking me in
I don't know where else
I would have gone
But i don't come and go
Like a pop song
That you can play incessantly
And then forget when it's gone
You can't write me off
And you don't turn me on

So don't change the rules
In an hour or two
I don't know what you and your
Sisters do
But please don't
Please stop
This is not my obligation
What does my body have to do

graveyard,chad vangaalen,"I laid you down
In a wooden box with lonesome thoughts
Down in the graveyard

You came round
Inside the pitch black of your coffin in the ground

You let your ghost
Leak through the earth above your grave
And coast around

To find your love
That you left behind
Inside of this old town

Who are you
Who are you

So come on down
Come and walk around and through the graveyard

Come on by
Come and slip and slide right through the ground

You'll be close
Back to your coffin in the ground
Out by the sound
Of your lover
Who's been buried right beside you in the ground

Who are you
Who are you"

Broken and weary
Unable to find my way

Dizzy and clearly unable to
Just let this go
I am surrendering to the gravity and the unknown
Catch me, heal me, lift me back up to the sun
I choose to live
I fell again
Like a baby unable to stand on my own
Tail in hand
Dizzy and clearly unable to just let this go
High and surrendering to the gravity and the unknown
Catch me, heal me, lift me back up to the sun
I choose to live, I choose to live, I choose to live
Catch me, heal me, lift me back up to the sun
Help me survive the bottom
Calm these hands before they
Snare another pill and
Drive another nail down another needy hole
Please release me
I am surrendering to the gravity and the unknown
Catch me, heal me, lift me back up to the sun
I choose to live,
I choose to live"

Raised up on the wicked things we've said
A great divide between us now
Something we should know
There's something to remember
And something to forget
As long as we remember
There's something to regret
Something we should know
There's a mountain higher than we knew
It's high but such a bitter view
A great divide between us now
Something we should know
A great divide between us now
On different sides of a great divide"

Aren't you in chains

Let the water creep over your face

Just to watch you perform the great escape

How long can you hold your breath?
While you hold mine again and wait
Just to watch you perform the great escape

I'll pull your arms tight behind you back
Use myself as weight
And wonder while you fade

How long can you hold your breath?
While you hold mine again and wait
Just to watch you perform the great escape."

Upon which I float
And I came here to talk

You're the one that I wanted to find

To deny you must be out of their minds

Hiding body parts
A broken dog, a broken leg

And know what I have done

And I won't be forgiven

Guilty on the run
And I know what I have done
Guilty on the run
And I'm never forgiven

I was just a kid
That you could not forgive
Because it's harder

I was just a kid
And all I really wanted
Was my father

I killed a dog so smart and rare
Touched his techni-coloured hair
I left it bruised and black and lame
I left it running full of shame

Oh I'm a guilty one
And know what I have done
Yeah, I'm a troubled one
And I won't be forgiven

Guilty on the run
And I know what I have done
Guilty on the run
And I'm never forgiven

I was just a kid
That you could not forgive
Because it's harder

I was just a kid
And all I really wanted
Was my father

Spent years singing to forget, (to forget)
Spent years singing, ""no regret""
Then suddenly it all becomes clear
I've been sorry all these years

I was just a kid
That you could not forgive
Because it's harder

I was just a kid
And all I really wanted
Was my father

And I know what I have done
Guilty on the run
And I'm never forgiven

Fall into a restless sleep
While so many innocent die
That's why I sing

Hail to all of us
Hail to all of us down here

Maybe someday soon
When we've thought things over
We'll know what to do
But probably
There's a much bigger chance, you see
That it will all be gone

So I close my eyes and turn my head away
And just hope it'll be all right
Fall into a restless sleep
While so many others die

Be 100% when I'm with you and then

The stickler is you've played not one beat wrong
You never promised me anything
Even sat me down and warned me just how they fall
I knew the odds were I'd never win

Yet here I am

It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life

My self-worth measured in text back tempo
It's been two days and 8 minutes too slow
Well there may well be others but I still like to pretend
That I'm the one you really want to grow old with

Got a schedule to stick to, got a world to keep sweet
You're so much to everyone all the time
Will you ever slow down? Will I ever come first?
The universe contracts to sigh

It's a half life

A daft life

It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life

Hold me
Darling, please

You know you'll never be lonely, no you'll always be loved
And maybe you never need more than that
But for the surplus that loves, what's to become of us?
Does it even register on your conscience?

Long for one last showdown from a box in a crowd
Air compressed tight to explode
I'm clenching my ticket to the only way out
As you disappear in a puff of smoke

With you as my quarterback
A daft life"

He was a sucker for your double dose
Motherfucker turned white as a ghost
Don't you say hi?
Don't you say hi?
With a broken sink for a face
And a head that just takes up space
He's not half right
He's not half right
It's already half passed
And it wont last
I was sticking up for my friend
And there's nothing much to defend

Well, it's just like being alone

How did we get here? How the hell?
Pan left, close on the steeple of the church
How did I get here? How the hell?
Christmas, Christmas Eve, last year
How could a night so frozen,
Be so scalding hot?
How could a morning so mild,
Be so raw?
Why are entire years strewn
On the cutting room floor of memory?
When single frames of one magic night
Forever flicker in close up
On the 3D Imax of my mind
That's poetic
That's pathetic
Why did Mimi knock on Roger's door
And Collins choose that phone booth
Back where Angel set up his drums
Why did Maureen's equiptment break down
Why am I the witness?
And when I capture it on film
Will it mean that it's the end
And I'm alone"

He'd never toss you a line

If all we have is here and now
Honey, I won't change a thing
All I know is how I feel
When you move your snow white hand in mine
I'll never hold the hands of time

From the moment we are born
We're in the hands of time
As drunk on life as death is sober
When we say goodbye
Though it hurts to lose a friend
May it help remembering
For every door that closes in
One will open to the other side
Opened by the hands of time

Heaven knows there are days when it flies on by
Heaven knows there are days when it drags
Though it may seem to be on your side
Turn around, it's left you high and dry
And that is why

It's a fool who reaches out
To the hands of time
If all we have is here and now
Honey, I won't change a thing
All I know is how I feel
When you move your snow white hand in mine
I'll never hold the hands of time

Feel it hands upon the strings
As the music starts to ring
In my soul, in my dreams
For to help these melodies and rhymes
Become this song, hands of time

I just don't know what is wrong with you and me
Touch me and then turn away and put your hands into the flame

Tell me if you feel this pain
'Cause I don't want to be a ball and chain, no

I just can't keep hanging on to you and
I just don't know what is wrong with you and me
I just can't keep hanging on to you and me

You and me
You and me"
hangman,madder mortem,"I know that death hides in my eyes
And screams from my song
I've left the bright lights
Left for the river without bridges
Slow and silent:
In it's waters I can dream of peace
I know of no hope
Down and into the flood will be my way

And to my hangman I will bow
My scaffold will follow me down
Sing as the soul falls
Over the water your voice lingers
Just be by my side
When the river sweeps my feet away
Though I gave you no hope
And all your love I have repaid with pain

I will go down
Stay with me
My light is all gone
Stay with me"
happy day,cherry filter,"난 내가 말야 20살쯤엔
요절할 천재인 줄만 알고
어릴 땐 말야 모든 게 다
간단하다 믿었지

이제 나는
딸기향 해열제 같은
환상적인 해결책이 필요해
징그러운 일상에 불을 지르고
어디론가 도망갈까

찬란하게 빛나던 내 모습은
어디로 날아갔을까 어느 별로
작은 일에도 날 설레게 했던
내 안의 그 무언가는
어느 별에 묻혔나

가끔 울리는 전화 벨소리
두근거리며 열어보면
역시 똑같은 이상한
광고 메시지일 뿐 야

이제 여기 현실은 삼류 영화 속
너무 뻔한 일들의 연속이야
징그러운 일상은 멈춰 세우고
어디론가 도망갈까

거칠 것이 없었던 내 모습은
어디로 사라졌을까 어느 틈에
작은 일에도 늘 행복했었던
예전 그대로의 모습 찾고 싶어

찬란하게 빛나던 내 모습은
어디로 날아갔을까 어느 별로
작은 일에도 날 설레게 했던
내 안의 그 무언가는
어느 별에 묻혔나

찬란하게 빛나던 내 모습은
어디로 날아갔을까 어느 별로
작은 일에도 날 설레게 했던
내 안의 그 무언가는
어느 별에

거칠 것이 없었던 내 모습은
어디로 사라졌을까 어느 틈에
작은 일에도 늘 행복했었던
예전 그대로의 모습
다시 찾고만 싶어"
happy ending,mika,"This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory, no happy ending
This is the way that we love, like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life, but not together

Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
Can't get no love without sacrifice
If anything should happen, I guess I wish you well
A little bit of Heaven, but a little bit of Hell

This is the hardest story that I've ever told
No hope, or love, or glory
Happy endings gone forever more
I feel as if I'm wastin'
And I'm wastin' every day

This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory, no happy ending
This is the way that we love, like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life, but not together

Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
I can get to my sleep, I can think that we just carried on

This is the hardest story that I've ever told
No hope, or love, or glory
Happy endings gone forever more
I feel as if I'm wastin'
And I'm wastin' every day

Oh, I feel as If I'm wastin' (this is the way you left me, I'm not pretending)

And I'm wastin' every day (this is the way that we love, like it's forever)

happy song,baby's gang,"We are down, we are crazy fools everyday at school
Teachers here, teachers there
Books and books, they are everywhere
Come on boys, we need to dance
We have got a good chance
Lay your problems on the floor
Clap your hands and sing once more

Everybody, let's go to the ""King""
We can dance there, dance and eat an ice-cream
Everybody dancing all night long
Try to do it, sing a happy song

Music, dancing in the night
We can get so high
For no reason no long stop
Now's the time to go to the top
It's a sweeter happy song
We'll sing all night long
Lay your problems on the floor
Clap your hands and sing once more

It must have been

It must have been a happy time

The sun would shine
The candy bars
Kool Aid flowing like wine
The comic books

The TV shows
The bubble gum
The kitty cat

I was a time traveller
Listening to the heavenly laughter
Laurie was always with me
Ever after for ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever

CHORUS

THe picture drawing
The pretend heroes
My favorite was Captain America
The little girl
The flowers in the yard
The dog and cat
The welcome mat

God told me to go out
Singing my songs and what not
Led me to the hoy river baptism
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy

CHORUS

The GI Joes
The plastic monsters
My dad's model airplanes
Life magazines
The Bible stories
Kimba the Lion
The King Kong

I was a cosmic child wlaking the second mile
I had to defeat the aliens
Bloody battle, fight to the finish
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight

harbour,moby feat. sinead o'connor,"The street bears no relief
When everybody's fighting
The street bears no release
With lights so hot and biting

I run the stairs away
And walk into the nighttime
The sadness flows like water
And washes down the heartache

And washes down the heartache

My heart is full
My heart is mild
The saddest songs are played
On the strings of my heart

The heat is on its own
The roof seems so inviting
A vantage point is gained
To watch the children fighting

So lead me to the harbour
And float me on the waves
Sink me in the ocean
To sleep in a sailor's grave

To sleep in a sailor's grave

My heart is full
My heart is mild
The saddest songs are played
On the strings of my heart

My heart is full
My heart is mild, so mild
The saddest songs are played
On the strings of my heart"
hard times,baby huey,"Cold, cold eyes upon me they stare
People all around me and they're all in fear
They don't seem to want me but they won't admit
I must be some kind of creature up here having fits

From my party house, I'm afraid to come outside
Although I'm filled with love I'm afraid they'll hurt my pride
So I play the part I feel they want of me
And I pull the shades so I won't see them seein' me

Havin' hard times in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found
Havin' hard times, in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found

From my party house I feel like meetin' others
Familiar faces, creed and race, a brother
But to my surprise I find a man corrupt
Although he be my brother, he wants to hold me up

Havin' hard times in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found
Havin' hard times, in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found

So many hard times...
Sleepin' on motel floors
Knockin' on my brother's door
Eatin' Spam and Oreos and drinkin' Thunderbird baby

In this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found
Havin' hard times, in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found

I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of payin' dues baby
And I'm sick and tired of havin' so many hard, hard times baby
And from my party house, from my party house"
hard to find,the national,"I can see the glowing lights
I can see them every night
Really not that far away
I could be there in a day
I wonder if you live there still
I kinda think you always will
If I tried you'd probably be
Hard to find

What I feel now about you then
I'm just glad I can't explain
You're beautiful and close and young
In those ways we were the same
There's a lot I've not forgotten
I let go of other things
If I tried they'd probably be
Hard to find

They can all
Just kiss off into the air
They can all
Just kiss off into the air

I don't know why we had to lose
The ones who took so little space
We're still waiting for the ease
To cover what we can't erase
I'm not holding out for you
I'm still watching for the signs
If I tried you'd probably be
Hard to find

They can all
Just kiss off into the air
They can all
Just kiss off into the air"

And hate death

And hate sweat

I hate my way

I make you in to a song
I can't rise above the church
I'm caught in a jungle
Vines tangle my hands
I'm always so hot and it's hot in here
I say it's all right

My pillow screams too
But so does my kitchen
And water
And my shoes
And the road

I have a gun in my head
I'm invisible
I can't find the ice

A slug
I'm TV
I hate

A boy, he was tangled in his bike forever
A girl was missing two fingers
Gerry Ann was confused
Mr. Huberty
Had a gun in his head

So I sit up late in the morning
And ask myself again
How do they kill children?
And why do I want to die?
They can no longer move
I can no longer be still

I hate

Turbulence

You always jump and quiver
When you're coming in to land
With no runway, no guidance
No nails dug into my hand.

We could have whoever we want.
We could go back to school
And see the dead laugh again.
Let's get dressed up and pull.

The only benefit of drinking.
The downside of what we take.
Some weekends I feel
Like I could always be awake.

A party in a strangers house.
Have we ever met the host?
Just smile and keep talking
And get your can for a toast.

We won't always be safe here
But this is where we reign.
Pull it tight to protect us.
We might never sleep again."
haunted house,jumpin' gene simmons,"I just moved in my new house today
Movin' was hard but I got squared away
Bells started ringin' and chains rattled loud
I knew I'd moved in a haunted house

Still I made up in my mind to stay
Nothin' was a-gonna drive me away
When I seen somethin' that give me the creep
Had one big eye and a-two big feet

I stood right still and I did the freeze
He did the stroll right up to me
Made a noise with his feet that sound like a drum
(Say, you'll be here when the mornin' come?)

Say yes, I'll be here when the mornin' come
I'll be right here and I ain't gonna run
I bought this house now you know I am bold
Ain't no haint gonna run me off

In my kitchen my stove was a-blazin' hot
The coffee was a-boilin' in the pot
The grease had melted in my pan
I had a hunk of meat in my hand

From outer space there sat a man
On a hot stove with the pots and pans
""Say that's hot"" I began to shout
He drank a hot coffee right from the spout

He ate the raw meat right from my hand
Drank a hot grease from the fryin' pan
He said to me ""Now, you better run""
(Don't be here when the mornin' come)

Say yes, I'll be here when the mornin' come
I'll be right here and I ain't gonna run
I bought this house now you know I am bold"

I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander

Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge,
I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it

have a nice day,stereophonics,"San Francisco Bay, past pier thirty-nine
Early p.m, can't remember what time
Got the waiting cab stopped at the red light
Address, unsure of but it turned out just right

It started straight off, coming here is hell
That's his first words, we asked what he meant
He said, ""Where your from?"" we told him a lot
We take a holiday, is this what you want?

To have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Lie around all day, have a drink to chase
Yourself and tourists, yeah, that's what I hate
He said, ""We're going wrong"", we've all become the same
We dress the same ways, only our accents change

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Swim in the ocean that be my dish
I drive around all day and kill the processed fish
It's all money gum, no artists anymore
You're only in it now to it make more, more and more

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

have i told you lately,rod stewart,"Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you
You fill my heart with gladness
Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

For the morning sun and all it's glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort, too
You fill my life with laughter
And somehow, you make it better
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
Like the sun
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, to the one

Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you
You fill my heart with gladness
Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine

Take away all my sadness, fill my life with gladness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
Take away all my sadness, fill my life with gladness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do"
hawaii,mew,"You know time goes by fast like rain

From whisper to icy howl
You know time goes by fast like rain
It swallows your every sound
From whisper to icy howl
Good luck trying to be someone
If you make it then you've won
You'll grow up to be someone

I can't go without you
No, I need to have you
Have you met someone?
Have you touched the bottom?

The weather is like you
Third time's the charm
Like a dog it's breathing
They are just as lonely
And we all make mistakes once in a while
The weather is like you
Third time's the charm
Like a dog it's breathing

It was right beyond doubt
Things just didn't pan out
It's a movie set
It's a world constructed
I can't go without you
I'm a ghost to have you
Have you met someone?
Have you touched the bottom?

The weather is like you
Third time's the charm
Like a dog it's breathing
They are just as lonely
And we all make mistakes once in a while
The weather is like you
Here comes the charm
Like a dog it's breathing
They are just as lonely
And we all make mistakes once in a while
The weather is like you

he needs me,jon brion,"And all at once I knew, I knew at once
I knew he needed me
Until the day I die
I won't know why I knew he needed me

It could be fantasy, oh
Or maybe it's because

He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me

It's like a dime a dance: I'll take a chance
I will because he needs me
No one ever asked before, before
Because they never needed me
But I do (but he does!)

Maybe it's because he's so alone
Maybe it's because he's never had a home

He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me

For once, for once in life
I finally felt that someone needed me
And, if it turns out real
Then love can turn the wheel
Because

He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me

He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me"

head above water,theory of a deadman,"Did you ever picture life like this
No shooting star to grant your wish
Are you everything you hoped you'd be
I got somewhere in between
You dropped your miracle down a wishing well
And prayed for luck to cast it's spell
To bring you closer to your dreams
That always seem just out of reach
You pray to God, don't know when
But you feel the current pull you in
You try to keep your head above water
It's never been harder
Even when it feels hopeless
You're gonna get through this
Head above water
Gotta fight from going under
Even when it feels useless to wish
You're gonna get through this
Have you ever felt like giving in
Tried for hours but just can't win
Tell yourself you're not good enough
The struggle alone is just too much
No one's there to hear you scream
You gasp for air but cannot breathe
Did you ever think you'd see the day
When you'd watch your life get washed away
You pray to God, don't know when
But you feel the current pull you in
You try to keep your head above water
It's never been harder
Even when it feels hopeless
You're gonna get through this
Head above water
Gotta fight from going under
Even when it feels useless to wish
You're gonna get through this
Did it ever hurt so bad
That the thought of feeling lost
Would never end
Well you will think again
Try to keep your head above water
It's never been harder
When it feels hopeless
You're gonna get through this
Head above water
Gotta fight from going under
Even when it feels useless to wish
You're gonna get through this
Your head above water, never been harder
Tryin' to keep your head above water
Has never been harder
You're gonna get through this
You're gonna get through this"
head over heels,new found glory,"I wanted to be with you alone and talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance with a system of touch and gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration, could I need you this much
Oh, you're wasting my time, you're just, just, just wasting time
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away (Throw it away...Throw it away...)
I made a fire and watching it burn (yeah) Thought of your future
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last
No, no, no, have you no ambitions,
My mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air
And dreaming I'm a doctor
It's hard to be man when there's a gun in your hand
Oh, I feel so...
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels

Don't, don't, don't throw it away (don't throw it away)

headless horseman,the microphones,"HEADLESS HORSEMAN
I got hit hard I'm on the ground, and if you swing again I'll duck
but I wish you the best of luck you deserve yourself
and I'll return from my trip to hell, as a headless horseman
cause oh what a loss
I went back to get my stuff, and it was tangled up and tough
I stood there and stared you down, and I walked aimlessly around
with a flaming pumpkin head
oh, what a loss
my soft hands replaced by claws
you turned me into a stray dog, from a mighty human man
oh, what a loss
oh, what a loss
I miss my closest friend, and now I cling to rocks and wind
its a precious thing we lost"
heard 'em say,kanye west,"Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. West
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah

And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS

So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

Uh, and I heard 'em say (ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'

Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

Uh, uh, and I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh"
heart and soul,joy division,"Instincts that can still betray us
A journey that leads to the sun
Soulless and bent on destruction
A struggle between right and wrong

You take my place in the showdown
I'll observe with a pitiful eye
I'd humbly ask for forgiveness
A request well beyond you and I

Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn

An abyss that laughs at creation
A circus complete with all fools
Foundations that lasted the ages
Then ripped apart at their roots

Beyond all this good is the terror
The grip of a mercenary hand
When savagery turns all good reason
There's no turning back, no last stand

Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn

Existence well what does it matter?
I exist on the best terms I can
The past is now part of my future
The present is well out of hand

Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn"
heart attack,lloyd,"See every time we get together, man

Young Goldie, AD, if you ain't tryna let her go
You better let her know, huh, B street

You know they jockin', but I don't
Really give a damn what they's in for
'Cause what we had was special
And enough to make me never wanna leave home

Maybe you're right and I'm wrong
I was too young and dumb to notice
I know it looks bad but we don't
Have to deal with our problems alone

Now that I'm here, so won't you stop cryin'?
Have no fear 'cause I'ma start tryin'
Girl, it's so clear, without you, I'm dyin'
No, I can't let it end, so, girl, I'm checkin' in

Can somebody call the doctor?

Can somebody call the doctor?
And prescribe me somethin' that'll show me how to act

If she's gone, oh, woah
If she's gone, oh, woah
I won't, I can't go on, no

When you left, girl, it felt like (my heart stopped beating)
And my lungs stopped breathin'
And, baby, you're the reason I got to do right
The truth is that I, I ain't worth a damn without you

Just wanna take the time to slow it down
And cherish every moment that you're around
Let me change your mind about me now
And show you what my love is about

Now that I'm here, stop cryin'

If she's gone, what do I do? (Oh, woah)
If she's gone, oh, woah
(I don't know) I can't go on, no
(Please, don't go, don't go)

Okay, first time I met her, I remember it like yesterday
I was in my old school, she was in the Escalade
She pulled off on the exit, and then I pulled up next to her
No time for flexin' now, I knew I had to get next to her

All black Chanel shades, classy as she wanna be
Could tell how I'm jockin' she could have me if she wanted me
Now that I got her, I'ma need a doctor if she leave me
Girl, I need for you to know, I need you, baby

Can somebody call the doctor?
Shawty tryna give me a heart attack
Can somebody call the doctor?
And prescribe me somethin' that'll show me how to act

If she's gone, oh, woah
If she's gone, oh, woah
I won't, I can't go on, no (no)"

She want to fight with lame chicks, blow my day
She want to inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find a strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the new crib
She want to answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She call me ""Heartbreaker""
When we apart, it makes her
Want to get a piece of paper, scribble ""I hate ya""

She love everything Jay say, Jay does and uh

You know I never would have run away from my home

Heaven can wait
And all I got is time until the end of time
Well, I won't look back, I won't look back

heaven,angels & airwaves,"I will run the streets and hostile lands
I will touch the rain with all I have
I will breathe the air, and scream it loud
My feet will never touch the ground
Because the days they feel, like ancient blocks
Like when kids grow up, and learn to walk
Because your life is full of pure desire
A place so gloriously wired

The lights and sounds
Oh God, this is such a mess
And it's like our world, and we're the last ones left
And the hair, it stands on the back of our necks
And I swear, it shows
Heaven must be just like this.

Do you see the hills beneath the clouds?
And the stars as trails, to lead you out?
Can you sense the pain thats everywhere
And if you try, you'll never care
And the love you had when you were young
Is right outside for all to come
Because your life is full of pure desire
A place so gloriously wired

The lights and sounds
Oh God, this is such a mess
And it's like our world, and we're the last ones left
And the hair, it stands on the back of our necks
And I swear, it shows - Heaven must be just like this

If you see a light break through the clouds
And fire run like distant towers
And the world will begin, exactly how it ends
When you call for love when you are lost
Whatever more, whatever cost
And the world will begin, exactly how it ends

We're lost behind enemy lines
They're gunning for us oh
They never even met us oh

Now what happened to our heavy metal?
Now what happened to our coat of arms?
We will find that we're stuck in the middle
Picking up the pieces of our hearts

And there will be no comfort
For all that we have lost
The actors seemed so happy
But somehow ended all washed up

Now what happened to my heavy metal?
Guess what happened to my coat of arms?
We will find that we're stuck in the middle
Picking up the pieces of our hearts"

Something exciting is gonna happen
Don't wanna share, don't wanna show
I want to be the only one to know

Grow on me, what's in there hiding?
I will fall through the wall of silence

Take off to a place I've never seen
I'll find it from my helicopter
Away from who I used to be
I'll get there in my helicopter

Don't worry now, don't make a promise
You know I won't ever be careless
I won't forget, won't change my mind
I won't kill anything I leave behind

Let me grow, there is no more hiding
Go, go, go, through the wall of silence

Take off to a place I've never seen
I'll find it from my helicopter
Away from who I used to be
I'll get there in my helicopter

Take off to a place I've never seen

Life is wonderful, there's only so much you can wonder about
Before life drives you mad, and before nobody cares
Before life drives you mad, and before nobody cares

There are only words, and words mean nothing at all
There's not a single word, to speak for my rambling around
But I was searching for something, a sleepless night, painless and drugged
Oh I was searching for something, a sleepless night, painless and drugged

Time means nothing at all, it's a mark of the living to die
Space is gonna fall, and the Sun's meant to stare us straight in the eye
So maybe you will feel fire, maybe some day your love is wild
Maybe you will feel fire, maybe some day your love is wild

Heaven is an endless pit, I can fall forever but I'd never make it
Hell is all that you know, cause you've been hurt and you've walked on coals
And you crush under every command, hell on Earth is what life's always been
Yeh, you crush under every command, hell on Earth is what life's always been"

Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

I think I'm gonna build a fence
To keep inside what little sense
The sense of taste
The sense of smell
The sense to sit here and feel like hell
To feel like hell

The sun, the moon, the stars
Is that what you're thinking that you are
As I'll disintegrate over time
If I expect my Body to try and keep up with my mind

Outside the music hall you come out for some air
Until your curtain call and everyone just stared
When you took the stage that night
Somethings not right

You left all the lights burning but nobodies home
I believe they deceived your tuneful heart to long
And they sing along

So you think you cleverer than me ('Cause you so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen (Drama queen)
'Cause it's where you're at, not where you've been
So what do you expect from me (What do you want?)
To hold your head above the sea (Keep you high and dry)
And carry you, even though you bigger
'Cause don't you know, you crush my tiny figure
And anyway, we're still so young (Yeah, I'm so young)
And this isn't yesterday

I can't help you, if you won't help yourself (I can't help you)
No, I can't help you, if you don't help yourself (You won't help yourself)

hemingway,bløf,"Onder de zon en een hemelsblauwe hemel
Wachten straten op bewoners
Of voorbijgangers van ver
Ik spits mijn oren en probeer iets te doorgronden
Waarvan ik het bestaan vermoed
Maar niets echt zeker weet

Hoor je de stad?
Mijn hemelse verslaving
Voel je de adem?
Tussen de schemer en de avond
Verdwaal ik elke keer

En de stem van de zee
Neemt me mee naar huis
Ik ben geen Hemingway

Debajo de la luna y un cielo estrellado
Mujeres esperan sus hombres
O las gentes que pasan
Tomandome mi mojito, imaginando
De donde vengo despues del viaje
Y que abrazo mi amada

Pruebas el mar?
Mi corazón escondido
Scientes el aire
Entre la madrugada y el sol
Siempre me pierdo
Y el sonido del mar
Me devuelve a casa
No soy Hemingway

En de stem van de zee (Y el sonido del mar)
Neemt me mee naar huis (Me devuelve a casa)

here and now,swing out sister,"Here and now
Cold as the light of day
Seems like life slipped away
Like tears in the rain
What each heart had in store
Isn't there anymore
And no-one seems to know what it is they're really here for

We'll never learn to live and grow
If we don't let our feelings show
Everyone of us

Here and now
Can't stop what's happening
Head over heels and falling helplessly in love
Here and now
Reaching an all time high
Head over heals
In love with life

Hear and now
What seemed so far away
Stumbled and found us here
And showed us the way
To find in our hearts again
This is where love begins
We'll make our dreams come true
If we still keep on believing
No matter what we'll be prepared
The futures ours for us to share
Every one of us

Here and now
Can't stop what's happening
Head over heels and falling helplessly in love
Here and now
Reaching and all time high
Head over heels

Tomorrow can wait
Let time run away with us
Free as the air that we breathe
Until then nothing exists
Nothing compares to this
Even in our wildest dreams
Here and now
Here and now
Here and now"

My embarrassment versus your damp face
We could talk down here or we could talk in bed
But I'm afraid that's all, as I've already said"
here with me,mercyme,"I long for your embrace
Every single day
To meet you in this place
And see you face to face

Will you show me?
Reveal yourself to me
Because of your mercy
I fall down on my knees

And I can feel your presence here with me
Suddenly I'm lost within your beauty
Caught up in the wonder of your touch
Here in this moment I surrender to your love

You're everywhere I go
I am not alone
You call me as your own
To know you and be known

You are holy
And I fall down on my knees

I can feel your presence here with me
Suddenly I'm lost within your beauty
Caught up in the wonder of your touch
Here in this moment I surrender to your love

I surrender to your grace
I surrender to the one who took my place

I can feel your presence here with me
Suddenly I'm lost within your beauty
Caught up in the wonder of your touch
Here in this moment I surrender to...

I can feel your presence here with me
Suddenly I'm lost within your beauty
Caught up in the wonder of your touch
Here in this moment I surrender to your love"
"here, there and everywhere",paul mccartney,"To lead a better life I need the love of my own
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I want be here, there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere"
heroes,alesso,"We could hide away in daylight
We go undercover, wait out the sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty, that's where we run

Every day people do everyday things, but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind
We can do anything

We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be

Anybody's got the power
They don't see it 'cause they don't understand
Spinnin' round and round for hours
You and me, we got the world in our hands

Every day people do everyday things, but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind
We can do anything

We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you

Stick solutions in the vein.

The dawning of a newer self.

At least not yet.

We both knew we should
You do at our age

This stage of our career
Things get tight
A ring helps get a mortgage

To move out of daddy's home
Get a bigger car
Easy access to the city

I can read the papers in peace
And laugh at the homeless
I know my friends criticise

But we get by okay
So what if there's no emotion
We can wake up anywhere

There's never a row
No time for a kiss
When you've got schedules to meet
Trivialities seem so cheap

This is more than real
This is all there is
This is as good as it gets
Intense morality parades"

When busy streets
Amass with people would stop to hold
Their heads heavy

Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
All those years
They were here first

Oily marks appear on walls
Where pleasure moments hung before
The takeover
The sweeping insensitivity of this
Still life

Trains and sewing machines (You won't catch me around here)
Blood and tears

Facing our fear, standing out there alone

There must be someone who's feeling for me

In this whole world, what's fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love I've been thinking of?

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel the love come over me
Let me feel how strong it can be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above for this higher love"

I need a kick, you need a fix
We are livin' on borrowed time
Generation breakdown destination hellbound
But I know that nothin' lasts forever
Hallucinating, stuck together
There's a highlight let me be
Only you and me

It will blow me away
I will never forget
It took a piece of my soul

One day I will burn my hand
And i'll be resurrected in the promised land
Among the gods I feel power and joy
I made my choice but nothin' will last forever
In my dreams
There's a highlight let me be
Don't let me out

Nothin' will last forever

There's a highlight can't you see
Only you and me

Nothin' will last forever

Yo, Thor-El, just just check your mic

So you wanna be the Million Dollar Man, kid, what's your plan?
Make a deal with the Devil, settle for a hundred grand
Not enough, I call your bluff, hit you with the stuff
Deal with this an' think you're tough?
Gimme a call when things get rough

You get no Vette an' if I could stay leaded
I'm leavin' rappers one-legged from fakin' like the prosthetic
More artificial by cripple, rap is like your pistol
Grim Reaper, I got the whistle, death, I pull no tissue

Hit you like the Mac-11, MC's subtract by seven
Callin', callin' for the Reverend, lookin' at Hell like Heaven
I'm on the map, makin' it like the crazy on the track
Oh, what the hell, I get my mail while I raid you 'til it crack

H.I.P.H.O.P., we are
H.I.P.H.O.P., we are

Dead, two in the head before some A an' R tell me
I must give up the streets, you lift the company, can sell me
What's the sense in being large if you can't take a risk?
Thinkin' a risk upon a disc means you're written off the list

I'm not sayin' you can't have your fame an' glory just don't bore me
When I come to see you live an' I paid twenty-five
That's crazy loot Kris is sayin', I don't play those games
'Killing Rhyme Sessions' is the meanin' of my name

But don't call my name in vain 'cause I will appear
An' your livest MC will get slain right here
See, I do the homework an' I do the extra credit
You could sell a million records an' still can't set it

'Cause the Lex or Beem is probably just the matches an' a Jeep
So I'm sure your rap career, now if they come before your people
Oh, Lord, you can't be thinkin' about Billboard
With the mic cord an' several thousand people just bored

Bein' dope live is like bein' insured for life
You always get called back twice, you are

H.I.P.H.O.P., we are
H.I.P.H.O.P., we are
H.I.P.H.O.P., we are

Rappers that die, but why? Explain the obvious

history lesson,boyd rice and friends,"History's lesson is written in the blood of the vanquished, it is spelled down in the ruins of forgotten civilisation, in their monuments to their grandour, and the monuments to their falling.
History's lesson reveals that war is the father of all and the king of all And some he has made gods, some men, some bond, and some free
The history of the world is the history of wars
It is the history of people preying upon people and people resisting predation It's a struggle of competing societies to survive in a world of natural, biological and socio-political strife
That is why it is so difficult to turn a single page of history without reading of war, combat, strife, revolution, uprising, invasion, insurrection, strike or some form of violence
The great heroes of history are the mass murderes of history
Alexander the great, Charlemagne, Genghis Khan, and on and on and on...
During the first middle of the century, more than 70 million people were killed per the results of wars, revolutions, insurrections, rebellions, massacres, assassinations, executions, exterminations, genocides, and so forth
History's lesson reveals that war is the father of all
And the king of all
And some he has made gods, some men, some bond, and some free"

To trace every echo
Back to its birth?
Why is it impossible now
To kiss every fever away?

There is truth that's hiding
Behind every wall that surrounds us.
It takes a lifetime
To pull the bricks away.

Why is it impossible now?
Why is it impossible now?
(Is this the way to understand, to understand)

With the weakest of ears
We'll try only to hear
The sound of our voice,
Louder than fear of waking up
Alone.

Let conversations carry
The unraveling of skin.
The ink will pour an answer
In children's handwriting.

If all words are cameras,
Hold still.
Shutters slide to unveil
Fingerprints of angels
And a language made of film.

With surgical precision,
We'll cut every piece into order.
And beneath soft faces,
We'll climb halfway to God.

Sideways, it's forbidden
Better get the guiden

Soon as niggas open they mouth i start shittin
Right down they neck, they threw the whole nine
Seen you fools scopin my plans the whole time
Said i couldn't rhyme, that's funny
Women didn't want it but now they yell honey
Bring 'em to the house
Watch 'em come out the blouse
Unzip the pants then watch the snake dance
Assume the stance, cash in advance
I got the full package but watch the right hand

Bring it to the front to pump with no frills

I do a backflip, then pirouette inject
Plus be the nigga that never lost a bet

And now my career ain't big enough for three
Still down with 'em, can talk and laugh with 'em
But tell you one thing, can't split it in half with 'em
Half a 1/3 to me sounds absurd
I rather keep a 100% to pay rent
Lay out the prints, the plans to stand grande
And keep the joint jumpin from philly to san fran

And I remembered the cold of winter running up the legs of my pants.
I picked the nicest lawn and imagined the two of us rolling around down along the ground.
I saw myself touch your face and I noticed jets begin to race above our heads.
But I pinched my arm and remembered how much you hate me.
I remembered the fact that I can't see what you need
And I'm too stupid to be aware of the beauty that you give this place
And how shitty this town would be without you in it.

So I lose some sales and my boss won't be happy
But there's only one thing on my mind
Searching boxes underneath the counter
On a chance that on a tape I'd find
A song for
Someone who needs somewhere

To long for

Homesick
Cause I no longer know
Where home is"
homeward,the sundays,"You've stolen my heart and I want you to remember
Now what'll I do? living alone
You've stolen my heart and it hurts me to remember
Now where'll I go to? living alone
And a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
It's dumb - I know what I want to say
But I can't even take one breath
As night falls I hear voices on the radio
(Ooh) I'll follow their dreams
And wake up alone
And a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
It's dumb - I know what I want to say
But I can't even take one breath
So now still burning silently away
A storm without the thunder"
homicide,logic,"Son, you know why you the greatest alive?
Why, Dad?
Because you came out of my balls, nigga
Hahahahahaha

Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady with rabies

I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration
But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school ""He's cool, he's not"" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit

Fuck rap

Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady

There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide
Hit 'em with that (Do-do-do) and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place
But if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked
You gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)

Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said ""Rover"" because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said
I still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm about to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins
Lapkins and chapki-
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'
Flamminababbitapannitajampkin, dammit, a can of pada-"
honest man,my morning jacket,"Try to walk this earth an honest man,
But eveil waves at me its ugly hand.
The radar watches me from above, shouting down:
""I hope you make it on this earth.""
Sometimes this world will leave you, lord,
Kickin and a screamin, wonderin if you'll see the next day through.
But as for me I do believe that good luck comes from tryin,
So until I get mine ill work me the whole day through."
honestly,blue sky black death,"You were so close to the cliff
I didn't even care to notice
Rain fell over our heads
My throat trembled and said
I cover myself with your eyes
Cover myself for the first time
See to it that I will have you
Capture you when the warmth comes
Learn how your body moves
When I am next to you
You are the whiskey on my lips
Holding it when I am so far
I choose to forget your name
Far away it will all be the same
Have you break me oh in two
Every time I have to leave you
[Chorus:]
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
This will come down so hard
We will ache for a new start
In so oh absent arms
To this we'll fall apart
I will arrive on a rainy day
Show face oh at your door
You will tell me all the ways
That I will want you more
On my living room floor
So well I will explore
I will feel this even when
I cannot breathe you in
I don't remember the taxi ride
You will forget how I feel on the insides
This will mean nothing in time
In time this will mean nothing
[Chorus:]
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
In time this will mean nothing
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me

Junk boats and English boys
Crashing out in super marts
Electric fences and guns
You swallow me
I'm a pill on your tongue
Here on the nineteenth floor
The neon lights make me come
And late in a star's life
It begins to explode
And all the people in a dream
Wait for the machine
Pick the shit up leave it clean

Kid, hang over here
What you learning in school?
Is the rise of an Eastern sun
Gonna be good for everyone?

The radio station disappears
Music turning to thin air
The DJ was the last to leave
She had well conditioned hair
Was beautiful, but nothing really was there"
hooray,minus the bear,"It's cold, and snow's actually on the ground
Of this no-snow town
And instead of cars
Streets trafficking in sleds
Men become boys again
There's a war on the corner
With no guaranteed winner
It's just a snowfall of snowballs
Evidence of the winter
And I can feel my hands again
We're almost home
It's 2 PM and our snow is fallin' still
As our good city lay still
And our friends are packed
Around some no smoking bar
Warmin' on alcohol
We step into the silence
Yeah, we step slowly and quiet
All boys come on and girls join up
Just don't grow old
All boys come on and girls join up
We're almost home
this is all we want
Time to be with us
A home to lift the cold
Still cold, the snow's
Turning into rain
And melting away
And all these days slip by us
So let's keep them
All boys come on and girls join up
Just don't grow old
All boys come on and girls join up
We're almost home
We're almost home"

houses,judy collins,"You have many houses, one for every season
Mountains in your windows, violets in your hands
Through your English meadows your blue-eyed horses wander
You're in Colorado for the spring

When the winter finds you, you fly to where it's summer
Rooms that face the ocean, moonlight on your bed
Mermaids swift as dolphins paint the air with diamonds
You are like a seagull as you said

Why do you fly bright feathered sometimes in my dreams?
The shadows of your wings fall over my face
I can feel no air, I can find no peace
Brides in black ribbons, witches in white
Fly in through windows, fly out through the night

Why do I think I'm dying sometimes in my dreams
I see myself a child running through the trees
Searching for myself, looking for my life
Looking everywhere crawling on my knees
I cannot see the leaves, I cannot see the light

Then I see you walking just beyond the forest
Walking very quickly, walking by yourself
Your shoes are silver, your coat is made of velvet
Your eyes are shining, your voice is sweet and clear
""Come on"", you say, ""Come with me, I'm going to the castle""

All the bells are ringing, the weddings have begun
But I can only stand here, I cannot move to follow
I'm burning in the shadows and freezing in the sun

There are people with you living in your houses
People from your childhood who remember how you were
You were always flying, nightingale of sorry
Singing bird with rainbows on your wings"

Down on the valley, riddled with horses runnin'
Crushin' them with flowers

An' rattles my cage like a thunderstorm

What does it mean? What does it mean to be so sad?
When someone you love
Someone you love is supposed to make you happy

What do you do, how do you keep love alive?
When it won't

What, what are the words they use
When they know it's over?
""We need to talk,"" or ""I'm confused
Maybe later you can come over""

On the day you was born
She runs through my veins like a long black river
An' rattles my cage like a thunderstorm

So, tell me before I leave, how do you sleep?

Wish I could erase you from my mind
Take away the pain I feel inside
Like a fool you didn't realize
Boy, you know I saw right through your lies

I'm gonna throw all those things away
You gave to me to make me wanna stay
I heard you never, never can anyway
Don't think that I'll be coming back someday

So, tell me why you trying so hard
Well, just to break my heart
Kept on pulling me in, thought I would give in
So, tell me before I leave, how do you sleep?

So, tell me why you trying so hard
Well, just to break my heart
Kept on pulling me in, thought I would give in
So, tell me before I leave, how do you sleep?"
how does it feel,avril lavigne,"I'm not afraid of anything
I just need to know that I can breathe
And I don't need much of anything
But suddenly, suddenly

I am small and the world is big
All around me is fast moving
Surrounded by so many things
Suddenly, suddenly

How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel?

I am young and I am free
But I get tired and I get weak
I get lost and I can't sleep
But suddenly, suddenly

How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel?

Would you comfort me?
Would you cry with me?

I am small and the world is big
But I'm not afraid of anything
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?

How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?

How does it feel to be different from me?

how i feel,alexz johnson,"I know how this all must look
Like a picture ripped from a story book
I've got it easy
I've got it made

There's a golden road laid out before me
And everyone how they adore me
Like a diamond
In the sun

Did you just waste your breath
Asking me how I feel today
Or do you really want to know

I'm completely unconnected
Constantly rejected
Like everything I've ever loved is coming down
I'm drowning in emotion
In the middle of the ocean
Never knowing when it's over and I'm going down

That's how I feel

I know I signed up for this game
And everybody knows my name
Now they own a little piece of me
My happiness fell off the track
And I'd do anything to get it back
Give this all, I'd give it all away

Did you just waste your breath
Asking me how I feel today
Is that a place you wanna go

I'm completely unconnected
Constantly rejected
Like everything I've ever loved is coming down
I'm drowning in emotion
In the middle of the ocean
Never knowing when it's over and I'm going down

Then you see me
You say you don't even know me
Couldn't pick me out of a lineup
The girl you know is so far-gone
And I'm in hiding
Living life undercover
Smiling face for the camera
I'm not long for this world

I'm completely unconnected
Constantly rejected
Like everything I've ever loved is coming down
I'm drowning in emotion
In the middle of the ocean
Never knowing when it's over and I'm going down

That's how I feel

Then you see me
Say you don't even know me"
how low,josé gonzález,"How low are you willing to go
Before you reach all your selfish goals
Punch line after punch line
Leaving us sore, leaving us sore
Absorbed in your ill hustling
Feeding a monster, just feeding a monster
Invasion after invasion
This means war, this means war
Someday you'll be up to your knees
In the shit you see
All the gullible that you mislead
Won't be up or it
Where to, will you relocate
Now that it's war, now that it's war"

But I know that you're so confused and afraid
I just want to be one true thing that don't fade
I don't wanna give up tomorrow
I just can't understand why we're going away

You try so hard to be heard
You try so hard to not hurt
I give you nothing to doubt and you doubt me

humiliation,jay-jay johanson,"Underneath this surface exists
A man with no strength to resist
Lips are sealed unable to speak
If you don't take these chains off me
I hesitate too scared to believe
Disregard the way I feel
The time has come for you to decide
Naked respect without denial

How could I forgive and forget
When you ignore and you regret
Silent words, full of despise
There's no return, some things must die
Humiliation
I don't understand myself
Humiliation
I don't recognize myself anymore"
hungry,common,"Common:
Yo, niggaz don't want none of this
Niggaz know they can't fuck with this
Turn this shit up just a little more

I walk the night in rhymin armor, bomb a nigga like a winter coat
Have him on Death Row searchin for an Interscope
Yet I sparkle like Irene Cara
Symbolize dope, like sirens do terror
Mariel just had a baby someone else decapitated
Flashbacks of past raps make me so glad I made it
Players is gettin traded
I drop a gem off, them who's style is jaded
My juice is grated
Shit is so bangin niggaz say it's gang related
On philosopher's rink of thought, I've skated with precision
Crews is gettin split like decisions
Com will let it ride in collision
Vision like Colleco or tele, I battle stars in stellar...
Regions, my thought scheme was my like my offspring
Now, it's teethin
My reason of rhyme applies to season and time
Season of mind, body and regions divine
In mom's cookouts, I'm leavin the swine
Verbal vegeterian, squashed beef with Ice Cube
Came in this rap life nude
Now I'm fully clothed with flows
You tricks can't hide behind expensive cars and clothes
Old niggaz I expose like Luke does hoes in videos
With classic material, imperial and rugged like
Got mag, but my slugs a mic
You fake like a smile, like a hug, I'm tight
Skip ladies, this is rip a muthafucka night
Oracle arouse, niggaz don't even run for cover right
Downtown interracial lovers hold hands
I breathe heavy like an old man, with a cold can of Old Style
Hold a Stone Isle profile
Mix between Malcolm X and Sef when I go wild
Hold mics like a second nut until the second comin
Hummin comin towards you with power like forest do
Hip hop, you my bitch and like a Ford, I'm Explorin you
So, wack niggaz be cool, with them, I stay cordial
Flowin room temperature, cats is presumed miniature
Like golf. Soft like Tiger Woods
And real nigga angles I've stood with ways that's geometric
Don't need to rob banks with dike broads to Set it
I levitate to the occasion, lounge like a lyricist
Rhyme wise, you a rest haven
You sat by the door spooked like I was Wes Craven
You need to do more deletin and less savin
A praise in hell, raisin heaven
Like the bill on my pager leavens
What you should have known from day one
You will on day seven

hurry,sleeping at last,"Hurry, hurry
Come quickly
And leave all logic aside
Don't say a word
Just listen carefully to me...

""The world is ours if we could only let it be""

Every move we make
Will trigger another
And evrey small mistake
Will be a messenger...

""The world is ours if we could only let it be
The world is ours if we would only let it be.""

Our lives are weaving like a thread
Within each other, faithfully
Sharing in our joys and miseries
And all that the world can give

Always, always

In the depths of our souls
Flickers of hope will show so clear
Like a pearl in the sea
A pearl in the sea

(The smiles on faces born in farmilliar places
We'll build ourselves islands upon the deepest oceans)

For the last time
This could be the last time
To pull it from the water
To wear around our necks

""The world is ours if we could only let it be
The world is ours if we would only let it be""

Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry"
hurt,christina aguilera,"Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today
Ooh, ooh

I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you
But I know you won't be there

Oh I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you

Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye
When it comes to this, ooh, ah

Would you tell me I was wrong?
Would you help understand?
Are you looking down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes
And see you looking back

Oh I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself, ohh

If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I've missed you
Since you've been away
Ooh, it's dangerous
It's so out of line
To try and turn back time

I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
By hurting you"

He stayed in this place called Trendy Garden you know what I'm sayin?
He used to grow his vegetables right there on the side of the house
And every now and then he'd get me to help him out know what I'm sayin?
And as he was like weedin out his garden and everything
He'd sing all kinda tunes and hymns know what I'm sayin?
And sometime he'd sing the same one like over and over and over again
You know what I'm sayin?
He'd get tired of singin' the words
Sometimes he'd take a sip of his water outta that glass jar, set it back down
And while we was plantin' them collard greens, he'd hum it
Just like this right here, help me out 'cause, you know how we used to do it)
It gets all in my hands
It gets all in my feet
It makes me want to sing my song
To every little girl I meet
It gets all in my heart
It gets all in my sole
It comes straight out my mouth

'Cause I, I got this feelin', that everything's gonna be all right
Be all right

Rain falling around me
Lookin down at a worm
With a long way to go
And the traffic was hissing by
And i was homesick
And i was high

I was surrounded by a language
In which i could say only hello
And i thank you very much
But you spoke so i could understand
And i drew a treasure map on your hand

And you were no picnic
You were no prize
But you had just enough pathos
To keep me hypnotized
Hypnotized

The map led ro an island
In a seas of store-bought dreams
Where soulless singers sang
Over beats built by machines

And lovely girls were hovering
Above my head like gulls
With their long slender necks
And their delicate skulls

And i was no picnic
I was no prize
But i had just enough sweetness
To keep you hypnotized
Hypnotized

So that's how you found me
Rain falling around me
Lookin down at a worm
With a long way to go"

In a deep and dark December

I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pains
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock I am an island

Don't talk of love
Well I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries"

Life’s not worth a damn
‘Till you can say
Hey world!
I am what I am
I am what I am
I don’t want praise I don’t want pity
I bang my own drum
Some think it’s noise, I think it’s pretty
And so what if I love each feather and each bangle
Why not see things from a different angle
Your life is a shame
Till you can shout out loud
I am what I am
I am what I am
And what I am needs no excuses
I deal my own deck
Sometimes the aces sometimes the deuces
There’s one life and there’s no return and no deposit
One life so it’s time to open up your closet
Life’s not worth a dam till you can say
Hey world!
I am what I am"
i am,killing heidi,"I know, I know, I know, I know what you'd say here
I know, I know, I know, I know all the games you play
I am, I am, I am, I am not afraid because
I know, I know, I know, I know what to say

I feel it
It's coming
It's here if you want it and

I am, out on my own
Moving in shadow
Nobody knows who I am
Standing alone
And it's me, but you can't see who I am

I'd like to rip you out of your skin
I'd switch us around and
Put you back in and
I know, I know, I know, I know what to say here
But it couldn't be any other way

Cause I feel it
It's coming
It's here if you want it and

I am, out on my own
Moving in shadow
Nobody knows who I am
Standing alone
And it's me, but you can't see who I am

So close but you don't know
And it's me but you can't see (x6)

I feel it
It's coming
It's here if you want it

I am, out on my own
Moving in shadow
Nobody knows who I am
Standing alone
And it's me, but you can't see who I am

So close but you don't know
And it's me but you're never gonna see who I am
So close but you don't know
And it's me but you just can't see who I am"
i believe in love,dixie chicks,"I made a promise to myself
Locked it away, deep-down inside
Told my heart we'd wait it out
Swore we'd never compromise

Oh, I'd rather be alone
Like I am tonight
Than settle for the kind of love
That fades before the morning light

Silence stared me in the face
And I finally heard its voice
It seemed to softly say
That in love you have a choice

Today I got the answer
And there's a world of truth behind it
Love is out there waiting somewhere
You just have to go and find it

I believe in love
I believe in love
Love that's real
Love that's strong
Love that lives on and on
Yes, I believe in love

I believe in love
I believe in love
Love that's real
Love that's strong
Love that lives on and on
Yes, I believe in love
Yes, I believe in love"
i believe,blessed union of souls,"Walk blindly to the light and reach out for his hand
Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand
Open up your mind and then open up your heart
And you will see that you and me aren't very far apart
'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
Violence is spread worldwide and theres families on the street
We sell drugs to children now, oh why can't we just see?
That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay
But I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way

I've been seeing Lisa now, for a little over a year
She says she's never been so happy, but Lisa lives in fear
That one day Daddy's gonna find out that she's in love
With a Nigger from the streets
Oh how he would lose it then, but she's still here with me
Cuz she believes that love will see it through
One day he'll understand
He'll see me as a person, not just a black man
'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find a way
Love will find the way
Love will find the way
Love will find the way"
i burn for you,sting,"Now that I have found you
In the coolth of your evening smile
For the shade of your parasol
And your love flows through me

Though I drink at your pool
I burn for you
I burn for

You and I are lovers
When night time folds around our bed
In peace we sleep entwined
And your love flows through me

Though an ocean soothes my head
I burn for you
I burn for you

Stars will fall from dark skies
As ancient rocks are turning
Quiet fills the room
And your love flows through me

Though I lie here so still
I burn for you
I burn for you"
i can barely breathe,just surrender,"Tell me girl what were you thinking?
Hit me with something that will make this worth my time
Take it back, take it all back now
Every promise I made was just another mistake with you

Tell the truth if you think that you can take it
But I know, you wont
I never felt so all alone
But when it was safe I turned my back and the blade came through

And I can barely breathe
And I can barely breathe
And I can barely breathe

Stand on top of the roof top wondering
Is it good? Yea it's good for jumping
Take back every word you said
Cause I can barely breathe
(And I can barely breathe)

Tell me now can you still taste him?
Cause you know you'll never wash your hands of this
Take it back, take it all back now
Every drunken kiss that landed on his lips from you

Make a move if you think that you can make it
But I know, you wont
I never felt so all alone
But when it was safe I turned my back and the blade came through

And I can barely breathe
And I can barely breathe
And I can barely breathe

Stand on top of the roof top wondering
Is it good? Yea it's good for jumping
Take back every word you said
Cause I can barely breathe
(And I can barely breathe)

Stand on top of the roof top wondering
Is it good? Yea it's good for jumping
Take back every word you said
Cause I can barely breathe
(And I can barely breathe)

Hold your tongue
You know nothing about this
Don't even get involved

I hope you watch as I'm falling down
Because you are the reason I'm hitting the ground

You could be the one that breaks me
You will be the one that breaks me now

I hope you know that every tear you cried
Is a memory left from when you watch me die

You know I'll haunt your dreams
With all these pieces that you stole of me
Oh no

Stand on top of the roof top wondering
Is it good? Yea it's good for jumping
Take back every word you said
Cause I can barely breathe
(And I can barely breathe)

Stand on top of the roof top wondering
Is it good? Yea it's good for jumping
Take back every word you said
Cause I can barely breathe
(And I can barely breathe)"
i can hear music,the beach boys,"This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, oh, oh, oh
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all alone

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city, baby
Seems to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet, sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

Loving you
It keeps me satisfied
And I can't explain, oh no
The way I'm feeling inside
You look at me, we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city, baby
Seems to disappear, oh, when
I can hear music
Sweet, sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

I hear the music all the time, yeah
I hear the music, hold me tight now, baby
I hear the music all the time
I hear the music
I hear the music (baby)

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city, baby
Seems to disappear, oh, when
I can hear music
Sweet, sweet music"
i can't breathe,audiovent,"You want to feel me
Can't defeat me at your game
You buy and sell me
Separate me from my name

And I want you
To once invert the wrong
Cause I can't breathe
And I want you
To once admit I'm right

You come with something
But it's nothing that I need
You violate me
Have to break me to breathe

And I want you
To once invert the wrong
Cause I can't breathe
And I want you
To once admit I'm right

You point your finger
I'll play that game
With you, with you
I just can't beleive
Things we say

And I want you
To once invert the wrong
Cause I can't breathe
And I want you
To once admit I'm right"
i can't lie,shea seger,"It's a triple sided, tried to ride it
Looked inside it, I can't find it
Living in a perfect world

I touched the rocks, I touched the stones
It's the little things that break these bones
Living in this perfect world

When I can't hide
But even if I tried
I can't lie to you
Just to make you feel better
Oh oh baby, no no, I can't

Oh, my recent past has moved so fast
Couldn't keep up, fell on my ass
Living in this wind up world

Sick and tired, my card's expired
Why on earth did I get so wired?
Living in a perfect world

When I can't hide
But even if I tried
And I can't lie to you
To make you feel better

Just run quick, find a car
No location, just drive it far
I said, run quick, find a car
No location, just drive it far

Drive it far, drive it far, drive it far
Drive so far away, oh drive

And I can't lie, oh no
No matter how I try
I can't lie to you
Just to make you feel better, baby

I can't lie

i can't make you love me,bonnie raitt,"Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies

Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel somethin' it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't

I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holdin' me
Mornin' will come, and I'll do what's right
Just give me till then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel somethin' it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't

Ain't no use in you tryin', baby"
i can't stand it,the specials,"When I woke up this morning alone in my bed
In a cold room with damp sheets and a pain in my head
I saw you last night and you drove me insane
Why must you hurt me again and again?

I've had enough
If I don't come back for more that's tough
'Cos I can't stand it, the way you've planned it
No I can't stand it any longer

Sometimes I get so I tired, I can't get no sleep
I'm so drunk, I can't stand up on my own two feet
I'm feeling so hungry, I don't want to eat
You make me so angry, I can't even speak

I'll stay at home where I can be alone
Because I just can't stand it
The way you've planned it
No I can't stand it any longer

Try not to cry as I lie in the rain
Feel like walking through walls just to get back home again
I saw you last night and I'll see you again
Maybe you're trying to drive me insane

I've had enough
If I don't come back for more that's tough
'Cos I can't take it any more

I'm going home where I can be alone
Because I just can't stand it, no I can't stand it
No I can't stand it any longer

Goodnight Terry
Goodnight Rhoda"
i can't stop loving you,keith urban,"You said you needed your space
I wasn't where you wanted to be
I didn't stand in your way
I only want you to be happy
And, so, how surprised am I to see you here tonight?
Oh, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
Sometimes in our life
We get to where we wonder if
The long road that we're on
Is headin' in the same direction
Well, when it comes to you and me
We're right where I know we should be
Oh, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
Sometimes it's like we're deep in nothing but love
The slightest thing can grow so foolishly
Remind me, please
Oh, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
You don't gotta say you're sorry, baby
Oh, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
And I won't say I told you so
But I told you so
Should've known better than to leave me, baby"
i choose you,tears for fears,"I knew all this was coming
Ain't that odd
Some things come out of nothing
As with God
Not my intention to amuse
Or confuse

I've been down to the kitchen
Played my part
Mapped out all contradictions
Of the heart
Then someone came and stole my shoes
A situation I tried to diffuse

Long way back clouds were forming
If by choice
Some things come as a warning
Hear their voice
I wish that I could change its hue
Paint it blue
But when I think what I could lose
All other options disappear from view

When I Choose
I Choose You
I Choose You"
i didn't know what time it was,nnenna freelon,"didn't know what time it was,
Then I met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what day it was,
You held my hand.
Warm like the month of May it was,
And I'll say it was grand.
Grand to be alive, to be young,
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.
I didn't know what year it was,
Life was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,
And I know what time it is now.

I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,
And I know what time it is now."
i don't believe you,p!nk,"I don't mind it
I don't mind at all
It's like you're the swing set
And I'm the kid that falls
It's like the way we fight
The times I've cried
We come to blows
And every night
The passion's there
So it's got to be right
Right?

No, I don't believe you
When you say don't come around here no more
I won't remind you
You said we wouldn't be apart
No, I don't believe you
When you say you don't need me anymore
So don't pretend to
Not love me at all

I don't mind it
I still don't mind at all
It's like one of those bad dreams
When you can't wake up
It looks like you've given up
You've had enough
But I want more
No, I won't stop
'Cause I just know
You'll come around
Right?

No, I don't believe you
When you say don't come around here no more
I won't remind you
You said we wouldn't be apart
No, I don't believe you
When you say you don't need me anymore
So don't pretend to
Not love me at all

Just don't stand there and watch me fall
'Cause I, 'cause I still don't mind at all

It's like the way we fight
The times I've cried
We come to blows
And every night
The passion's there
So it's got to be right
Right?

No, I don't believe you
When you say don't come around here no more
I won't remind you
You said we wouldn't be apart

i don't care,brides of destruction,"Well you're all spaced out like a UFO
You're a semi hemi baby but your motor's blown

Drop you like a hand grenade
Murder city devil never on the level
Kill you with my serenade
[Chorus]
I don't care what I gotta do to love you
I don't need, need you to love me too
I don't care what I gotta do to love you
I don't need, need you to love me too
Kickin' out the jams like the ""MC5""
You're a nuclear bomb in a cold nosedive
Strung out electric sippin' antiseptic
Drop you like a hand grenade
Murder city devil never on the level
Kill you with my serenade
[Chorus: x2]"
i don't know,chelonis r. jones,"I never thought i'd get to this point in my life
Emotions wrung like a towel -vows mangled and knifed
...it's not the point that you're leaving
...or that you've found somebody new

-It's when i asked if our love was gone
You stuttered with a glare, saying...

I don't know
I don't know if love will somehow return
I don't know
If you walk out that door, the passion would burn
I don't know

...and as the train plowed through the rain
You fell to your knees and you cried
...but YOU were the one with a change of heart
-Didn't matter how hard i tried

I would' ve DIED for this love -now i got to be strong
It killed me when you said: you felt is was right

. . . BUT YOU COULD BE WRONG!?!"
i don't wanna miss a thing,pomplamoose,"I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleepin'
While you're far away and dreamin'
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Every moment spent with you
Is a moment I treasure

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Don't wanna miss a thing

Layin' close to you
Feeling your heart beating
And I'm wonderin' what you're dreamin'
Wonderin' if it's me you're seein'
So I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
Every moment spent with you
Is a moment I treasurer

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
I just wanna stay with you
Right here with you, just like this
I just wanna hold you close
Feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing"
i don't want to hear it anymore,scott walker,"In my neighbourhood
Where folks don't live so good now
The rooms are small
Most the buildings made of wood
I hear the neighbours talkin' about you and me
Yes, I've heard most every word
'Cause the talkin's loud
And the walls are much too thin

She don't really love him
Oh, that's what I heard them say
She sure wasn't thinkin' of him today
I saw her in the courtyard
Say that girl in room one forty nine
Talkin' to a boy I've never seen before
And standin' there together
Don't you know they looked so fine

No, I don't want to hear it anymore
I don't want to hear it anymore
'Cause the talk just never ends
And the heartache soon begins
The talk is so loud
And the walls, they're much too thin

Lord, ain't it sad
Said the woman cross the hall
That when a nice boy like that falls in love
Hey, it's just too bad that he had to go and fall
For a girl who doesn't care for him at all

No, I don't wanna hear it anymore
I don't wanna hear it anymore
'Cause the talk just never ends
And the heartache soon begins
Oh, they talk so loud
And the walls are much too thin

Whoa, I wish they wouldn't talk so loud
And expose my heartache to the crowd
These walls around me are so thin
Sometimes I think they're movin' in"
i don't want to talk about it,everything but the girl,"I can tell by your eyes
That you've prob'bly been cryin' forever,
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothin' to you
They're a mirror.
I don't want to talk about it
How you broke my heart.
If I stay here just a little bit longer,
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
If I stand all alone
Will the shadow hide the color of my heart
Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothin' to you
They're a mirror
I don't want to talk about it, how you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
This ol' heart.
If I stay here just a little bit longer,
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
My heart, whoa, heart."

i feel alright,zornik,"I open the door
See her baby blue eyes
Filled with a spark
She's wearing her dress and
All I can see is gold

And I see her
I call her

Is hidden from everybody
Except the both of us

It was a good life
You were the king of your mind
Oh so exciting
To be a little child again
I feel alright
Ta da da da dam ta da dam
I feel alright
Ta da da da dam ta da dam

And there she is playing
And laughing and singing out loud
And as I look at her
I think am I getting older

It was a good life

So I flew further down inside your opened mouth

Down your throat, I tickled around
And then you cough me out, oh yeah, you cough me out
I hid behind the curtains 'til you fell asleep again
I just hope you understand, I just wanna be your friend

Out on the street, inside a rubbish bin
Or a garbage, can depends on where you live
Oh, I live nowhere, now I'm a fly
I fly around, I-I-I fly around

And you will see me, hanging around
Outside your flat, inside your car
Behind the chair, well, everywhere
I'll be everywhere you are just to let you know
I've been watching you around, you really oughta know

I fly around, I-I-I fly around
I fly around, I-I-I fly around
I fly around, I-I-I fly around
I fly around, I-I-I fly around

I fly around ('round, 'round)
I, I fly around ('round, 'round)
I, I fly around ('round, 'round)
I fly around, I fly around ('round, 'round)

Last night, I turned into a fly
I got through your window, and I landed in your eye
You were sleeping, you didn't mind
So I flew further down inside your opened mouth

Down your throat, I tickled around
And then you cough me out, oh yeah, you cough me out
I hid behind the curtains 'til you fell asleep again
I just hope you understand, I just wanna be your friend"
i forgot,lionel richie,"Well honey here I am
I'm standing here all alone
Trying to get back to you
I know I did you wrong
By walking away
But now I need to tell you
I know now
What we had was a good thing
I know now
How much I'm lost
Girl without you
Without you

I Forgot it was your love
That captured my mind
I Forgot it was your dreams
That turned my life around
I Forgot it was your world
I wanted to see
I Forgot it was my wish
To make it you and me

Tell me what do I do
I'm going out of my head
I want and I'm missing you
I can't believe where I am
What have I done to myself
Girl I didn't mean to hurt us
I see now
That your love was all I needed
I see now
How much I was wrong
So forgive me, so forgive me
Forgive me

I Forgot it was your love
That captured my mind
I Forgot it was your dreams
That turned my life around
I Forgot it was your world
I wanted to see
I Forgot it was my wish
To make it you and me

Tell me what do I do
I'm going out of my head
I'm wanting and missing you
I can't believe where I am
What have I done to myself
I really didn't mean to hurt us
I see now I didn't have to play the game
That I was playing
I see now
That I was wrong so wrong
Can you hear me
Please forgive me

I Forgot it was your love
That captured my mind
I Forgot it was your dreams
That turned my life around
I Forgot it was your world
I wanted to see

I Forgot about you
I Forgot about me
I Forgot about all the things we wanted together
I Forgot about the dreams
Oh how much I love you babe
I Forgot..."
i gave you,bonnie 'prince' billy & matt sweeney,"I gave you a child, and you didn't want it
Thats the most that I have to give.
I gave you a house, and you didn't haunt it
Now where am I supposed to live.
I gave you a tree and you did not embrace it
I gave you a nightmare and you didn't chase it
I'd give you a dream and you'd only wake from it
Now I'll never go to sleep again.
I'd give you a treasure and you'd only take from it
Look at the hole where jewelry had been
Baby oh baby

Why must you escape from it
This love that we once called our friend.
(hoo ooo, ooo. hoo ooo ooo...)

I gave you my body and you ate aplenty
I gave you ten lives and you wasted twenty.
Now I'm standing empty, helpless and bare, without a morsel left of me to give
And you, you have vanished, into the air
The air in which I must live"
i go to work,blaze ya dead homie,"I'm the dead body creepin' through the streets on the East side
Took about three shots, victim of a homicide
Do a drive by in a second
Leave ya' all bloody an' tattered, lying on the pavement
Nothing can save ya, when I'm in a homicidal rage
Nut up, and then start unloading the 12 gauge
Sawed off pump in your ass, bitch
Say your prayers, bitch
Cause your headed to the casket
Then to the graveyard
A lil advice, never perpetrate and act hard
'Cause when you are dead, muthafucka, ain't shit to lose
Still gettin' my hustle on, and payin helly dues
Ain't got shit to prove to you marks and you bustas
Always stay strapped, 'cause you know I cain't trust ya'
Lights out, before I put ya in the dirt
It's Ya Dead Homie, Blaze
Bitch, I go to work

I go to work in my neighborhood
Puffin' on blunts, baggin' up yag and always up to no good
'Cause I'm a gansta, been to the grave and back
So, stop on my corner, and get your fuckin' car jacked
'Cause I don't play like my homies always say
We runnin' with the hatchet Psychopathic ay yay
E'eryday, Ya Homie Blaze, is on the streets
Bouncin' downtown, brandishing heat
Until just the other day when I was walkin' on my own
A sucka' tried to hit me for my stack and my cell phone
Tried to play me, G, till he got a peek of my pitch black eyes
Right before I shattered his teeth, and broke his jaw
Then watched him fall, lifeless
You should have seen his face, it was priceless
Just another lesson hoe, with disgression hoe
'Cause through the streets I lurk, I go to work

I go to work e'eryday
Baggin' up yay
Clockin' major chedda, loke
I'm all about my paper roll

I'm all about my paper roll
I go to work on the East side, jackin' sucka bitches rides
Doin' hella drive-bys just another homicide

Now I'm rollin' in the jacked up bucket
Bumpin' Twiztid, puffin herb, like fuck it
Make a left on the one way, that's when the boys in blue
Got behind me with they lights and sirens
Thirty seconds of silence, then I unloaded the clip
Pumpin' on pigs wit' the hollow point tips
So don't trip, I still gots to get my grip
Rollin' down the street, leavin' em bleedin' by the scene
Then a right, left, then a right, to a chop shop
Sold the bucket and a rock
To a smoked out bitch in a '92 Ranger
That's the way it is in the life of a gangsta
Or a hustla, quick to dust ya'
I could lose an arm, and still murder 40 of ya
Watch ya' back, when Blaze get his smirk on
You could be the next muthafucka' I go to work on

I go to work e'eryday
Baggin up yay
Clockin' major chedda, loke
I'm all about my paper roll
I go to work on the East side jackin' sucka' bitches rides
Doin' hella drive-bys, just another homicide

I got a Woman
I got a Woman
I got a Woman

Dans l'Arabie des trois midis
Des tours aux fronts de caïmans
Dans l'Arabie de ta peau neuve
Et des turbans de rêve noir

Le feu tinte dans les cloches
Douce est la parole de l'eau
Sous la clé des nuits légères
Enchaînées au coeur des filles

Le feu lèche les miroirs
Les museaux des endormies
Brûlent sous le regard fendu
Dans l'orange du matin"
i got it bad and that ain't good,julie london,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

He don't love me like I love him
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
Yes I've got it bad
And that ain't good"
i have nothing,noah and the whale,"Well i have nothing
I have no one
And i've been so quickly set free
And i love nothing
I love no one
Are words that you wisper in my mind
To someone i don't know
To someone i don't know
To someone i

So walk with me
On this new spring morning
I'll walk you til your fears are numb
I'm a new baby weeping
And the flower your keeping
That without love with wilt and die

I need your light in my life
Need your light in my life
Need your light
So come back to me my darling
Come back to me my darling
I'd do anything to be at your side
I'd be anyone to be at your side

I need your light in my life"

It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
I can hear them whisper as we pass by (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
It's a bad sign, bad sign (I, I)
Something happens when everybody finds out (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
See the vulture circling dark clouds (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
It could burn out (I, I)
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)

Baby, I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time, not this time (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I, I, I)

Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places

i know,barenaked ladies,"I know why I like you
It's 'cause of your clothing and your haircut
And 'cause you're racist
I have a match; your face,
My asking your questions you can't answer
You want to box me?

Our world works in a weird way
I've heard them say a man with a beard may
Frighten children or dogs but a moustache scares me more

I know why you bite me
It's cause of your instincts and your canines
And 'cause I kicked you
I have a bone to pick;
Please go on the paper, and fetch me my slippers
And stop meowing

Man's best friend wags his tail and
Bares his teeth to the man with the mail and
Though he's frightened of thunder he never goes to war

Tell me what's the circumstance of circumcision?
And what goes in my daughter's pants is whose decision?
I've seen the facts of inter-race realtions,
Of see-though slacks, of cyber-masturbation;
If a hundred monkeys each could get their own show,
Perhaps one day a chimp might say
""You have faith, you just need to use it, sayth the Lord""

I know why I like you
It's 'cause of your sandals and your supper
And 'cause you're Jesus
I have a match; your Dad, my dad has
Your picture right next to your mother's,
And one of Charo

They hold hands up in heaven
And they say that their son's name is Kevin
But I read in a book somewhere that his name is Jack"

Of all the places that I've left behind
The broken windows where the wind blows through
Empty shells of houses that have turned to ruin

Oh, oh, we're so young
We didn't realise just what we'd done
Oh, we were too young

And I remember you
You were the backyard boy
Hiding in the wreckage of broken dreams
Standing by the railway line, standing

Oh, oh, we're so young
We didn't realise just what we'd done
Oh, we were too young

Oh, oh, we're so young
We didn't realise just what we'd done
Oh, we were too young

And all the sweetness has been taken out of this place
So many memories are knocked down or replaced
And I can't stand to see the shifting time
Taking me further, leaving you behind

Oh, oh, we're so young
We didn't realise just what we'd done
Oh, we were too young

Your head around the door
'Cause mine stopped working

I was stood in the stairs
And time stopped moving
I want you here tonight
I want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
Oh, and you're here and I want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down
I remember it well
Taxied out of a storm
To watch you perform
And my ships were sailing
I remember it well
I was stood in your line
And your mouth, your mouth, your mind
I want you here tonight
I want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
Oh, and you're here and I want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down
Except you my love.
Except you my love
Come all ye lost
Dive into moss
I hope that my sanity covers the cost
To remove the stain of my love
Paper machÃ©
Come all ye reborn
Blow off my horn
I'm driving real hard
This is love, this is porn
God will forgive me
But I, I whip myself with scorn, scorn
I want to hear what you have to say about me
Hear if you're gonna live without me
I want to hear what you want
I remember December
And I want to hear what you have to say about me
Hear if you're gonna live without me
I want to hear what you want
What the hell do you want?"
i saw her standing there,daniel johnston,"Well she was just
Well she was just 17
And you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there
Well she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
When I saw her standing there
Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Well we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there
Well she was just 17
And I know what you mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another

i see a darkness,will oldham,"Well, you are my friend
And can you see?

Many times we've been out drinking
And many times we've shared our thoughts
But did you ever, ever notice
The kind of thoughts I got?

'Cause you know I have a love
For everyone I know
And you've seen I have this drive
To live I won't let go

But could you see it's opposition
Come rising up sometimes
Seen it's dreadful and position
Come blacking in my mind

And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
That I see a darkness
That I see a darkness
Did you know how much I love you
Is a hope that somehow you
Would save me from this darkness?

I hope that someday, buddy
We have got peace in our lives
Together or apart
Alone or with our wives
Then we'll stop our whoring
And pull the smiles inside
And light it up forever
And never go to sleep
My best unbeaten brother
This isn't all I see

No, I see a darkness
No, I see a darkness
Oh, no, I see a darkness
Oh, no, I see a darkness
Did you know how much I love you?
Is a hope that somehow you
Would save me from this darkness?"

Without you I'm useless
I'm bothered, you don't even notice
So how about you reach up
You realize, you see it
Come on, you really love this

You cry out loud when you're reckless in the dark
You like the way it feels good
You love the way I make you forget
You turn me on whenever you're around
You like the way you feel it
I love the way I make you forget

You seem like you're unstoppable now
You take love, and keep it all somehow
It feels like all I need is your help
I'm fading, alone all by myself
You say that I'm stupid
Without you I'm useless
I'm bothered, you don't even notice
So how about you reach up
You realize, you see it
Come on, you really love this

You cry out loud when you're reckless in the dark
You like the way it feels good
You love the way I make you forget
You turn me on, whenever you're around
You like the way you feel it
I love the way I make you forget"
i should have known better,the beach boys,"I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do (faster)
Whoa, oh, I should have realized what a kiss could be
That this could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too, you love me too, you love me too

(Great, now, ""Tell Me Why""
How does that go? That's my favorite Beatles song)"
i still believe,mariah carey,"You look in my eyes and I get emotional, inside
I know it's crazy but, you still can touch my heart
And after all this time., you think that I, wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing and nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me will find ourselves In love again

Each day of my life, I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I, I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope, left in my grasp, I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning, to have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby
I still believe that we can be together
No, no, no ...
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

I still believe
Someday you and me, will find ourselves in love again
(Oh, baby, yeah, yeah)
I had a dream
You and me, will find ourselves in love again

(I still believe) oh, baby, I do
(Someday you and me) just give me one more try
In love again
(I had a dream) I miss your love
(Someday you and me)
Will find ourselves In love again

(I still believe)
(Someday you and me) will find ourselves in love again"
i surrender,steps,"Maybe I wanted to be free
I wanted time to be me
I tried to fly so high
But something's changed
Inside of my heart
And now there's the sweetest pain
Oh I can't explain
It's time I asked
What am I running from and to?

Ooh, I surrender baby
I need your love to save me
Now I know that I was wrong
I'm coming back 'cos love is strong
Yeah I surrender baby
So stop my heart from breaking
It's crazy but now that we're through
The only thing I want is you
So surrender too

Maybe we're only halves alone
And it's together we are whole
And now I've thought it through
Well it all works out it's you I love
Every single day I picture your face
But it's not enough
And I can't fight the truth no more

Ooh, I surrender baby
I need your love to save me
Now I know that I was wrong
I'm comin' back 'cos love is strong
Yeah I surrender baby
So stop my heart from breaking
It's crazy but now that we're through
The only thing I want is you
So surrender too

Now I know what love is worth
And it's too much to lose
And I know there's nothin' else
Nothin' else but you
So surrender too

Ooh, I surrender baby
I need your love to save me
Now I know that I was wrong
I'm comin' back 'cos love is strong
Yeah I surrender baby
So stop my heart from breaking
It's crazy but now that we're through

i think i love you,partridge family,"Baaa, ba ba ba
Baba, ba ba ba
Baaa, ba ba ba

I'm sleeping
And right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up
From something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane, I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed
Screaming out the words I dread
""I think I love you!""
(I think I love you)

This morning
I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with
And so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself
And never talk about it
And didn't I go and shout it
When you walked into my room
""I think I love you!""
(I think I love you)

I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of?
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for

I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
That I've never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I've got so much to think about
Hey!

I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of?
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for

I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
I never felt this way

Believe me
You really don't have to worry
I only want to make you happy
And if you say ""Hey, go away"", I will
But I think better still
I better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case?
Let me ask you to your face

Do you think you love me?
I think I love you!
I think I love you!
I think I love you
I think I love you!
I think I love you!
I think I love you!
I think I love you
I think I love you!
I think I love you"
i think of you,rodriguez,"Just a song we shared, I'll hear
Brings memories back when you were here
Of your smile, your easy laughter
Of your kiss, those moments after
I think of you,
And think of you
And think of you.
Of the dreams, we dreamt together
Of the love we vowed would never
Melt like snowflakes in the sun
My days now end as they begun
With thoughts of you,
And I think of you
And think of you.
Down the streets I walked with you
Seeing others doing things we do
Now these thoughts are haunting me
Of how complete I used to be
And in these times that we're apart
I'll hear this song that breaks my heart
And think of you
And I think of you
And think of you
And think of you
And I do"
i thought,nitzer ebb,"Lost you under my bed
Hid and over your head
Moved away from our town
Ask me what has been found

But don't tell me nothing
Won't tell you nothing
I know there's something out there
Someone who I can take care
Don't tell me
Don't tell me

Stars and moon are up late
Sun is sealing their fate
Time to let out a sigh
Sweet, sweet child will always ask why

So don't tell her nothing
She won't tell you anything
She knows that something's out there
Someone that she can take care
Don't tell her
Don't tell her

I thought you knew, I thought
I thought you knew, I thought
I thought you knew
I thought you knew
I thought you knew, I thought
I thought you knew, I thought
I thought you knew

I touch myself
Oh, I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no

You're the one who makes me come runnin'
You're the sun who makes me shine
When you're around, I'm always laughin'
I want to make you mine

I close my eyes
And see you before me

A fool could see

i wanna be with you,pretty boy floyd,"As I was walking out of class
The other day at school
I saw you
Don't think I've ever seen you
'Round here before
You must be new
What's your name? Where are you from?
Our conversation's just begun
Maybe we can talk more after school
I know that we just met but maybe
You'd like to let me
Go out with you
I want to be with you, I want to be with you
I want to be with you, I want to be with you
I want to be with you, I want to be with you
And only you
I got your number from a friend
So I called
To talk to you
I don't live too far
We could walk down to the park
If you got nothing else to do
Being that you're new in town
You probably want to look around
But I could tell you, before you do
Cause you really mean a lot to me
And you don't have to look no more
Cause I've found the girl I'm looking for
I want to be with you, I want to be with you
I want to be with you, I want to be with you
I want to be with you, I want to be with you
It's only you, yeah
If I could have any girl in school
I wouldn't take but one
The only girl I want is you
If I could do anything
Anything I wanted to
It wouldn't be too hard to choose
I want to be with you, I want to be with you
I want to be with you, I want to be with you
I want to be with you, I want to be with you
I want to be with you"
i wanna die,adam green,"I wanna chose to die
And be buried with a rubix cube
And sleep inside the big blue buildings
While the sweet disease drives through

There's a bakery in the night sky
I wanna die because the government lied

She was a man with herpes
Floating in a yellow stream
Running through the windows backwards
Kissing all the buildings clean

You know his appetite for hardcore taste
And orgiastic party games

She woke up in the highway
With arrows pointing at her face
Later that day in gym class
She ate a mouth full of anthrax
Go to sleep"
i wanna go,britney spears,"Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the wa-a-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt

Woah-oh-oh

Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the bla-blanket
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the wa-a-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt

i want love (studio mix),akira yamaoka,"All right, let's do this

One, two, three, (four)

I want a cup that overflows with love
Although it's not enough to fill my heart
I want a barrel full of love
Although I know it's not enough to fill my heart

I want a river full of love
But then I know the holes will still remain
I need an ocean full of love
Although I know the holes will still remain

And this swiss-cheese heart knows
Only kindness can fill its holes
And love can dry my tears
As pain disappears

I need a miracle and not someone's charity
One drop of love from him
And my heart's in ecstasy
The high that he's sending me
Is most likely ending me
I need a miracle and not someone's charity now

Fill up my heart with love
Oh, you'd be amazed at how little I need from him
To feel complete here and now
Stirring within me
Are these feelings I can't ignore
I need a miracle and that's what I'm hoping for

I need a miracle and not someone's charity
One drop of love from him
And my heart's in ecstasy
The high that he's sending me
Is most likely ending me
I need a miracle and not someone's charity now
Oh, baby

Anybody's love but his will never fill this space within me

Now doctor, give me what I need to free my heart from misery"

I need to spend some money and it just won't wait
Take me to the dance and hold me tight

There's a silver band just marching up and down
And the big boys are all spoiling for a fight

Meet me at the station don't be late

Stay with me, tell me if it shows

But I wish it would rain(Oh how I wish that it would rain) 'Cause so badly I wanna go outside (such a lovely day)But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
I gotta cry 'cause cryin' is such a pain, oh yeah
People, this hurt I feel inside words can never explain
I just wish it would rain(Oh how I wish that it would rain)Rain, rain, rain(Oh how I wish that it would rain) Day in, day out, my tear-stained face is pressed againstthe window pane
I search the skies desperately for rain'Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know
That I'm cryin', cryin' when I go outside
To the world outside, my tears I refuse to explain
Oh, I wish it would rain(Oh how I wish that it would rain) Let it rain, let it rain
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes..."
i wish,carl thomas,"It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me

Her eyes said it all

Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
But she got love from me

But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad for sure
Because she wants to be with me

But she cannot be with me

She chose to stay at home
So they could be a family
For the children but what about me?

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
And she got love from me
And she still belongs to someone else

Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22, either way it hurts
Someone that you lose

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She's got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

And I, and I
Even though I love her so

She's got love from me

But she still belongs to someone else

I wish, I wish I never met her at all

I wouldn't hurt so much inside"
i won't give up,jason mraz,"When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well, there's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

And in the end you're still my friend, at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend, without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got and what I'm not
And who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up

Well I won't give up on us (no, I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough, he knows (I am tough, I am loved)
We got a lot to learn (we are alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up"
i won't hurt you,the west coast pop art experimental band,"I have lost all my pride
I have been to paradise
And out the other side
With no one to guide me
Torn apart by a firey wheel inside me

I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you

An untouched diamond
That's golden and brilliant
Without illumination
Your mouth, a constellation
The stars are in your eyes
I'll take a spaceship and try and go and find you

I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you

My pale blue star
My rainbow, how good it is
To know you're like me
Strike me with your lightning
Bring me down and bury me with ashes

i won't let you down,alex clare,"Just another grey autumn day
You're the sunshine trying to break through
No I never imagined that my path would lead to you
A look in your eyes as they met mine
Seem to say we're the same
In so many ways
Though we're worlds apart
I will promise you

No I won't let you down

There are so many reasons to keep us apart
But it won't stop me losing
My mind or my heart
What would I give
To touch your hand
Oh just feel your skin
I'd breathe you in
Could this ever be
You'll be next to me

No I won't let you down
No I won't let you down

I know myself so well
But I've never been here before
You're just out of my reach
But I will be here
Of that you can be sure
Can be sure

It's another grey autumn day
You're the sunshine trying to break through
I can only imagine that I'm walking with you
I realise if you were mine
We may fall apart
Oh you'd have my heart
There's too many things between you and me

No I won't let you down
No I won't let you down
No I won't I won't let you down

Another set up for the fall
Does anybody hear him?

But everyone will decide

I'm not afraid of the price I pay
I won't lie down as you walk away
I'm not afraid of the price I pay
I won't lie down as you walk away

I'm sure you must have seen him
I know you must have heard it all
I know you used to be him
Did anybody care at all?

i wonder,king geedorah,"That's right I got problems and personal issues
Stories that'll make ya, eyes tear and wet tissue
It's true, I'm Madd like the Rapper
I'm so upset I gotta put it up in my rap before I snapper
After the things I've seen from Atlanta to Queens
To the mean streets of Brooklyn when I was a teen
Back and forth to the Islands, scream when I left
But adapted, and still my dreams haven't left
I only hung with the crack kids we not the best
Me and the ruffest ruffnecks went chest to chest
Now my best friend's locked up north I won't rest
'Til I let him live his dream threw me and I confess
That even though both our hearts was dark his was darker
Best believe when shit got spark he was the sparker
And when the block got hot he was the fire starter
And if I had beef my nigga Roger was a martyr
I wonder, how certain people come in my life
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder, why sometimes things just don't go right
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey
I wonder, how certain people come in my life
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey
Yo, you one of the most important people in my life
They called you Dice but I called you cousin
We was buggin' 'cause I figured that we both had something in common
You loved to chat reggae music and I loved rhymin'
But still they ain't call you Dice for nuttin'
I seen you shoot with the wiliest cats and leave them with nothing
Somethin' must have pleased that bluffer in you
To make you wanna take dough from those tougher than you
Threw out school we made money together
When you was on the floor shootin', I was the side better
And yo we cleaned out them cats and took the scraps
But you wasn't a ruff cat and cats knew that
I knew eventually them thugs would try to hurt you
If I was there, I'd never let nobody hurt you, it's hurtful
I knew they wouldn't let you take the money and run
That's why I shoulda came when you told me to come
I wonder, how certain people come in my life
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey
I wonder, how certain things don't go right
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey
Yo, it was June sixth '96, graduation night
Made it threw the school swish shootin' dice gettin' in fights
I even sparked a riot, 'til the school got quiet
And dismiss just got tired of usin' my fists
We had some shit like knife pipes bottles and sticks
Can't forget them 380's, nine's and 22's
Best believe, many dudes was paid in my crew
We made a name for ourselves boy I've seen some drama
Seems my momma never dreamed she'd go threw so much trauma
Comma, pause you ask about cops and laws
Well that shit don't exist when you black and poor
So we broke 'em, but at that night my heart got broken
Choken on the weed smoke drinkin' rum and gettin' open
Not to mention, never a big drinker I'm a thinker
But I'm thinkin' hey dis my night, pass me more liquor
Fight breaks out, I'm just too nice to get in it
But my brother got stabbed and I missed it
Word up, its crazy
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey
(Wonder)
I wonder, why sometimes things just don't go right
I wonder, why certain people come in my life
I wonder, yeah
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

Your life"
i'd die without you,wayne wonder,"Is it my turn to wish you were lying here.
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping.
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world.
Or even imagine your emotions. Tell myself anything
Is it my turn to hold you by your hands.
Tell you I love you and you not hear me
Is it my turn to totally understand.
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing

If I have to give away
The feeling that I feel.
If I have to sacrifice
Oh, whatever babe, whatever baby.
If I have to take apart
All that I am
Is there anything that I would not do,
'Cause inside I'd die without you
Yeah baby
'Cause inside I'd die without you
'Cause inside I'd die without you

Oh, I apologize for all the things I've done.
But now I'm underwater and I'm drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry.
Isn't it amazing how some things completely turn around
So take every little piece of my heart
Yeah, take every little piece of my soul
Yeah, take every little bitty piece of my mind
'Cause if you're gone inside
I'd die without you"
i'll be gone,papas fritas,"Don't lie when I ask how you're feeling
I can read your mind
Second thoughts have come across
So clear in your eyes

Outside, in the car, in the kitchen
There's nothing left to say
Eternity gets a little shorter everyday

And for a while
We couldn't pretend
But no denial
Could start things over again

The road goes on forever
The days fade into the night
We're not walking together
And now I'm feeling alright

Forget all the things that I told you
Whispers in the dark, it's all in vain
'Cause everything we had just fell apart

Three weeks seems so long
When there's nothing to do
Lookin' up at the sky and it's finally blue
High time I threw away
That shoebox full of thoughts of you

Try not to rewind to the first time
Like it's sometime yesterday
Draw the blinds
Let the sunshine find a way

The road goes on forever
The days fade into the night
We're not walking together
And now I'm feeling alright

So the party's over
It's time to move it along
So don't look over your shoulder
'Cause I'll already be gone

And for a while
We couldn't pretend
But no denial
Could start things over again

And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone"

I can hear a heartbeat

I look at your lips
I know how soft they can be
Did they know what they wanted
The times they kissed me?

And your hands
I held in mine
Now they're reposing on the pillow
Will they ever miss me sometime?

I'll remember you
You will be there in my heart
I'll remember you

I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling for a stranger

Did he see me standing there?
Did he see me standing there?
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling for a stranger

No matter how lost I feel
No matter how cross I feel
He'll see that I'm special
Somebody out of the ordinary

I watch him from my window
As he walks down to his car below
Does he know that I exist?
One smile, one kiss

That thing I did was wrong
Now I'm free about crying alone
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling for a stranger

If only I could meet him
He'd understand my feelings
Call his number, call his number
I stumble, words won't come out

The time is right for love tonight

Please see inside my dreams of you)"

Worryin' what people say
Feelin' like I won't fit in, but
I won't give up, no, I won't give in

We're looking for somethin' more
What you really looking for?
It's been with you since you were born

You only live once
I'm good with myself
I'm there for my friends
Until the very end

You only live once
I'm good with myself
I'm there for my friends
Until the very end

I wanna see another love revolution
Found a way to be a better person
If we come together like we should
We could all be good

I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
Livin' life just like I should
Wouldn't change it if I could
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good

Cause I'm in love
I'm in love
Perfection is under your skin
Well, your affection should be a sin

You tie, you tie, you tie, you tie me down
I love it so, I love it so, so I'll stick around
Take me

Darlin' I miss your sweet lips
Miss them so
Need to feel your mouth, need the touch
Darlin' where are you goin'?
And where have you been?
I'm gonna crawl to you closer
I lose control"
i'm in the mood for love,julie london,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Honey, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh, is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade
We put our hearts together
Now we are one
I'm not afraid

If there's a cloud above
And it must rain, well let it
But for tonight, forget it
I'm in the mood for love"
i'm into something good,earl-jean,"Woke up this mornin' feelin' fine
There's somethin' special on my mind
Last night I met a new girl in the neighbourhood, whoa yeah
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin')

She's the kind of girl who's not too shy
And I can tell I'm her kind of guy
She danced close to me like I hoped she would
(She danced with me like I hoped she would)
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin')

We only danced for a minute or two
But then she stuck close to me the whole night through
Can I be fallin' in love
She's everthing I've been dreamin' of
She's everthing I've been dreamin' of

I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could
(I asked to see her and she told me I could)
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin')
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin', ahh)

I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could

Somethin' tells me I'm into something good

Somethin' tells me I'm into something good
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin')
To something good, oh yeah, something good
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin')
To something good, something good, something good"
i'm into you,chet faker,"I got a feeling we are gonna win
Our bodies make it perfect
And your eyes can make me swim
Then again, everything seems new
I can barely hold my tongue

To say the least, I'm into you
And your eyes
Are saying more than we can talk
And warmer than our bedroom sport
And your thighs
Are kisses from the outside, girl, that's all I need

I'll take you down the other road
To breathe in something more
I'll find it harder to ignore
The things I want you for

I know you don't want a love you can't sing
The music was at the start
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do
The rhythm was all I needed to hear
A woman can treat my heart
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do

Is that your knee resting on mine?
Can you feel that?
If I move, I can

When I press an ear up to your breast
I can hear the rhythm start
It's hard to tell our beats apart
So I hope you're listening right now
'Cause I can barely hold my tongue

The shit we do could warm the sun
At night
Twisted in a melting fall and sleeping with the scratching claws
And your words
Let me know you're feeling me and seeing all the things I see

I'll take you down the other road
To breathe in something more
I'll find it harder to ignore
The things I want you for

I know you don't want a love you can't sing
The music was at the start
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do
The rhythm was all I needed to hear
A woman can treat my heart
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do

I know you don't want a love you can't sing
The music was at the start

i'm not that girl,kerry ellis,"Hands touch, eyes meet
Sudden silence, sudden heat
Hearts leap in a giddy whirl
He could be that boy
But I'm not that girl
I'm not that girl

Blithe smile, lithe limb
She who's winsome, she wins him
Gold hair with a gentle curl
That's the girl he chose
And heaven knows
I'm not that girl

Don't dream too far
Don't lose sight of who you are
Don't remember that rush of joy
He could be that boy
I'm not that girl

Every so often we long to steal
To the land of what might have been
But that doesn't soften the ache we feel
When reality sets back in

Don't wish, don't start
Wishing only wounds the heart
I wasn't born for the rose and the pearl
There's a girl I know
He loves her so
I'm not that girl

(I'm not that girl)

Don't dream too far
Don't lose sight of who you are
(I'm not that girl)
I won't wish, and I won't start
Wishing only wounds the heart
(I'm not that girl)

I won't dream, but I'm gonna pray
That maybe someday

I'll be that girl"
i'm so lonesome i could cry,cowboy junkies,"Hear the lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds to blue to fly
The midnight train is a-winding low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time keeps crawling by
The moon is gone behind the clouds
To hide his face and cry

Have you ever seen a robin weep
When leaves have turned to brown?
Like me, he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple haze
And yes I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry"
i'm sorry,red house painters,"Its cold here in the city
Always seems that way
I've been thinking about you almost everyday
Thinking about the good times
Thinking about the bad
Thinking about how bad it feels all alone again

I'm sorry for the ways things are in China
I'm sorry things aren't what they used to be
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
That you're not here with me

My friends all ask about you
I say you're doing fine
I expect to hear from you almost any time
They all know I'm lying
I can't sleep at night
They all know I'm dying deep down inside

I'm sorry for all the lies I told you
I'm sorry for the things I didn't say
But more than anything else I'm sorry for myself

I can't believe you went away
I'm sorry if I took some things for granted
I'm sorry for the chains I put on you
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself for living without you"
i'm still breathing,katy perry,"I leave the gas on, walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning, I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and running all the red lights
Did I get your attention
'Cause, I'm sending all the signs

That the clock is ticking and I'll be giving my two weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black you best prepare a speech
Say something funny, say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me

I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure, we're going down for sure
Already lost our grip, best abandon ship, oh

Maybe I was too pale, maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better, better luck in the sack
No formal education, I swore way too much
I swear you didn't care, 'cause, we were in love

So as I write this letter and shed my last tear
Know it's all for the better that we end this here
Let's close this chapter, say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me

I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure, we're going down for sure
Oh we've been diagnosed, so let's give up the ghost

'Cause, I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure, we're going down for sure
Already lost our grip, best abandon ship, oh

i'm still here,johnny rzeznik,"I am a question to the world
Not an answer to the earth
Or a moment that's held in your arms

And what do you think you'd ever say
I won't listen anyway
You don't know me
And I'll never be what you want

Me to be
And what
Do you think you'd understand
I'm boy, no, I'm a man
You can't take me
And throw me away
And how

Can you learn what's never shown
Yeah, you stand here on your own
They don't know me
'Cause I'm not here
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things I don't feel
Wanna hold on and feel I belong

And how can the world want me to change
They're the ones that stay the same
They don't know me
'Cause I'm not here
And you see the things they never see
All you wanted - I could be
Now you know me

And I'm not afraid
And I want to tell you who I am
Can you help me be a man

And how can the world want me to change
They're the ones that stay the same
They can't see me
But I'm still here
They can't tell me who to be

'Cause I'm not what they see
Yeah, the world is still sleepin' while I keep on dreaming for me
And their words are just whispers and lies that I'll never believe
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things I don't feel
Wanna hold on and feel I belong
And how can you say I'll never change
They're the ones that stay the same

i'm your man,jacob golden,"I lifted up the storm drain
And pushed my hands into the dirt
There's a secret here hidden somewhere
And the words repeated psalm like
'Cause that's my birthright

I wondered if I could get low enough
To the ground with my headphones on
And the fire ants biting at my hands
Don't worry, there's a master plan

I was bitten
By a sour frame of mind that day
And I didn't mean to treat you in a hurtful way
But my dreams had all expired
And my thoughts were static

I was looking
At my future in a box in the attic
Will you please, come see me?
We could form a new band
Does that sound like a recurring bad luck hand?

I'm a microphone, I'm a tambourine
I'm a record sleeve, I'm a melatron
I'm your man

I shall wear the impossible dream
In a tattoo on my arm for my friends to see
To remind me when my focus
Turns from love to depression
And I'll pray to George Harrison's reincarnation

It was after the Gold Rush spinning in my heart
And I thought we could invent a supernatural art
But the band went down in a fiery zeppelin

And I smashed my guitar at the gates of heaven
And the well in the Murakami book went dry
Mister, wind up bird, can you tell me why?

So I looked for the answer in Norwegian Wood
And the million little pieces of my childhood
The billion little pieces of my childhood

I'm a perfect rhyme, I'm a drum machine
I'm a radio, I'm a symphony
I'm your man"
i'm yours,the script,"You touch these tired eyes of mine
And map my face out line by line
And somehow growing old feels fine
I listen close for I'm not smart
You wrap your thoughts in works of art
And they're hanging on the walls of my heart
I may not have the softest touch
I may not say the words as such
And though I may not look like much
I'm yours
And though my edges may be rough
And never feel I'm quite enough
It may not seem like very much
But I'm yours
You healed these scars over time
Embraced my soul
You loved my mind
You're the only angel in my life
The day news came my best friend died
My knees went weak and you saw me cry
Say I'm still the soldier in your eyes
I may not have the softest touch
I may not say the words as such
And though I may not look like much
I'm yours
And though my edges may be rough
And never feel I'm quite enough
It may not seem like very much

And I've got you under my skin

I've tried so not to give in
You know I said to myself this affair ain't gonna go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well
That I've got you way under my skin

I would sacrifice anything come what might for the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night and repeats in my ear
Don't you know you fool you never can win
Use your mentality

Step up to reality
But each time I do just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you, you're under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything come what might for the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night

And repeats how it yells in these ears
Don't you know you fool, no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, wake up, step up to reality
But each time I do just the thought of you makes me stop just before I begin
Because I've got you under my skin
And I love you under my skin"
icarus,bastille,"Look who's digging their own grave
That is what they all say; you'll drink yourself to death
Look who makes their own bed, lies right down within it
And what will you have left?

Out on the front doorstep, drinking from a paper cup
You won't remember this
Living beyond your years, acting out all their fears
You feel it in your chest

Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus' life, it has only just begun
It's just begun...

Standing on the cliff face, highest fall you'll ever grace
It scares me half to death
Look out to the future, but it tells you nothing
So take another breath

Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus' life, it has only just begun
This is how it feels to take a fall
Icarus is flying towards an early grave

You put up your defences when you leave
You leave because you're certain
Of who you want to be

You're putting up your armour when you leave
And you leave because you're certain of who you want to be, oh

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus' life, it has only just begun
This is how it feels to take a fall
Icarus is flying towards an early grave

I can be the sauce you crave
I can spell what you can't say
Chocolate flavored love theme
Treat that treats you so mean
Covering your nights and days

Let me give you what you'd like
I can make you mouth run dry
Drink me like a liquor
C'mon and dip your dipper
Show me what you're here for, guy

I can give you what you want

Fantastic flavored fancies
Sick like Sid and Nancy
Wicked as a joy ride jaunt

iceland,the fall,"A plate steel object was fired
And I did not feel for my compatriots
Hated even the core of myself
Not a matter of ill-health
It was fear of weakness deep in core of myself
The fact attainment was out of

Mounting orations
The populations
To be humbled in Iceland
Sing of legend, sing of destruction
Witness the last of the god-men
Hear about Magnus Jonsson

Cast the runes against your own soul
There is not much more time to go
Work 15 hours for the good of the soul
And be humbled in Iceland

Sit in the gold room
Fall down flat in the Café Isle
Without a glance from the clientele
Good coffee black as well
Hair blond as hell

Cast the runes against your own soul
Roll up for the underpants show
And be humbled in Iceland

And the spawn of the volcano
Is thick and impatient
Like the people around it
See a green goblin redhead, redhead
Make a grab for the book of prayers
Do anything for a bit of attention
Get humbled in Iceland

What the goddamn fuck is it
That played the pipes of aluminum?
A Memorex for the Krakens
That induces this rough text

And casts the runes against the self-soul
And humbles in Iceland"
ice,the microphones,"The heat came down and breathing got clear
There was water in your hair
And the sun came out, we had to get back in
The fog burned off and finally i felt near
Sunlight made reflections on your skin
To the place i like to stay but the year went on and it got too cold to swim
So i stayed beneath as the water above me froze
From under the ice i saw you in warm clothes
And now i'm thawing out while the fire you made grows"
idaho,gregory alan isakov,"Down in the bardo
There was nothing to hold so we let it go
We were empty, we were hollow
Shined with everything we were living for
And you see your soul
Like some picture show
Across Idaho
We were running through the autumn leaves
A couple kids just wearing out our jeans, running
Mary she's our autumn queen
Watch her smoking cigarettes in the street
And down she goes
Cold she blows
Across Idaho
And there's lights up in the north
And I ain't wondering where you are
Yeah just lights up in the north
Now it's white as snow
Watch the evening glow
Across Idaho"

Just in time
Papa cried, baby cried
Said, your tears are like mine

From a friend on the phone
Didn't sound so good
The doctor gave him two weeks to live
I'd give him more if I could

You know that I would now
If only I could
You know that I would now
If only I could

Down the middle drops one more
Grain of sand
They say that
New life makes losing life easier to understand

Words are kind
They help ease the mind

One comes in

I hear you callin', if I didn't know any better
And I'd be in love with you

Didn't want to look in the eyes of the one
That I would be drawn to, I'm a moth lost in a fire
And I know this is just a customary fever
The moon is our deceiver that will leave you running blind

Your heart is pullin', if I didn't know any better
I'd be fallin' deeper and deeper, it's true
I hear you callin', if I didn't know any better

You were the one
Made me feel I could fly

And I love you
Whatever is waiting for me

Or what we're made of
Who knows if there's a plan or not
There is our love

Spinning unheard
In the dark of the sky

Between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing
To break up our happy home
Don't get so excited
When I come home
A little late at night
Cos we only act like children
When we argue fuss and fight

If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me

We've all got our
Own funny moods
I've got mine,
Woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
It should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together

There'll be nothing left in this world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space

But when I'm there I'm broke
She's tellin' me about the things that her girlfriend's got
What she ain't got
And she wants me to go out and get 'em for her
But girl, I can't be in two places at one time

If you think you're lonely now, huh
Wait until tonight, girl (if you think you're lonely now)
I'll be long gone (wait until tonight, girl)
And you'll never find another man who treat you right (if you think you're lonely now)
When I ain't there to rub your back (wait until tonight, girl)
Just remember I made it a known fact
And the skeletons come out of the closet
And chase you all around your room
And the memories sail 'round like a ghost
And dance around to a sad slow tune

If you think you're lonely now (if you think you're lonely now)

I'm feeling seasick again
The whole world could just dissolve
Into a glass of water
I've been good 'cause I know you don't want me to
Do you really want me to be blue as you?
It's her daylight that gets me through

We've been here before
Last time you scratched at my door
The moon was naked and cold
I was like a two-year-old
Who just wanted more

If you wear that velvet dress
If you wear that velvet dress
Tonight, the moon's drawn its curtains
It's a private show
No one else gonna know
I'm wanting

Sunlight, sunlight fills my room
It's sharp and it's clear
But nothing at all like the moon
It's okay
The struggle for things not to say
I never listened to you anyway
And I got my own hands to pray

But if you wear that velvet dress
If you wear that velvet dress
Tonight the moon is a mirror-ball
Light flickers from across the hall
Who'll catch the star when it falls"

As a matter of fact
That in the face of the days
Sometimes I don't know how to act
Neck so tense you could pull a wing with it
Eyes so raw you could see nothing in 'em
Dead negligent fours right out of his air holes
Caught with his one white lung
And his wing and his whole city
Cut for a scope just like playa
Called a dollar in old Oakland
Phone bill cost unreplicated gone half heart
Corinthian column taught with my raw arm
Caught left, caught right
Bill to the occupation
Like Bam
None of my my Lord and my pay rent to decide
And ban me
And my none with exaggerated arms never the neck
Hong Chong open to me

I'm devoted to a telling a detail

I'm awash in overall impressions

And playin for keeps, cause see, it's a thin red line
Between a nigga gettin his, and me gettin mine
And plus I'm a nigga with that feelin like it's my time
And anybody standin in the way of that is dyin
I bust nine, how many times I gotta warn you?
I ain't the one, be pushin buttons in the sight of my gun
I'm the real live version of the Corleone family
So I spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me
One wrong move, and I'mma have to leave you for the goons
Catch you slippin asleep in your bedroom and then
Get you Audi, now what the fuck was this dude thinkin?
You can cheat the rules of the streets, and not leave stinkin?
I can squeeze without blinkin, I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (ooh) I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta
I got a brick from a sucker that he wanted to move
But the whole while I'm cookin I'm like, ""Fuck this dude""
It's on, thirty-six zones of my own
Keep the money fo' myself and take the work back home
Call that nigga on the phone (ay) I just got knocked
And the cops was askin bout you, come get me hot
Never showed, so fuck him and the money that I owed
I got a get rich quick scheme, steppin on the dope
It's cold, but that's it, I'm on it like I want it
And twenty-eight cash and change, the whole game on it
That means I'm on my feet and I can front the homies D
Break 'em off a couple of C, and double up they fee
Takin over, shoot up they spot, make it hot
And when the cops dry it out, put my work on the block
And if they wanna ride for they corners we ride right with 'em
Dummy move, whole thing, the goon squad get 'em
I can squeeze without blinkin, I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (ooh) I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta
No mo' petty rock hustlin, I'm in for the run
And I'm fo'sho I'm gon' be murdered for this shit that I done
But I'mma die standin up cause I'm a stand up nigga
Fuck dyin like a bitch on my knees, I'm a killer
So don't nobody cry cause I was destined to get it
Just remember, I'm the one who took the dope game and flipped it
And pimped it, and destroyed everything in the way
Of me seein first motherfuckin light of the day
A trigger man, deadly as fuck with a loaded AK
Spot my enemy and kill him the American way
I turned a dream into reality, with a fuck you mentality
Silencin all these niggas in the neighborhood who challenged me
Family grievin from they loved one's mortality
He ain't got a reason to die then kill him, it's a tragedy
I can squeeze without blinkin, I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (ooh) I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta

I've missed you for so long
I can't believe you're gone
And you still live in me
I feel you in the wind
You guide me constantly
I never knew what it was to be alone, no
'Cause you were always there for me
You were always home waiting
But now I come home and I miss your face so
Smiling down on me
I close my eyes to see

And I know
You're a part of me and it's your song
That sets me free
I sing it while
I feel I can't hold on, I sing tonight
'Cause it comforts me

I carry the things that remind me of you
In loving memory of the one that was so true
You were as kind as you could be
And even though you're gone
You still mean the world to me
I never knew what it was to be alone, no
'Cause you were always there for me
You were always home waiting
But now I come home and it's not the same no
It feels empty and alone
I can't believe you're gone

And I know
You're a part of me and it's your song
That sets me free
I sing it while
I feel I can't hold on, I sing tonight
'Cause it comforts me

I'm glad he set you free from sorrow
But I'll still love you more tomorrow
And you'll be here with me still
All you did you did with feeling
And you always found a meaning
And you always will
And you always will
And you always will

And I know
You're a part of me and it's your song
That sets me free
I sing it while
I feel I can't hold on, I sing tonight

The ship comes into shore
You've been away to somewhere

Through the foreign ocean
Underneath the sea

The walls come tumbling down
We'll be forever calm
And you'll be here in my arms
I'll keep you away from harm

I thought about you twice just then
You get me every time
Keeps coming out of nowhere
It cannot be defined

Your colours are magnificent
From magenta to bright blue

The walls come tumbling down
We'll be forever calm
And you'll be here in my arms
I'll keep you away from harm

in my bed,amy winehouse,"Wish I could say it breaks my heart
Like you did in the beginning
It's not that we grew apart
A nightingale no longer singing

It's something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone, the sun comes up
You're still clinging to that notion

Everything is slowing down
River of no return
Recognize my every sound
There's nothing new to learn

You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing when we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
It's a different way from where I'm going

Oh, it's you again
Listen, this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my bed

I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did

Now it's not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right

Everything is slowing down
River of no return
You recognise my every sound
There's nothing new to learn

You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
It's a different way from where I'm going

in my life,johnny cash,"There are places I'll remember
All my life
Though some have changed
Some forever
Not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life
I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one
Compares with you
And these memories
Lose their meaning
When I think of love
As something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more

In my life
I love you more"

In my secret life

I saw you this morning
You were moving so fast
Can't seem to loosen my grip
On the past

And I miss you so much
There's no one in sight
And we're still making love
In my secret life
In my secret life

I smile when I'm angry
I cheat and I lie
I do what I have to do
To get by
But I know what is wrong
And I know what is right
And I'd die for the truth
In my secret life
In my secret life

Hold on, hold on, my brother
My sister, hold on tight
I finally got my orders
I'll be marching through the morning
Marching through the night
Moving cross the borders
Of my secret life

Looked through the paper
Makes you wanna cry
Nobody cares if the people
Live or die
And the dealer wants you thinking
That it's either black or white
Thank God it's not that simple
In my secret life

I bite my lip
I buy what I'm told
From the latest hit
To the wisdom of old
But I'm always alone
And my heart is like ice
And it's crowded and cold
In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life

I steal a kiss from her sleeping shadow moves
Cause I'll always miss her wherever she goes
And I'll always need her more than she could ever need me
I need someone to ease my mind
But sometimes a someone is so hard to find
And I'll do anything to keep her here tonite
And I'll say anything to make her feel alright
And I'll be anything to keep her here tonite
Cause I want you to stay, with me
I need you tonite
She comes to me like an angel out of time
As I play the part of a saint on my knees
There are some things I'll live without

World to which a man can cling
So happy at times when I break out in tears
Back of my mind I still have my fears

I live my life with her
Love her true, she knows I'm sure
I make her happy just living so plain
Back of my mind I'm 'fraid it's gonna change

I tried to run far away from thoughts, I should try to keep away
But they just keep coming back to me
I tried to rationalize but some day I might realize
That things are just good the way they'll be

I know it's so hard to find
A girl who really understands your mind
What will I do if I lose her?
It'll always be way in the back of my mind"

Half a dozen jobs makes his money
He is just a boy in the city
Friday night propels Walter Mitty
It's about time
He can read the signs
A night on the town
In the city
Monday is a work day
Tuesday's much the same
Wednesday comes and goes away
Thursday's back again
Friday night to Sunday in the morning
Monday brings the weekend's final yawning

He is miles away

Yes, we all feign a laugh
We all cry in the dark
Get cut off before we start

And as your first act begins
You realise they're all waiting
For a fall, for a flaw, for the end

And there's a path stained with tears
Could you talk to quiet my fears
Could you pull me aside
Just to acknowledge that i've tried

As your last breath begins
Contently take it in
Cause we all get it in
The end

And as your last breath begins
You find your demon's your best friend
And we all get it in
The end"
in the forest,the coral,"I've just stepped outside of a dream
Nothing ever is as it seems
The wind keeps whistling the same old tune
You lay asleep in the light of the moon
So silently, I peer through the trees
My misery was in her beauty
Her hair hung long and her eyes were closed
That very moment she stole my soul

I'm in the forest so rare and divine
This is the place where you lose your mind
From all of the feelings that are making you blue
You'll never know how much I—you

When she awoke and walked downstream
Stuck outside of that same old dream
I need to leave but my mind's intrigued
Follow close but she doesn't see me
Out of the forest to the church's gate
By her grave she awaits her fate
My only crime was to want too much
I could look but I could not touch

I'm in the forest so rare and divine
This is the place where you lose your mind
From all of the feelings that are making you blue
You'll never know how much I—you"

How the darkness faded in the light
Light

Hand of hope come and change me
Out of ashes make me whole
Lift me up and recreate me
And help me overcome
Myself, lead me from hell

Lift me up
Lead me from this place

Rising up, I change before your eyes
How the darkness faded in the light

I'm rising up, I'm moving on
Give me strength to carry on

My broken wings that learnt to fly
Lift me up and justify

I feel the walls comes crashing down

When the sun is high in the afternoon sky
You can always find something to do
But from dusk till dawn as the clock ticks on
Something happens to you
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all
That's the time you miss her most of all"
in transit,"albert hammond, jr.","Free from it all
I'm not gonna change till I want to
And I'm free from it all
I'm not gonna change till I want to

By the way she looked
I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh, that's all I've got to say

By the way she looked
I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh, that's all I've got to say

Free from it all
I'm not gonna change till I want to

Oh, that's all I've got to say

By the way she looked

in your arms,little caesar,"Everything ain't what it seems
In this world of broken dreams
And the things they try to teach you
Sure ain't what you've seen
But you make it all seem right
When you whisper in the night
Won't you wrap those calming arms around me?
Hold me tight
Hold me near through the years
Through the fears, through the tears

Well it makes you wanna shout
With the crap they're dishin' out
You're the only one it seems
To make it all work out
And you're always by my side
Puttin' up with foolish pride
When the day to day fiascos
Only multiply
You're the heart, you're the soul
When the world takes it's toll

The load is getting lighter
When I'm in your arms
Just squeeze a little tighter
When I'm in your arms
In your arms
In your arms

With my back against the wall
When you keep standing tall
When I stumble, you are
Always there to break my fall
When I'm far away from home
I can call you on the phone
When I hear your voice
Then certainly I'm not alone
All the words that you say
Make the miles drift away

The load is getting lighter
When I'm in your arms
Just squeeze a little tighter
When I'm in your arms
'Cause it all seems so easy
When I'm in your arms
Just hold me tight and squeeze me
When I'm in your arms
In your arms

You take me far away from there
When you hold me in your arms right away, yeah!

Everything ain't what it seems
In this world of broken dreams
And the things they try to teach you
Sure ain't what you've seen
In the dark, in the night

You're the heart, you're the soul

in your eyes,anastacia,"Tripped along many stones
Enough to say
I found my own way
I don't know where to go
Couldn't see where it leads

Making castles in the sand
Afraid no one else would hold my hand
I'm stained from the world
Sad, sad, sad little girl

But I see in your eyes
Your wear no disguise
Help me find my way
I'm like a bird in the sky
You helped me to fly
Fly away
Fly away
Back home... back home

Holding on to memories
Often scared
Of what I'd see
And then you came
And then you came
And rescued me
And I'm okay
I'm okay

But I see in your eyes
You wear no disguise
Help me find my way
I'm like a bird in the sky
You helped me to fly
Fly away
Fly away

Oh and I know you'll never leave me alone
I'll follow you just anywhere that you go
In my life I can see you
I know I believe you will stay, oh
In your eyes
You wear no disguise
Oh oh oh
Like a bird in the sky
You helped me to fly
Oh yeah oh oh oh

In your eyes oh oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah hey yeah oh

in your room,halestorm,"Let me in your room
I've seen the rest of you
But I know there's something more in your room
I'm right outside your door
Show me things you've never shown before
A few pictures from your past
And those walls you painted black
And the secrets that you keep under your bed
All you have to do, is let me in your room
You can be yourself
You don't have to hide from me I won't tell
I know everyone you've ever trusted has let you down
And you don't want to come out
And show me, show me
A few pictures from your past
And those walls you painted black
And the secrets that you keep under your bed
All you have to do, is let me in your room
You know every part of me
I let you in, I let you see
All the dark and every color of my room
Let me do that for you
And tell me all about your past
Why you painted those walls black
Baby it's all right you're safe in here with me
Open up so I can see
A few pictures from your past
And those walls you painted black
And the secrets that you keep under your bed
An unopened letter from your dad
A poster of your favorite band
It don't matter, I'll take every part of you
All you have to do is let me in your room
Let me in your room"
indiana,jon mclaughlin,"I'm glad i never lived next to the water
So I could never get used to the beach
And I'm glad I never grew up on a mountain
To figure out how high the world could reach
I love the miles between me and the city
Where I quietly imagine every street
And I'm glad I'm only picturing the moment
I'm glad she never fell in love with me

For some the world's a treasure to discover
And your scenery should never stay the same
And they're trading in their dreams for Explanations
All in an attempt to entertain
But I love the miles between me and the city
Where I quietly imagine every street
And I'm glad I'm only picturing the moment

I'm glad she never fell in love with me

The trick of love is to never let it find you
It's easy to get over missing out
I know the how's and whens, but now and then,
She's all I think about

I wonder how it feels to be famous
But wonder is as far as I will go
Because I'd probably lose myself in all the Pictures
And end up being someone I don't know.
So it's probably best I stay in Indiana
Just dreaming of the world as it should be
Where every day is a battle to convince myself
I'm glad she never fell in love with me"
indifference,pearl jam,"I will light the match this morning
So I won't be alone
Watch as she lies silent
For soon night will be gone
Oh I will stand arms outstretched
Pretend I'm free to roam
I will make my way
Through one more day in hell

How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?

I will hold the candle
Till it burns up my arm
Oh, I'll keep takin' punches
Until their will grows tired
Oh, I will stare the sun down
Until my eyes go blind
Hey, I won't change direction
And I won't change my mind

How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?

I'll swallow poison, until I grow immune
I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room

How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
How much difference?"
inferno,brendan perry,"I watch the TV, it is my world
Takes my mind beyond these walls
The more I see, the less I care
For all the people out there

In my room, I see war
In my room, love
In my room, visions from hell
In my room, joy

I like to watch as the newsreel unfolds
I like to watch from behind glass walls
The more I see the less I care
For all the people down there

In my room, I see war
In my room, love
In my room, visions from hell
In my room, joy

I may be alone inside to see you
Memories are born of fire to see you
Can't make it love, and I can't ever sombre
Memories fall out of desires

I may be long, and so I maybe a reason
Take it away from hurt and make it a hero
Can't make it love and I can't ever sombre
Memories fall out of desires

Sometimes, I just don't feel myself at all
Sometimes, I don't feel anything at all

Sometimes
Sometimes"

innocent,cassidy,"Did my time in a county jail just when
Just when things started goin' well
And I paid the price for the crimes I did
Wanna change my life, wanna raise my kids

I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood, I'm just from the hood

I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood but the man is good, understood?

I do the damn thing, bezel and the damn bling
Sling grams, spend 10 grand on a damn ring
I run Philly, I ain't tryin' to be the damn king
But the damn thing could get pulled like a hamstring

I used to hang with these niggas from my hood man
Yeah, I showed them the world, I took 'em out the hood man
Yeah, it cost some change but it's all good man
'Cause I got money to burn like backwoods man

And we was smokin', jokin' and poppin' bottles
Gettin' open, strokin', pokin' and poppin' models
I was hopin', that they could get paper with me
But when I started gettin' cake they started hatin' on me

They showed up to the crib that my mother was at
My son, my baby mother and my brother was at
And they was strapped, actin' tough and started bustin' they gat
To protect my family I started bustin' it back

I'm an innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood, I'm just from the hood

I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood but the man is good, understood?

Jail vicious, it's hard to be patient and stay strong
When you get pictures of chicks half naked in they thongs
The anticipation be makin' the days long
I waited 'cause I just gotta make it like Trey Songz

My lawyers couldn't lose, they proved the D.A. wrong
I smiled at the trial, kept cool and stayed calm
I waved at my mom and swallowed my pride man
Them guys on the stand brought tears to my eyes man

The stuff they was discussin' was nothin' but lies man
They said I bust the chrome at homie that died man
I thought them lil' dudes was part of my squad man
'Til they started actin' up but they must've been high man

You see that I ain't shook from the look in my eyes man
But bein' booked was a blessin' in disguise man
I needed time to get my life organized man
So everythin' that happened was part of my God's plan, understand?

I'm an innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood, I'm just from the hood

I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood but the man is good, understood?

Involuntary manslaughter, just parole
I spanked the murder like a bad ass 6 year old
I knew that I was gon' be rich since I was 6 years old
Now I'm the richest rapper under 26 years old

So it's on now, I'm home now, it's a celebration
I got my drink and my 2 step 'cause I'm elevatin'
I'm gettin' hella cake and with the number 1 record
But I'll still bust my gun if you come test it

Change the life that I, that I live
Got me livin' fine, livin' negative
Need to leave the game that is destroyin' me
So I pray to God that He has mercy

I'm an innocent man, I'm an innocent man
I'm an innocent man, I'm an innocent man
I'm an innocent man, I'm an innocent man
I'm an innocent man"

Insects buzzing in my eye
Buzzing insects make me want to dance dance dance

Insects squirming in the ground
Insects gooey squeaky chewy
Should I eat them--no
I'd rather stomp them hurt them stomp
Stomp them while I dance dance dance
I hurt them while I dance dance dance
I stomp them while I dance dance dance . . .
Insects make me scream and shout
They don't know what life's about
They don't have blood
They've got too many legs
They don't have brains in their heads
They know they'll rule the world some day
They bite and sting me anyway
They bite and sting and suck
They bite and sting and suck suck suck
They bite and sting and
Suck suck suck suck suck . . .

Wants to to count count her steps

Eighteen teen strides and she stops to abide
By the law that she herself has set

That eighteen steps is one complete set
And before the next nine right and nine left

She looks up up at the blue
And whispers to all of the above

Dont let me drown
Dont breathe alone
No kicks, no pints, no broken bones

Never let me sink. always feel at home
No sticks, no shanks and no stones

Never leave it too late just enjoy the taste
Of a great great great grey world of hearts

As all dogs everywhere bark bark bark bark
Its worth knowing

Like all good fruit the balance of life is in the ripe and ruin"

While we sleep in the same bed fully clothed
We are two wheels only one is on the road
At least to her

Come feel my energy
We give emotions to each other
Put your love all over me

Put your love all over me

Put your love all over

I know it might seem crazy
But I'ma put you in this blindfold

Not gonna beg, so don't make me

Yes or no, but no maybes

Feeling something, kinda thinking out loud
Feeling something, kinda thinking right now, right now
We could be right, right now
Right now

Hope it sets us free
To know each other better
Put your love all over me
Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy
We give emotions to each other

Put your love all over"
irresistible,nikki cleary,"You're irresistible
I know I should have said goodbye
I know I should have looked away this time
And I know that we're the best of friends
And you don't know what I am hiding
Underneath this smile
I'm dying
Whenever you leave

*Chorus*
You're irresistible
I think you know
That you're so missable
Every time you go
You're lips are kissable
I know you know
You're irresistible
That's why I can't say no

You're looking into my eyes
And I'm trying to disguise all of my thoughts
But every time that you're around
Each and every time I fall apart
So hard to listen to my mind
Now my heart is so hard
It tears me apart

*Chorus*
You're irresistible
I think you know
That you're so missable
Every time you go
You're lips are kissable
I know you know
You're irresistible
That's why I can't say no

I can't say no
I can't say no
You're irresistible
And (Oooh)
There's something about the way I wanna
Hold onto to you
(You-you-you)
And I know
That if I had my way baby
I'd stay and never let go
I'd never let go

*Chorus*
You're irresistible
I think you know
That you're so missable
Every time you go
You're lips are kissable
I know you know
You're irresistible
That's why I can't say no

You're irresistible
Baby you know
Baby you know
That you're so missable
Every time you go
(Don't go no where)
You're lips are kissable
I know you know
You're irresistible
That's why I can't say no

I can't say no
I can't say no
I can't say no
You're irresistable

Every time you go
Every time you go
You're irresistible

I can't control my brain

You don't need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone

On an island in the sun

I can't control my brain

We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore

islands,sara bareilles,"Waiting for the bus stop
Waiting for the concrete black top to settle down
Long enough for me to get off and get a little ground
I'm ready for the sea change
Helpless felt this coming from a mile away
And now you're looking at me babe, and how we'll separate if we can
Cause I still count on one hand the number of good men I know

It's like I'm standing on the edge with just a telephone wire
Trying to get to you first to say the world's on fire
Holding my breath until I know you're alright
Because the water will only rise
When will you realize
You must become an island
You must become an island
You must become an island
And see for yourself that that's what I am

You always dirty up the windows
If you keep 'em at bay that way no one's gonna surprise you by getting too close
Anybody but me though
You've made exceptions to you rules
And now we're staring down truth neither one of us wants to know

It's like I'm standing on the edge with just a telephone wire
Trying to get to you first to say the world's on fire
Holding my breath until I know you're alright
Because the water will only rise
When will you realize
You must become an island

isles,fleet foxes,"Everyone stares when you walk in the room
They stare when you go
You've got so much control
How could anyone say no
They rarely do, that's why you're you
And why you're winning
And I don't even miss you at all, no, no

Caught in the light, you would idly spin your skeleton ring
See it shine when you sing
To the window with no meaning
From Tennessee, your harmony would leave your spirit
And I don't even miss you at all, no, no

Silver, the shores of isles I've known
Boulevards of dancing boats
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

You keep the old ember burning with the meadows in mind
As the coaches go by, these thoughts of you will die
They rarely do, that's why you're you
And why you're winning

isobel,dido,"I thought it was funny when you missed the train
When I rang you at home they said you left yesterday
I thought it was strange when your car was found
By the tree in Ennis where we used to hang around

Dear Isobel
I hope you're well and what you've done is right
Oh it's been such hell
I wish you well I hope you're safe tonight

It's been a long day coming and long will it last
When it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it pass by loving you more

And who he would become, all the things he'd have done
Would he have loved you, and not let you down
And would he be stronger than his father
Don't punish yourself, leave it well alone

Dear Isobel
I hope you're well and what you've done is right
Oh it's been such hell
I wish you well I hope you're safe tonight

It's been a long day coming and long will it last
When it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it pass by loving you more

It's been a long day coming and long will it last
When it's last day leaving,
And I'm helping it pass by loving, loving you more."
isolation,ann wilson,"(John Lennon)

[Originally by John Lennon]

People say we got it made don't they know we're so afraid
We're afraid to be alone, everbody got to have a home
Isolation

Just a boy and a little girl
Trying to change the whole wide world
Isolation

All the world is a little town
Everybody trying to put us down
Isolation

I don't expect you to understand
After you caused so much pain
But the again you're not to blame
Your just a human, a victim of the insane

We're afrain of everyone, afraid of the sun
Isolation

The Sun will never disappear
But the world my not have many years

it doesn't matter,alison krauss,"It doesn't matter what I want
It doesn't matter what I need
It doesn't matter if I cry
Don't matter if I bleed

You've been on a road
Don't know where it goes or where it leads

It doesn't matter what I want
It doesn't matter what I need
If you've made up your mind to go
I won't beg you to stay

You've been in a cage
Throw you to the wind, you fly away

It doesn't matter what I want
It doesn't matter what I need
It doesn't matter if I cry
Don't matter if I bleed

Falling on this face, you've loved for years"
it makes no difference now,ray charles,"Makes no difference now, what kind of life fate hands me
I'll get along, without you now it's plain to see
I don't care what happens next, I'll forget somehow
And I don't worry 'cause it make no difference now

It was just a year ago when first I met you
And I learned to love you and I thought you loved me too
But that's all in the past and I'll forget somehow
Well, I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

Now that we have really parted I can't believe it's true
I don't blame myself and I'm sure I can't blame you
There was something, had to happen and it did somehow
Oh, I just don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

After all is said and done I'll forget you
Although I know it will be hard to do
Let things happen as they will, I'll get along somehow
I don't worry, it makes no difference now
It makes no difference now, oh, no difference now"
it was you,sharleen spiteri,"Remember when you said we'd run away
And that you'd love me 'til your dying day
Rumours started you had someone new
I just laughed 'cause that was all I could do
There was me in love all on my own
10 years, if only I had known
So you thought you'd come on back to me
I am not the girl that I used to be

'Cause you, you weren't the one for me
I can't go back, back to just you and me
'Cause I couldn never lie, something inside just died
It was you

How does it feel to be so untrue?
And there's nothing even you can do
All those years of lying to yourself
I think you'll find that you're back on the shelf now
So I hid behind my smile
Lost in thought just for a while
Then one day I walked away
No you never loved me anyway

'Cause you, you weren't the one for me
I can't go back, back to just you and me
'Cause I could never lie, something inside just died
It was you

Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me

'Cause you, you weren't the one for me
I can't go back, back to just you and me

You weren't the one for me
'Cause I could never lie, something inside just died

it's a shame,onerepublic,"I tried to get to you
Pushing in vain, to break me through.
I tried with all I had
You left me standing empty handed.
Well, time has passed, nothing ever lasts, so.

Now, you confess that you need me
And now you release what you're feeling
But how is this supposed to ever be the same?
Oh it's a shame
It's a shame
Oh it's a shame
No, it's a shame.

You got the best of me
Got me to reason, got me on my knee yah.
My love, I lost my pride
Searching for something I couldn't find.
Well time apart has brought a change of heart

And now, you confess that you need me
And now you release what you're feeling
But how is this supposed to ever be the same?
Oh it's a shame

Oh it's a shame
No, It's a shame.

Yeah...

it's about time,cheryl cole,"I'm asking myself if living without a feeling is really living
Is heaven everything any good?
If everything's all you have

Dreaming of blue skies
Nothing on my way
Just the person in the mirror
Take me to the flame
It's now or never
It's about time that I start loving again
It's about time the sun shine touches my skin
I'll hold your feelings till my heart beats again
Will somebody show me what I've been missing
Yeah, it's about time that start loving again
For all the time I was so scared of flying
So I stuck to the running
But I'm not running anymore
I'm dancing my nights away
No I'm wide awake
I got my eye on the horizon
Watch me fly away
Into the blue sky
Nothing in my way
Just the person in the mirror
Take me to the flame
It's now or never
It's about time that I start loving again
It's about time the sun shine touches my skin
I'll hold your feelings till my heart beats again
Will somebody show me what I've been missing
Yeah, it's about time that start loving again
Each bottle of emotion
Each tear I never cried
I need a big explosion
It's time for me to fly

Don't see why it should

They leave the party, and they never get home

A teacup of water is enough to drown
You oughta know if they could, they would
Whatever going down, it's all good
All good, say it's all good

Some of 'em so sick, they can hardly stand
Everybody would move away, if they could
It's hard to believe, but it's all good
Yeah

The widows cry, the orphans plea
Everywhere you look there's more misery
Come along with me babe, I wish you would
You know what I'm saying, it's all good
All good, I said it's all good, all good

A cold blooded killer stalking the town
Cop cars blinkin', something bad going down
Buildings are crumbling in the neighborhood
But there's nothing to worry about, 'cause it's all good
It's all good, I say it's all good, whoo

About the love that I've been denied
Once I thought that we could make it
But I couldn't fake it
So I'd rather let the whole thing ride
Oh and maybe in some time
I'll free your memory from my mind
Oh 'cause there's no turning back the clock
I've put you down and counted out
And it's all over but the shoutin'
It's all over, all over but the shoutin'

All over, all over but the shoutin'
It's all over, all over but the shoutin'
It's all over, now everything has been said

Soon I'll be forgotten

I'm gonna find someone lovin'

You thought it was a wrap, it's nothing (ghetto's across the world)
They got my phone tapped, it's nothing (Yo', this what they want)
Because the God is back, that's something (New York City)
This is what it is, it's nothing, (It's what they need)
You thought it was a wrap, it's nothing (East Coast to West coast)
They got my phone tapped, it's nothing (It's what it is)
Because the God is back, that's something (Across sea's, world-wide, baby)

Ayo, we.
Stuck in a time of drought, nothing to rhyme about
Ghetto and crime, on the grind, pulling iron out
Industry crying out, major labels buying out
Who put the fire out? Real Hip-Hop is dying out
Sounds like the perfect time for Ra, set off
A new beginning, let me finish where Nas left off
I went to LA to get with Dre, we tried to bridge the gap in
Take night, mix it with day, I guess it wasn't meant to happen
I move, lotta dudes hope I lose but its cool, baby
I'm like Ray, I make it do what it do, baby
Bounce like medallions 'til it's off the chain
And I remain up in the lab 'til it's engulfed in flames
Just call me too hot, same ol' hood look like a new spot
A new block, like Time Square 'fore the doo-wop
Without the gun on my Hip I bring the new Hop
For Scott La Rock, Freaky Tah, L, Biggie Smalls and 2Pac, I'm back

This is what it is, it's nothing

They got my phone tapped, it's nothing
Because the God is back, that's something

This is hell and hell is where the storm is, drug sellers kill for corners
Death is here to haunt us, the president's still in office
The heaven's hear the horrors, and letters fill with warriors
Deadly weapons fell before us, the Seventh Seal's upon us
Rakim won't fear, begin to fear, the end is here, you goners
Stiff as rigormortis, now let 'em feel the When the God spit, I'm still a yards stick of real performance
Record deals and touring, my repp is still enormous
I hit the block or party and mami's be watching papi
A show be smashed, photographed by the paparazzi
My army's armed and highly, don't bring no drama by me
It's deadly, fill your boy with blanks, slash, kamikaze
The alpha and omega, no doubted innovator
In front of your bodega, it's the style-originator
You doubters and you haters, Ra 'bout to end your data
With Writer's Block, I'm off the top, without the pen, no paper
The archeologist that y'all acknowledging
Then I start the apocalypse then watch the God demolish it
I heard the news, this the dude they wanna hear from
Take it from square one, lace up them Air One's
Then bring the new commandments to the planets
For living life in the hood and for the music fanatics
It's for the time's beyond and my love for writing songs
When the club mic is on, I'm on my just to cipher, bomb, I'm back

This is what it is, it's nothing

it's okay,land of talk,"It's okay.
I don't even cry.
All I think about
Is a memory.
In the dream

When you kiss my arm
As I look away
Don't hear what I say.
That maybe when I die
I get to be a car,
Driving in the night-
Lighting up the dark.
Something in your voice-

It sparks a little hope.
I'll wait up for that noise.
Your voice becomes my home.
One way road,

Don't care what I find.
A little thunder's good, thought maybe you would
But it's okay, we all feel left out.
Sometimes growing up

It can get you down.
I give you some thing that no one's going to give you.
My sleepin' skin and my heart deep down in you.
I'll never tell you, but you're my little sca.r
Goodbyes are hard and their hard and their hard...
Maybe when I die
I get to be a car,
Driving in the night-
Lighting up the dark.
But something in your voice
Sparks a little hope.
I'll wait up for that noise
Your voice becomes my home."
it's over now,l.a. guns,"Just another night
And I'm all alone
I wonder where you are
Who you're holding

And I'm wasting time
By the telephone
It gets harder when there's no way of knowing

I always thought we'd be together someday
There was nothing that could keep me away
Coulda worked it out somehow
But it's over now
Thought you'd be comin' 'round
But it's over now

When I close my eyes
I can see your face
There was still so much to discover
All the time we shared
Can't be erased
Now you're in the arms of another

I always thought we'd be together someday
There was nothing that could keep me away
Coulda worked it out somehow
But it's over now
Thought you'd be comin' 'round

If you broke my heart
I can't let it show
I can take the pain
I can't let you go

I guess it had to be
Even though you're gone now
You still mean so much to me

Just another day
I'm still holdin' on
No matter how I try
I can't shake this feeling
Yeah I'm sitting here

No tears to cry, no sun to shine
I seen your picture
I mean, I've kissed you
If I had my own way
I'll kiss you again

it's probably me,eric clapton & sting,"If the night turned cold and the stars looked down
And you'd hug yourself on the cold, cold ground
You wake the morning in a stranger's coat
No one would you see

Ask yourself 'Who'd watch for me?'
My only friend, who could it be?
It's hard to say it, I hate to say it
But it's probably me

Your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the cityFor your only friend
No one would you see

Ask yourself who could it be
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I hate to say it, hate to say it
But it's probably me

You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feeling show
Some would say I should let you go your way you'll only make me cry

But if there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I hate to say it, I hate to say it
But it's probably me

When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
And there's only one voice that comes to your defense
And the jury's out and your eyes search the room
One friendly face is all you need to see

If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I hate to say it, I hate to say it
But it's probably me

I hate to say it, I hate to say it

Make up your mind
And I won't let you go
Don't waste precious time
Here and now

Sweet pretender...
I've got the key to find
True surrender...
I'm gonna make you're mine

It's so easy now
How can it be so easy?
And tonight...
I realize how lucky
Love can be with you

It's so easy now
How can it be so easy?
And tonight...
No one can take you from me
You're forever mine"
it's true,new buffalo,"Five o'clock
There's coffee cups and magazines
You're breaking up
I hold the phone right to my ear
I'm sick of saying I wish you were here
I got myself into this mess
I chose to wear this stupid dress
My memory's no good for me
There's one place where I want to be

You are you are you are you are
It's true it's true it's true it's true
You are you are you are you are
It's true it's true it's true it's true

One million people with one idea
To get the hell right out of here
You've packed your car
You've packed brain
With things to lose
And things to gain
I see you now you're sitting there
With crumpled dreams and messed up hair
It's black and blue
It's black and white
It's exactly what I want tonight

You are you are you are you are
It's true it's true it's true it's true"

ivory tower,alphaville,"Here is the news
From my little hideaway
My sweet ivory tower
I've sent you songs about so many things
Mighty moondogs skipping waves
Dolphins playing their lives away
Golden circus girls and pharaohs
Fallen angels, streetside romeos
Patricia's park and anyway
Eternal youth and neverending summerdays
Lonely girls, music halls, the mysteries of love

In the event
That i don't return
Please take this message to understand
In the event...
I am a stranger
In a strange land
Welcome stranger, to the land of the free
Welcome, carol, to fantasy

Oh my god, i feel so alone
A million lightyears far from home
It seems to be a tragedy
How can i live in germany
Another house is burning down
It's time to face the cruel reality
This is a game no more
Desasters in the twentieth century

jack the ripper,colin meloy,"Oh, you look so tired
Mouth slack and wide
Ill-housed and ill-advised
Your face is as mean
As your life has been

Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree
But you don't refuse
I know you

And I know a place
Where no-one is likely to pass
Oh, you don't care if it's late
And you don't care if you're lost
And oh, you look so tired
But tonight you've presumed too much
Too much, too much
And if it's the last thing I ever do
I'm gonna get you

Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree
But you don't refuse
I know you

And no one knows a thing about my life
I can come and go as I please
If I want to I can stay
Or if I want to I can leave
Nobody knows me, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me, nobody knows me
Aah, aah, nobody knows me
Aah, aah, nobody knows me
Aah, aah, nobody knows me"
jade,edward sharpe & the magnetic zeros,"She runs through the Valley of Death and of Sleeping
She laughs as she dances her feet wake the flowers
She comes a now running through our gloomy town
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour
We can't help but follow she's Buddha just watch her
She moves like an old gypsy woman but swears she's a girl
And all that she asks we'll allow her
For Jade is the girl of the hour
It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour so let it be hers
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour
The people in town now just wake up to see her for
When she smiles they all feel the power
The strong men the children and even the cowards
Know Jade's the girl of the hour
It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour and always it's hers
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour
You won't soon forget the name
Softly now join her she's blessed for construction
She sings and sounds off the hammer of god
Man, I swear she's come here to fill us with power
It's Jade the girl of the hour
It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour so let it be hers
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour

Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour so let it be hers

james,billy joel,"James... we were always friends
From our childhood days
And we made our plans
And we had to go our separate ways.
I went on the road-
You pursued an education.

James... do you like your life
Can you find release
And will you ever change-
Will you ever write your masterpiece.
Are you still in school-
Living up to expectations... james...

You were so relied upon, everybody knows how hard you tried-
Hey... just look at what a job you've done
Carrying the weight of family pride.
James... you've been well behaved
You've been working hard
But will you always stay-
Someone else's dream of who you are.
Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody... james.

I went on the road-
You pursued an education... james...
How you gonna know for sure-everything was so well organized.
Hey... now everything is so secure
And everybody else is satisfied.

James... do you like your life
Can you find release
And will you ever change
When will you write your masterpiece.
Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody... james..."

jc,sonic youth,"Always cost a pair of hose, faces pressed together rose
Arms around each other's back, you know that I liked you jack
Than all the other boys who pose, a silent dance in the woods
In the silver light that shone, another can of Coca-Cola
Don't you ever call me mom, freckled dance ain't in the plan
The air's so thin, it weighs a ton, as far as you can see is fun
You're nothing but a history, a second here and then you're gone

Quicksand, quicksand all around, turn the corner just beyond
The shadows move and change the groove, and something tells me not to brood
Turn and run and that's a shove, you're walking through my heart once more
Don't forget to close the door, I'm not certain what you found
I'll remember the charm you wore, like a crowd followed you

Sunny skies and angel's pleas floating down upon my knees
That wasn't how it's supposed to be, clear blue eyes, justice tries
The wind is busy blowing dizzy, you're dreams were shot like a star
Exploding in a mind somewhere, doing something on a dare
Pulling a trigger like breathing air, a sun-kissed boy that gave no thought
To what he'd made while others saved

Ocean spray the candle said, it's dripping in my hand, you're dead
Little brother reminding me, the moments tick forever tree
You can see as far as sin, don't you know the shape I'm in
You're walking through my heart once more, don't forget to close the door"
je t'aime encore,céline dion,"Ici l'automne chasse un été de plus
La 4L est morte on a repeint la rue
Élise a deux dents, Petit Jean est grand et fort
J'apprends la guitare, j'en suis à trois accords

J'ai trouvé des girolles au marché ce matin
J'aimerais vivre à Rome oh j'aimerais bien
J'ai planté des tulipes elles tardent à éclore
C'est tout je crois, ah oui, je t'aime encore

Mais où es-tu?
Aussi loin sans même une adresse
Et que deviens-tu?
L'espoir est ma seule caresse

J'ai coupé mes cheveux, enfin dirais-tu
Oh ça m'a fait bizarre mais j'ai survécu
On m'invite, on me désire et je danse et je sors
Et quand je danse, je t'aime encore

Mais où es-tu?
Aussi loin sans même une adresse
Et que deviens-tu?
L'attente est ma seule caresse

Et je t'aime encore
Comme dans les chansons banales
Ça me dévore
Et tout le reste m'est égal
De plus en plus fort
À chaque souffle, à chaque pas
Et je t'aime encore
Et toi tu ne m'entends pas"
je t'aime,lara fabian,"D'accord, il existait d'autres façons de se quitter
Quelques éclats de verres
Auraient peut-être pu nous aider
Dans ce silence amer, j'ai décidé de pardonner
Les erreurs qu'on peut faire à trop s'aimer

D'accord la petite fille en moi souvent te réclamait
Presque comme une mère, tu me bordais, me protégeais
Je t'ai volé ce sang qu'on aurait pas dû partager
A bout de mots, de rêves je vais crier

Je t'aime, je t'aime
Comme un fou comme un soldat
Comme une star de cinéma
Je t'aime, je t'aime

Comme un loup, comme un roi
Comme un homme que je ne suis pas
Tu vois, je t'aime comme ça

D'accord, je t'ai confié tous mes sourires, tous mes secrets
Même ceux, dont un frère est le gardien inavoué

Dans cette maison de pierre
Satan nous regardait danser
J'ai tant voulu la guerre
De corps qui se faisaient la paix

Je t'aime, je t'aime
Comme un fou comme un soldat
Comme une star de cinéma

Je t'aime, je t'aime

And the clouds are so low
You can touch them, and so
Come out to the meadow, Jean

Come out of your half-dreamed dream
And run, if you will, to the top of the hill
Open your arms, bonnie Jean
Till the sheep in the valley come home my way
Till the stars fall around me and find me alone
When the sun comes a-singin' I'll still be waitin'
For Jean, Jean, roses are red
And all of the leaves have gone green
While the hills are ablaze with the moon's yellow haze
Come into my arms, bonnie Jean

And run, if you will to the top of the hill
Come into my arms, bonnie Jean

There's a hole in the bed
Where we slept
Now it's growing cold
Hey Jesse, your face
In the place where we lay
By the hearth, all apart
It hangs on my heart

And I'm leaving the light on the stairs
No I'm not scared - I wait for you
Hey Jesse, I'm lonely, come home

Jesse, the floors and the boards
Recalling your step
And I remember, too
All the pictures are fading
And shaded in grey
But I still set a place
On the table at noon

And I'm leaving a light on the stairs
No I'm not scared - I wait for you
Hey Jesse, I'm lonely, come home

Jesse, the spread on the bed
Is like when you left
I've kept it up for you
And all the blues and the greens
Have been recently cleaned
And it's seemingly new
Hey Jes, me and you

We'll swallow the light on the stairs
We'll do up my hair
And sleep unaware
Hey Jesse, I'm lonely, come home"
jessica,avi buffalo,"Jessica, why do you always make it so hard
You know I'm kidding but sometimes,
I feel like you're all I've got
Someone comes and tells you stop
I just won't ignore your calls
Please sit down, I can't express these thoughts without mistakes.
No one can make you loss your faith,
Except for someone who you love
And I still want to leave my mark
Show you that I fit the part

Remember when we talked on that
And it made you laugh
And these things don't have to last
If your bills stretch

Jessica, I'll try my best not to make this hard
I know I took this way too far
And I can't tell when somethings real.
Nobody tells me how they feel
It's always right beneath my nose
And if that's just the way it goes
Someone won't be there when you fall"

But must we share this memory?
The warm of your touch I cannot feel
You leave me this way

Jessie please don't go
I know you hear me
But words can't reach you now
We had too far to go
I know I'll miss you

Forever knowing yesterday
No time for time all gone away

The kind you'd find on someone that could save
If they don't put me away
Well, it'll be a miracle
Do you believe you're missing out?
That everything good is happening somewhere else
But with nobody in your bed
The night's hard to get through

And I will die all alone
And when I arrive I won't know anyone

Jesus Christ, I'm alone again
So what did you do those three days you were dead?
'Cause this problem is gonna last
More than the weekend
Well, Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die
I'm a little bit scared of what comes after
Do I get the gold chariot?
Do I float through the ceiling?

Do I divide and fall apart?
'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark
And this ship went down in sight of land
And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands?

I know you're coming in the night like a thief
But I've had some time alone to hone my lying technique
I know you think that I'm someone you can trust
But I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up (everyone now)
So do you think that we could work out a sign?
So I'll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try
I know you'll come for the people like me

But we all got wood and nails
We turn, turn out hate in factories
Yeah, we all got wood and nails
We turn, turn out hate in factories
Yeah, we all got wood and nails
And we sleep inside of this machine"
jet lag,frank turner,"""Heard it,"" said the trick

That way you can trick
Workings of a tired brain
Sometimes I feel sick
Sometimes I just feel so drained
Cut down to the quick
Longing for that voice again
On the phone
You always ask if I'm okay
It's not the same as being happy
I traveling forty thousand miles last year
And I am working on the same again
I fell for fifteen different girls
And nearly lost all of my friends
Well I am jet set, jet lag, jaded
You're always sixteen hours ahead
Quietly reminding me how I used to be
Airports make me sad
I'm sure they shouldn't all be the same
But they're just landing pads
Boring tourist shopping chains
I remember times we had
Drinking while we wait for your plane
Feeling kinda bad
Wondering which one of us has changed
'Cause we used to be slick
Subtle young hips, romantic young kissable lips
Unbearably sharp, unbreakable heart
With wide eyes and faith
That life could never pull apart if we were okay
But distance kills the best of intentions
And never intended it to be this way
I traveling forty thousand miles last year
And I am working on the same again
I fell for fifteen different girls
And nearly lost all of my friends
Well I am jet set, jet lag, jaded
You're always sixteen hours ahead
Quietly reminding me how I used to be
I'm trying to remember how I used to be
Used to be slick
That was the one

Like she'd done one hundred times before.
Jolene smoothed her dark hair in the mirror.
She folded the towel carefully and put it back in place.
Yeah I want to pull you down into bed.
I want to cast your face in lead.
Well every time I pull you close
Push my face into your hair
Cream rinse and tobacco smoke
That sickly scent is always  always there.
Jolene heard her father's uneven snores.
Right then she knew there must be something more.
Jolene heard the singing in the forest.
She opened the door quietly and stepped into the night.
Yeah I want to throw you out into space.
I want to do whatever it takes, takes, takes.
Well every time I pull you close,
Push my face into your hair,
Cream rinse and tobacco smoke,
That sickly scent is always, always there."

And the ocean to the sky

But to say that I've lost you
Is a selfish thing to say
I've never seen nothing as beautiful
As watching you slip away

I'd rather see you go in the arms of your angels
Than to stay right here with me
I'll meet you on the other side of the Jordan
Now let your soul go free

You did it all with feeling
And failure, you took it gracefully
You said, third star to the right
And straight on until morning
When you need me, you know
That's where I'll be

Now the rest of my life without you
Right now it's hard to conceive
You said, don't cry for me now
You've got to remember
There is no death for those that believe

I'd rather see you go in the arms of your angels
Then to keep you right here with me
I'll meet you on the other side of the Jordan
Now let your soul go free
Let your soul go free

Meet you on the other side of the Jordan
Now let your soul be free
Rather see you go in the arms of your angels

If I were Napoleon, I might be in magazines
I'd write some science fiction - science fiction about you
You could be my Josephine: just you and your chaperone
Let you be my Josephine, Josephine
If I were Napoleon, you could be my lady love
Look into my soft blue eyes
Run your fingers through my hair
If I were Napoleon, you could be my turtle-dove
Living out in Corsica in our summer cottages
And you could be my Josephine and we could be Siamese twins
Let you be my Josephine, Josephine"
josie,donovan,"Josie, I won't fail ya
I won't fail you, have no fear
Josie, I won't fail ya
Give me one more chance to be as near

The meadows, they are burstin'
The yellow corn lies in your hands
And with the night comes sorrow
As the tide of dawn slips on the land

The long breezes are blowin'
All down the sky, into my face
I've a weary kind of feelin'
Like my time has come and gone to waste

I love you, darling Josie
The trees of pine, they grow so tall
How come you came to love me
When you didn't love me at all?

Josie, I won't fail ya
I won't fail you, have no fear
Josie, I won't fail ya
Give me one more chance to be as near

My Josie looks a child now
As she lies beyond my breast
In the night I think about her
In the day I get no rest

I cut me a young pine cone
And I gave it to the river deep
It sailed way by your window
Where you lay so long in sleep

God bless you, darling Josie
With your sparkling eyes so bright and clear
Josie, I won't fail ya
I wont fail you, have no fear

Josie, I won't fail ya
I wont fail you, have no fear
Josie, I won't fail ya
Give me one more chance to be as near"
joy,against me!,"All's quiet, except for this song
So maybe while I'm not together I can feel like I'm not alone
And somewhere off in the distance, rapidly advancing, is an onslaught of sorts
Young sirens wail in a skewed sense of glory
And the lions in the cages roar at the memory of fight
And there's a joy, a joy in all I can see
A joy, in every possibility
And all around us is a great, great failing
American rockets red-glare in a most
disgusting triumph
And in passing I am asked ""Do you believe in a God?""
I shrug off the answer, continue to get high
in this terror of no explanation
I am looking for a faith
My panic is an only reason
There's a joy, a joy in all I can see
A joy, in every possibility"

Take a little girl who gets to see her mama broke down
Now she's a lady made for the modern world, my life
But if you ask my advice us raging girls are china dolls fed up With all that follows
All the way down
Digging up holy scriptures to shame her while she drowns

judgement day,diamanda galás,"(To the saints of New York City, both living and dead)

Dead souls rising
Hear our crying
To the Jailers of the Dying,
You shall hang on Judgment Day.

On that Day
The Dead shall wake thee
Wandering flesh shall all surround thee
To seal your fate on Judgment Day.

Let us call the guilty forward
Hang the sinner, Brand the coward
Let them burn on Judgment Day.

Run, you liars
Fate awaits thee
When your Faces shall expose thee
None can hide on Judgment Day.

Join the Paradise of Torture
While we pluck your tongues of murder
Hear our laughter Judgment Day.

Blood of sinners
Hear our shrieking
Blood of sinners all beseeching;
We shall drink you Judgment Day.

HAIL OUR SAINTS ON JUDGMENT DAY."
july,ocean colour scene,"It's warm outside
But I can hear the snow
Falling on my window
I had to go away
To somewhere deeper down
I know it's my mistake
To take off out of this town
And June becomes July

This road's on fire
And my train's running slow
It rains against my window
I had to get away
To somewhere no-one knows
I know it's my mistake
To take off now in this way
And June becomes July

The air is thin
When you're above the clouds
I see them from my window
It's strange to get away now
To somewhere no-one goes
I know it's my mistake
But I don't even know now
And June becomes July
And June becomes July"

It's fluid
With you by my side
Got nothing to hide
Now that you're hurting
I see the tears behind those eyes
And I can't wipe them clear
Your love is like gold to me

But you hold me closer to the light
Wouldn't find the bullet inside
Unless you magnified
But you throw me into the deep end
Expect me to know how to swim
And I put my faith inside my hands
'Cause I will be just fine

Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me?
Welcome to the jungle
You got to close your eyes to see
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me?
Well, no
Well, no

Sitting tight with my black jeans on
And I'm paralysed make your way toward the sun
Got the palest soul you ever seen, oh darling
You might be the one
Sitting tight with my curly hair
And you're making your way with that sheepish stare
Said are you real, do you feel, are you there?

Ashes to ashes
In the embers I, I blaze
Oh, I gotta rise amongst it all
And I think about your face every day
But you pull me closer to the light
You wouldn't find the bullet inside
Only if you magnified

Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me?
Welcome to the jungle
You got to close your eyes to see
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me?

just a feeling,maroon 5,"I watched you cry, bathed in sunlight by the bathroom door
You said you wished you did not love me anymore
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car
The things we said and did have left permanent scars

Obsessed, depressed at the same time
I can't even walk in a straight line
I've been lying in the dark no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine

She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there

It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have, ohh yeah
'Cause I can't believe that it's over

You've hit your low, you've lost control and you want me back
You may not believe me but I gave you all I have
Undress, confess that you're still mine
I roll around in a bed full of tears, and
I'm still lying in the dark no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine

This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there, yeah

Just a feeling that I have (ohh)
No I can't believe that it's over now
It's just a feeling (babe)
Just a feeling that I have, ohh

So much to say, it's not the way she does her hair
It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes
And in my darkest day when she refused to run away
From love she tried so hard to save...

It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have (ohh)
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have

just another girl,the killers,"Step out into the Indian dust
I can feel the cracks in my spirit
They're starting to bust
Drive by your house, nobody's home
I'm trying to tell myself that I'm better off alone

All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And of all my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world
She's just another girl

Another girl

I went to see a fortuneteller
That was a trip
Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip
I can't believe you're out there
Flying with somebody else, uh-huh

Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye
I got an invitation, but I didn't reply
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
And give him all of my love

All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world
She's just another girl

I could be reeling 'em in left and right
Something's got a hold on me, tonight

Well, maybe all of my friends should confront
The fact that I don't want

Another girl

All of my friends say I should move on
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
She's just another girl

Now why can't I sleep at night?
And why don't the moon look right
The sounds up, the TV's on
And it's a great big world

The things you need in me

just like anyone,soul asylum,"She walks into the outhouse
The cold night breathes into her face
The flies are standin' still now
The moon it spills through the place

And she starts wonderin' what its like to be
Liked by everyone and like everyone be just
Like anyone and just wants to be so
Just like anyone, just like anyone

She reaches through the darkness
Her fingers touch the porcelain seat
She spins and pulls her pants down
The cold air holds her like a thief

And she starts wonderin what they mean
Do they just mean to be mean
And thinkin' bout the scene
Do they just want to be seen
Try not to seem so just like anyone,
Just like anyone

The door comes screechin' open
She walks into the evening air
She disappears in the darkness
All's left, the faint smell of her hair

She starts wonderin' what its like to be
Liked by everyone and like everyone
Be just like anyone and just wants to be so
Just like anyone and wonderin what they mean
Do they just mean to be mean and thinkin' bout
The scene do they just want to be seen
Try not to seem so just like anyone

I don't mind you comin' here

Can you tell me how much bleeding
It takes to fill a word with meaning?
And how much, how much death
It takes to give a slogan breath?
And how much, how much, how much flame
Gives light to a name
For the hollow darkness
In which nations dress?
Everybody
Loves to see
Justice done
On somebody else

Everybody's seen the things they've seen
We all have to live with what we've been
When they say charity begins at home
They're not just talking about a toilet and a telephone
Got to search the silence of the soul's wild places
For a voice that can cross the spaces
These definitions that we love create --
These names for heaven, hero, tribe and state
Everybody
Loves to see
Justice done
On somebody else"
justified,life of agony,"If you're looking to tell it
All and save your soul, I know what you can do
You can start by letting me in
So we could begin to mend these salted wounds

You sacrifice, you sacrifice and if we bleed it's justified
And I can't look into your face, it's been harder than you've known
And I can't find a single place that these demons haven't shown
So go to sleep, I need to be alone

Don't ya, don't ya wanna tell someone
What you have done and get it off your chest?
How long can you carry this load
Until it explodes in your fucking face?

We sacrifice, we sacrifice and if we bleed it's justified
And I can't look into your face, it's been harder than you've known
And I can't find a single place that these demons haven't shown
So go to sleep, I need to be alone

k-pax,kirlian camera,"A sunny morning, almost spring,
Your drowsy smile grey like a kiss
Some weary lover would have given
To a glorious jewel from the abyss.

Where are the hours of your rising night...?
Worn-out and incredibly bright...

And then again we both wake up
Saying hello to our own world
A dust like gold was everywhere
Filling the room, the reborn air
Unseen a spetter was waiting
For that invincible soldier.

He had my eyes and my cruel heart
My secret days, my chilling flames
Was near to you while staying apart
Watching his days lost in a game
Made for some ghosts looking like him
But I can swear he had a dream.

A sunny morning, maybe March
And now must turn my face to you,
I must realize what is that arch
Enemy looking for your blue
But willing and merciful arms.

Don't say a word.
The world has gone."

And place me in the sky

But through your kaleidoscope (Kaleidoscope)

'Cause you show me
The world as it could be
Through your kaleidoscope (Kaleidoscope)
It's beautiful

A tingle travels up my spine
A cluster of colors and twine
As we melt
Into one

The world as it could be

karma,angie stone,"Yeah
You know there's really no need to
Stress or trip over getting even
Because my life is gilded and grounded
And I really believe that karma in itself avenges us
Feel me (Yeah)
Dig it

Tried so many times to make some sense of it
Unsure about the people in the mix
My sacred intention, my moment to mention
Just what it is I was called here to do

- Love somebody
Give somebody
Teach somebody
Touch somebody

And when the good gets misunderstood
The repercussions can be cruel
And that ain't cool
Karma will avenge you

I've often seen the faces of despair
And been in situations people don't care
They take advantage of your every move
That ain't cool cuz I'm no fool
They monopolize your time
Try to redesign your mind
The very time they use to find
You're in this love for sharing

To me the world is stingy with love, everybody for self
And when you finally find love, then people hate you to death
A constant struggle, between you and your mental muscles
Emotional paranoia, with feelin' nobody loves ya
No one to reach to, gravity seen you
You the one in church that the preachers will preach to
And you're prayer just for confession, more blessings
Try to get protection from manic depression and keep steppin'
From mean?? impressions, the supper comes with dressin'
Attached with life and karma and it's own lessons
And that's faith and love peace and trust
And never participate with the evil in us
And life ain't fair when you feel wear and tear
Remember God don't put more into you than you can bear
And believe that to death
A long journey don't start 'till the first step
And that's life"
kashmir,led zeppelin,"Oh, let the Sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, baby, I've been flying
No, yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Oh, oh, yeah, I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying
Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the Sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find where I've been
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer Moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When moving through Kashmir
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh no
Oh, when I'm on
When I'm on my way, yeah
When I see
When I see the way, you'll stay, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, when I'm down

The path we least resist

Got a different method, but I still can bring the pain, so
Y'all all get the same flow, I got that insane flow
I ain't shocking, catching, never really in my range, though
It's a half angle, high fried pain, go
All prime time, Imma let the bass bang low
Are you fucking lames go, aiming at my name, no
Careful what you shoot for, 'cause you might hit what you aim for

Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

First, we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

Wait! I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

Then Mr. Oogie Boogie man

Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased, I do declare

That he will cook him rare
Wheeee!

I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then
Knock three times and when he anwers
Sandy Claws will be no more

You're so stupid, think now
If we blow him up into smithereens
We may lose some pieces

And the Jack will beat us black and green

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town

He'll be so pleased by our success

That he'll reward us too, I bet

Perhaps he'll make his special brew

Of snake and spider stew
Ummm!

We're his little henchmen
And we take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb

I'm not the dumb one

You're no fun

Shut up!

Make me

I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide

Until his curiousity

Entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, beat him with a stick
Lock him for ninety years, see what makes him tick

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then throw away the key"

Go ahead, stab a friend, tell him that I'm back, bitch
Earl leave bastards with milkiest asses
Take a firm standin', nine on the tracklist
Earl half the reason the reviews fantastic
Niggas gettin' comfy on the couch, I ain't havin' it
Kickin' gluteus maximus, killin' niggas on accident

Just watch, I'ma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'ma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'ma kill 'em all
Just watch, off 'em

Off 'em, no off days, no debates, bitch
Box logo switchblade and cocaine
In my back pocket, take Jade on vacation
The hotel switch from Heartbreak to Bates quick
Rippin' out braids with bare hands amazes
The crowd go crazy, hands raised, I'm laced with
Swag by the eighth in case you wanna taste it
Faggots wear Prada, Satan wears RMK shit
Hell's angel, crack Christ 'cross the face
With erasers and use Based God as his replacement
Super Saiyan with ruthless slayings
Eat puss', sweet puss' got my tooth decayin'

Just watch, I'ma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'ma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'ma kill 'em all
Just watch (Off 'em)

Now pan the cameras back to me and Pamela's
Amateur threesome with Hannah Montana's manager
And Miley feedin' me sandwiches for my stamina
And Santa's in the back laughin' cause my back's crampin' up
Mrs. Claus trippin' balls, think she had enough
And by enough, I mean we dope as fuck, she had a gram of us
Flyer than your man because I'm lampin' up
At the airport smokin' hash with all the fuckin' baggage handlers
Flowin' like the motherfuckin' aqueducts
Odd Future Wolf Gang, fag damagers, bitch
Eat a dick"
kind of girl,low,"Half your life you kept it in
Born without a stomach
Now the thread around you spins

No, you're not that kind of girl
No, you could've had the world

Every time they lift you up
Every time more thread to cut
Seems like you've been cut enough

No, you're not that kind of girl
No, you could've had the world

Now lesser things
Pull the strings
Of priests and kings

No, you're not that kind of girl
No, you could've had the world"
king kong,daniel johnston,"They shot him down
They shot him down
They thought he was a monster
But he was the king

They came to his island
And they brought her with them
They wanted to get his picture
But they were surprised by his enormous size

And when he saw the woman
He took her without question
Because after all
He was the king

And he loved the woman
He loved the way she looked
But she wouldn't stop
Her screaming

But he loved the woman
And he fought a Tyrannosaurus Rex
It was a bloody battle
But he fought it for his woman

And he climbed up a mountain
And he looked around
Some kind of forest
With all those dinosaurs

And he stripped his woman
He stripped her bare
But there was a pterodactyl
There!

And then a hero
Came and took his woman
And they fell off the mountain
Into some water

And then later
He came looking for his woman
But they were waiting
And they threw a bomb

And they tied him
And they took him across the ocean
And they chained him
And put him in the show

But when he saw his woman
He broke loose
And everyone fled in terror
And he was looking for her

And he overturned the train
He was looking in the street
And then he found her in her apartment

And He climbed up the Empire State building
It was like a phallic Symbol
And he took his woman
To the top of that towering temple

And he climbed up and looked around
Some kind of city
With all those skyscrapers
And all the cars

Just him and his screaming woman
They were finally alone
He loved his woman
You could see it in his eyes
His great big eyes

He loved his woman
From the moment he saw her
He was all choked up inside

But when the airplanes came
He was soon to die
But he hung on long enough to set his woman down
And make sure
She was safe

And as the bullets pierced
He looked at her so sincere
Before he fell
Because he loved his woman

They shot him down
They shot him down
They thought he was a monster
But he was the king

Who killed the monkey
Who killed the monkey
'Twas beauty
That killed the beast

And Willis O'Brien died
A tragic death
There wasn't much
That he had left

And Ray Harryhousen said
That when Willis died
That's when the king
Was really dead

They shot him down
They shot him down
They thought he was a monster
But he was the king

But he was the king
But he was the king
But he was the king"
king of the hill,minutemen,"What is peace
To the people
Who work the land
And die in wars?
It was learned in a game
That was played by us all
Who held the top of the hill
From the rest was called the king

And I can't believe it all
Was good for humankind
Is it peace
To point the guns?
Is it war
To fire the guns?
We would run with all of our might
Push the king off to take the hill
And to learn who was king
And who makes the better serf

I can't believe it all
Was good for humankind
And I have to read the lies
Between the lines

Believe in this
We are part
Of a whole we call the earth

I can't believe it all
Was good for humankind
And I have to read the lies
Between the lines"

Y no de excusas vivo yo

Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso

No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas

Oye, mi negra, no me castigues más
Porque, allá afuera, sin ti no tengo paz
Yo sólo soy un hombre arrepentido
Soy como el ave que vuelve a su nido

Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Y es que no estoy hecho de cartón
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo

Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón

¡Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!
¡Ay!, todo lo que he hecho por ti
Fue una tortura perderte
Y me duele tanto que sea así
Sigue llorando perdón
Yo, yo no voy
A llorar por ti"

Irrst Du umher, dann siehst Du das Licht So sehr Du auch rennst,

Im Labyrinth der Sinne - Nur wer beflügelt wird sich selbst des Rätsels Lösung sein
Nur wer das Ziel kennt, erahnt einen Weg
Und der es erfand, hält Dein Schicksal in der Hand
Doch sollte es sich selbst erfinden, ständig wachsen, vorwärts winden
Muß es unendlich sein und Du für Deine Ewigkeit allein
Irgendwer hat am Rad der Zeit gedreht
Und wie Du Dich auch hetzt, Du bist immer zu spät
Die Sinne geschärft und von Verzweiflung geplagt
Ein Verwirrspiel der Sinne, hast Dich selbst gejagt

So lately we've been ignoring all his stories as we smile and nod
and let him simply do what he does
So watch out

And everybody's got the same story:
We never wanted him here
He showed up anyway
He never would leave us alone
We never wanted him here
He showed up anyway
But maybe that's ok

Soon this gentleman was barking louder when his biting harder didn't earn him respect
But lately we've been too proud to admit that we all might miss him just a bit

What did we do?

Keep those demons at bay, don't give up on forever
You can make it better

Lady Lazarus, you've risen and there's no way back
Lady Lazarus, you're stranded 'til the sky turns black

You say that you laugh so much that you cried
You said so much more than you denied
To use the power that you have gained
Give it back and give up your fame
Keep those demons at bay, don't give up on forever
You can make it better

Lady Lazarus, you've risen and there's no way back
Lady Lazarus, you're stranded 'til the sky turns black

You said so much more than you denied
You secretly wished to be crucified
You said so much more than you denied
You secretly wished to be crucified
Crucified
Crucified
Crucified
Crucified"
lady madonna,paul mccartney,"Lady Madonna,
Children at your feet.
Wonders how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money,
When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven-sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.
Lady Madonna,
Baby at your breast.
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna,
Lying on the bed.
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didn't come.
Thursday night your stockings needed mending.
See how they run.
Lady Madonna,
Children at your feet.
Wonders how you manage to make ends meet."

The neighbours complain about the noises above
But she only cums when she's on top

My therapist said not to see you no more
She said you're like a disease without any cure
She said I'm so obsessed that I'm becoming a bore, oh no
Ah, you think you're so pretty

Caught your hand inside the till
Slammed your fingers in the drawer
Fought with kitchen knives and skewers
Dressed me up in women's clothes
Messed around with gender roles
Line my eyes and call me pretty

Moved out of the house, so you moved next door
I locked you out, you cut a hole in the wall
I found you sleeping next to me, I thought I was alone
You're driving me crazy, when are you coming home?

lake shore drive,aliotta haynes jeremiah,"There's a road I'd like to tell you about, lives in my home town
Lake Shore Drive, the road is called and it'll take you up or down
From rats on up to riches, fifteen minutes you can fly
Pretty blue lights along the way, help you right on by
And the blue lights shining with a heavenly grace, help you right on by

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive heading into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound

And it starts up north from Hollywood, water on the driving side
Concrete mountains rearing up, throwing shadows just about five
Sometimes you can smell the green if your mind is feeling fine
There ain't no finer place to be, than running Lake Shore Drive
And there's no peace of mind, or place you see, than riding on Lake Shore Drive

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive, heading into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound

And it's Friday night and you're looking clean
Too early to start the rounds
A ten minute ride from the Gold Coast back, make sure you're pleasure bound
And it's four o'clock in the morning and all of the people have gone away
Just you and your mind and Lake Shore Drive, tomorrow is another day
And the sunshine's fine in the morning time, tomorrow is another day

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive, heading into town
Just snaking on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound"

In the Land of the Dead

Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

last call,mae,"Hello, grab your bag and let's go.
More out of place than anything you know.
Like an opera at a disco.
When all you wanted was a rock show, tonight.
These lights, are they hanging in the distance?
Did they glimmer for an instant?
When they're shining do you feel all right?
Know love, you were looking good tonight. tonight.

This is the last call. OH-OH-OH
Too long to list it.
Please don't you miss it.
Don't give up and let them hold you down
And when they tell you no,
We could burn this town.

Scream, waking from a bad dream.
Don't think anything is what it seem s.
Can't you figure out what this means?
Don't sit back and keep your hands clean, today.
We'll say maybe we can find a new way.
Or create another great cliche.
Storms are coming, why don't we play?
Instead of sitting, dancing in the rain, today.

This is the last call. OH-OH-OH
Too long to list it.
Please don't you miss it.
Don't give up and let them hold you down
And when they tell you no,
We could burn this town.

So long, they tried to tell you that you don't belong.
So, I guess we'll have to prove them wrong.
Pretty soon we'll hear them sing a long.
Ain't it funny that it's our song?
So long.

This is the last call. OH-OH-OH
Too long to list it.
Please don't you miss it.
Don't give up and let them hold you down
And when they tell you no.
We could burn this town."
last days of disco,yo la tengo,"Saw you at a party, you asked me to dance
Said music was great for dancing
I don't really dance much, but this time I did
I was glad that I did, this time

And the song said: ""Let's be happy"". I was happy
It never made me happy, before
And the song says: ""Don't be lonely"". It makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely, more and more

Where I belong
Where I belong

I wasn't dressed right. I rarely am
You told me that you didn't care
I laughed as you wobbled on your platform shoes
You laughed when I called Andrea true Anita Ward

And the song said: ""Let's be happy"". And I was happy
It never made me happy, before
And the song says: ""Don't be lonely"". It makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely, more and more

Where I belong
Where I belong

And the song said: ""Let's be happy"". I was happy
It never made me happy, before
It asked: ""Do you remember?"". I remember
Remember like it wasn't long ago

And the song says: ""Don't be lonely"". It makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely, more and more

Where I belong
Where I belong
Where I belong

last day,teedra moses,"I Pray that the sun shines in the windows
Like it did on thursday
Wont sleep the night before ill be up just wondering my life
I would call on my peeps
Early in the morning to come later for a party
Id spend the day with my angels at the beach
Listening to the shore
That would be the way theyd remember me

If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
If this was my last day
If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
Oooo earth

Pray that its a saturday is a better day for me to go on
I can be free on the weekends
I use to live for the weekends (ooooo)
Call you up and acknowledge you to come through
And we do things do things over and over and over again
Just when you blow me out (you blow me out)
Thats when my heart would stop

If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
If it was my last day if it was my last day here
If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
If it was my last day here on earth
Ooooo earth

Never really thought about it
So carefree
Young and just doing my own thing
Really i be on bended knee (really id be on bended knee)
Praying that he opens his gates for me

Spend the day with my angels at the beach
Listening to the shore
That would be the way theyd remember me

If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
Would you remember me? (ooooooo)
(If i was gone) if this was my last day on earth (earth earth earth)
Would you remember me
If it was my last day
If it was my last day (oooooo)"

last goodbye,jeff buckley,"This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over

Just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for
More than you'll ever know

This is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face
Why can't we overcome this wall
Baby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at all

Kiss me
Please kiss me
Kiss me out of desire, baby
Not consolation

Oh, you know it makes me so angry
'Cause I know that in time
I'll only make you cry
This is our last goodbye
Ooh no no no no

Ooh uhm
Ooh

Did you say, ""No, this can't happen to me""
And did you rush to your phone to call?
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind saying
""Maybe you didn't know at all""

You didn't know him at all
You didn't know
Oh you didn't know

The bells out in the church tower chime
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memory
Offer signs that it's over
It's over"
last kiss,pearl jam,"Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead

I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget, the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream, that I heard last

Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people standing all around
Something warm flowin' through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night

I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love, that I knew I had missed
And now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night

Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world"
last man standing,duran duran,"Now an unexpected peace comes to the day
As the howling and the fighting dies away
When the hanging dust is clearing from the air

He does not look back
He's the last man standing on the track
You can't hold him down
You can't hold him back
The last man standing on the track
He does not look down
He does not look back
He's the last man standing on the track
You can't hold him down
You can't hold him back
He is sorry for the wrong that he has done
And he cries out for the anger born so long
All the cuts and bruises suffered in whose name?
Oh, but now is not the time to face his shame
He's the last man standing on the track
He does not look down
He does not look back
He's the last man standing on the track

last night,az yet,"Last night, you were so into it
You told me secrets that you've never told a soul
You were so nervous and, yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine as you taste mine
I kissed your lips, you felt my body slip into your soul
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night, I was inside of you
Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon, the mountains, and the rivers
I saw Heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and so very innocent
We talked of memories, our favourite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love

Deep in the night, right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight in your soul
You felt incredible, I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night, I was inside of you
Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon, the mountains, and the rivers
I saw Heaven when I made sweet love to you

(Sunlight) sunlight, red, red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
(Moonlight) moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes, and I'm so, I'm so in love

Last night, I was inside of you
Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon, the mountains and the rivers
I saw Heaven when I made sweet love to you, baby

Last night, I was inside of you
Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon, the mountains, and the rivers

last orders,cock sparrer,"The first time that I saw her it was getting kinda late
I'd already had a skinful but I asked her for a date
She said yes, I had a drink to celebrate
Time for one last round
I know the road to romance has some very rocky paths
So next night I was careful and I stuck to drinking half's
In an hour, in an alley with our drawers around our calf's
Time for one last round
The bells, the bells,
So loud a man can't think
The bells, the bells,
Is there time for another drink?
Fifteen minutes later we were back inside the pub
She told me I was wonderful, she said she was in love
I said ""thank you darling, two large brandies guv""
There's time for one last round
The bells, the bells,
So loud a man can't think
The bells, the bells,
Is there time for another drink?
Four pints of lager later things went from bad to worse
She came back from the toilet caught me going through her purse
She said ""forget the taxi, you're gonna need a hearse""
There's time for one last round
One tequila, two tequila, three tequila four
I knew I wasn't drunk I had a good grip on the floor
I puckered up to kiss her but she punched me in the jaw

Were riding in a seaplane before it disappeared
Who goes to hell and who goes surfing?
Who's gonna be a meal for the urchins now?

It's going down
It's going down
It's going down
Yeah, it's going down

Last time, I had dinner with a racist
Last time, I just fell asleep
Last time, I got a little bit wasted
And dreamed of a plane
Crashing into the sea

Well, if I go down in a plane, I'll go to hell
But I'll leave all my shit to my friends in a will
You could have my Crown Vic and you can have my debt
You could have my weakness and my regrets
But sweetheart, take your dumptruck memories and
Bury them in the cold, cold ground
I've come back for some dead man's loving
You'll need to come, I'll need to throttle down

Last time, I got a little bit wasted
And dreamed of a plane
Crashing into the sea

Last time, I couldn't make you come
Last time, you didn't fake me out
Last time, I got a little bit wasted
But this time, I don't think you'll mind

Salesmen and racists and football stars
All hanging out at the hotel bar
Telling those jokes, clearing their throats
Drinking their dinner and smoking my dope
Well, I will smile and I'll backslap
Laugh at those jokes
And gladly shake their hands"
lately,david gray,"If the sky weren't lit, had to find my place
I would see your face in the door
If the sun would glint on the time we spent
All the time that ain't no more
Chase the broken hearts in the vacant lots
See that fruit that rots on the tree
Try to turn my head, leave it all for dead
But it's in my mind always

Honey, Lately, I've been weighed down
Load on my mind
Honey Lately I've been weighed down
Load on my mind

Someone tell me, where did it go?
Darlin', I'm damned if I know
I seen that look in your eye
No one ever gave it a chance
I could've seen in advance
You saw it all in a glance

And Goodbye, Goodbye.

Take a salty kiss from this cup of bliss
Watching new light twist on the bridge
Try to paint it red
Leave it all for dead
But it's in my mind always

Honey, Lately, I've been weighed down
Load on my mind
Honey Lately I've been weighed down
Load on my mind

Someone tell me, where did it go?
Darlin', I'm damned if I know
I seen that look in your eye
No one ever gave it a chance

Your heart broke when the party died
Drape your arms around me and softly say

You can't cry
Get your glad rags on and let's sing along
To that lonely song

You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark
Ooh, Laura, you're more than a superstar
And in this horror show
I've got to tell you so
Ooh, Laura, you're more than a superstar

You say that you're stuck in a pale blue dream
And your tears feel hot on my bed sheets
Drape your arms around me and softly say
""Can we dance upon the tables again?""

You can't cry
Get your glad rags on and let's sing along
To that lonely song

You're the train that crashed my heart

You'll be famous for longer than them
Your name is tattooed on every boy's skin
Ooh, Laura, you're more than a superstar

Until the break of day
Let me see you make him smile

His clothes are dirty, but his-
His hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's
Ever seen

Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile

Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love?
When he's standing, in front of you

lay me down,sam smith,"Yes, I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you

Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming
It's much too strong

Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here
If I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

You told me not to cry when you were gone

It's much too strong

Can I lay by your side?

Went through a bunch of bullshit while I was paying my dues
They say my music make a gangsta wanna pop somethin
Well tell them niggas they can pop this stop frontin me

Just cuz I like ice don't compare me to Lil Wayne

See Buck been shot, but not more than 50
I don't dance, what I look like signin wit Diddy?
I got plans, grenades and the G-Unit wit me
And on command, we spray give a fuck who we hittin
What's in my hand? A tan bout a hundred and sixty
Hollow tips, four-fifths with the rubber grip
Crips & Bloods they show me love like I'm claimin a set
These industry niggas know they better pay me my check
I get a kick outta seein these broke ass rappers
Ten people showed up that's why your show got cancelled
50 whatever they did to the kid is handled
Niggas callin for these features but they get no answers

I'm sellin tickets for a first class trip to a hospital folder
So please keep talkin
So we can spread your feet, and have you on your boulevard C-Walkin
The birds keep hawkin, why?
Cuz I'm burnin every CD and Walkman from D.C. to Boston
I laugh at a snotty chick, bitch I don't argue
I'll leave a print in your ass from a karate kick
Them niggas that I be wit, got guns on the big body tip
And if they pull out you'd prolly shit
Jewelry got me in heavy gray pictures
Plus I light up trees like every day's Christmas

Shit! Pull That Back!"
laying low,danielle bradbery,"I wanna put on a record
I never heard before
Shut off my phone and lock the door
Drink every world like a bottle of wine
Till my soul's so drunk it's passed out on the floor

Tonight I'm laying low
I'm laying low
In a world that moves so fast
We forget to take it slow
Don't wanna look in the mirror
Wonder where did she go
So I'm taking my time
Tonight I'm laying low

Don't wanna put on any makeup
Don't wanna brush my hair
Leave these high heels off my feet and just not care
Wanna dance to the rhythm of the raindrops
Falling on the rooftop now
They're easy to miss when everything's so loud

Tonight I'm laying low
I'm laying low
In a world that moves so fast
We forget to take it slow
Don't wanna look in the mirror
Wonder where did she go
So I'm taking my time
Tonight I'm laying low

Wanna take a deep breathe in
And just let it go

Tonight I'm laying low
I'm laying low
In a world that moves so fast
We forget to take it slow

lazarus,porcupine tree,"As the cheerless towns pass my window
I can see a washed out moon through the fog
And then a voice inside my head
Breaks the analogue And says

""Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding
From out of your soul""

I survived against the will
Of my twisted folk
But in the deafness of my world
The silence broke And said

Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding
From out of your soul

Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding
From out of your soul

My David don't you worry

This cold world is not for you
So rest your head upon me
I have strength to carry you
Ghosts of the twenties rising Golden summers just holding you
Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding
From out of your soul
Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding
From out of your soul
Come to us Lazarus
It's time for you to go"
lazy afternoon,the roots,"Chorus
------

It's a lazy afternoon
(Summertime, as I recline, lay back and relax, let the sun shine)

Verse 1
-------

[Black thought]

Consider this a message to my mellow in the front seat
Of the jeep pumpin' beats for your rump
In the summertime I'm risin' to the shine at 12: 20
Ghetto streets are sunny, niggas is gettin' money
It's mad hot, and what I got to do I'm not sure of
I call up maura, this dip I know from bora bora
Was rappin' for a second about what I reckoned that i

Was doin' at six, she was invitin' me to the flicks
That I'm with, blew a kiss  now I'm in the shower
I meant the bath in which I simmer for half an hour
Then got drier, put on attire to inspire
Hit my dresser for numbers of women that I admire
Laid around and lounged 'til around two
Then I got up and ate, drank a brew and caught a page from the crew
Sayin' where ya at? later, meet us up at the plat
Bring a sack, ayo it's saturday, it's gonna be fat
Now it's 3: 37 and I still ain't left the rest
Electric relaxation from a tribe called quest
With the boom, tokin', smokin', coolin' out
As I parlay in my room 'cause it's a lazy afternoon

Other verses as verse 1, with the following variations:

Verse 2: this dip I knew from bora bora
'Cause it's a lazy aaaaaahh! (dental style:-)

Verse 3:  I'm in the shower
A page from my crew
Bring a sack, nigga, it's saturday"

Just sittin' down by the radio

It's a crazy day, i've got a thing that i wanna try with you
Now baby, don't go away
Please don't spoil my lazy day.
No, you don't have to think about nothing to do

Oh, i'm gonna make a real funny walk a-like a brand new dime
No, i don't have no money but i always got plenty of time.

lazy day,beach fossils,"I felt the grass
On my chest in the open field
And I knew there was
Nothing left for me to feel

Airplanes above
Cross the sky
Under the haze
In the morning time
We didn't think
About our days

The wind was blowing
Through our hair
As we lied down
And we could feel
Under our backs
That the Earth was round

Lazy today
Lazy tonight
And later on
All we had to do
Was nothing at all
Under the sun"
lazy eye,goo goo dolls,"The world spins 'round the secret lives
Of everyone that needs to hide
A cheap parade of endless lies
Filters through this lazy eye

And I don't believe in signs
No, I don't believe your lies

Caught in the breakdown
Caught in the breakdown
Caught in the breakdown
Caught in the breakdown

Lose yourself in no one's life
Trapped in nowhere's empty light
Words like fists that tear you down
Crash before we hit the ground

And I don't believe in signs
No, I don't believe your lies

Caught in the breakdown
Caught in the breakdown
Caught in the breakdown
Caught in the breakdown

And I don't believe in signs
No, I don't believe your lies
No, I don't believe your lies

Caught in the breakdown
Caught in the breakdown

Caught in the breakdown

lazy river,hoagy carmichael,"Up a lazy river by the old mill run
Lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger awhile in the shade of the tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me

You know, before your sister was born
This is what your Mama did for a living
Music opened a whole new world to me
No matter how bad I feel, no matter how sad or sick I am
I just touched these keys and poof, like magic
I always seemed to feel better
I've always known you had talent, Bobbie
This piano is for you, Charlie worked hard for it
See God wouldn't have made you suffer so much
If you weren't gonna make up for it later

How happy you can be
Up a lazy river with me

Throw away your troubles, baby
Dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river with me

From the halfway mark

To be a star, a big star
You gotta be talented obviously
You gotta be tenacious, have charisma
But most importantly, you've gotta have it
A great intangible and you've got it all, Bobbie
You're gonna be bigger than Sinatra
I'd settle for a little Jolson Mama, Mama, Mama

Ah ah ah, there are blue skies up above
Forever long as we're in love
We'll be up a lazy river
Up a crazy lazy river
Up a lazy river
I ain't goin' your way
Get out of my way
Up a lazy river with me"

Are you feeling lost and lonely?

Carrying the world on your shoulders

Ever more as you get older
You needn't be, oh you needn't be

Hoping for a better day

It's the same, so hard to explain
A million pounds won't be enough
To make me stare back at your face

Every night, every day

A million pounds won't be enough
To make me stare back at your face
That's what I left behind"
legacy,nichole nordeman,"I don't mind if you've got something nice to say about me
And I enjoy an accolade like the rest
And you can take my picture and hang it in a gallery
Of all the Who's Who's and So-and-So's
That used to be the best at such-and-such
It wouldn't matter much

I won't lie, it feels all right to see your name in lights
We all need an ""atta-boy"" or ""atta-girl""
But in the end I'd like to hang my hat on more besides
The temporary trappings of this world

I want to leave a legacy
How will they remember me?
Did I choose to love?
Did I point to You enough
To make a mark on things
I want to leave an offering
A child of mercy and grace
Who blessed Your name unapologetically
And leave that kind of legacy

I don't have to look too far or too long a while
To make a lengthy list of all that I enjoy
It's an accumulating trinket and a treasure pile
Where moth and rust, thieves and such
Will soon enough destroy

I want to leave a legacy
How will they remember me?
Did I choose to love?
Did I point to You enough
To make a mark on things
I want to leave an offering
A child of mercy and grace
Who blessed Your name unapologetically
And leave that kind of legacy

Not well-traveled, not well-read
Not well-to-do or well-bred
Just want to hear instead
Well done, good and faithful one

I want to leave a legacy
How will they remember me?
Did I choose to love?
Did I point to You enough
To make a mark on things
I want to leave an offering
A child of mercy and grace
Who blessed Your name unapologetically
And leave that kind of legacy

I don't mind if you've got something nice to say about me"
legion,agonoize,"Wir sind Legionen!

Hast du geglaubt das würde ewig weitergehen
Und die Menschheit wär zu dumm um deine Lügen zu verstehen?
Dann wird es Zeit, dass du begreifst,
Dass du deine Macht verlierst,
Wenn du Andersdenken strafst
Und mit der Angst der Menschen spielst.

Spürst du denn nicht, dass diesmal alles anders ist
Und diese Welt nicht mehr deine Sprache spricht?
Spürst du denn nicht, dass du nicht mehr allmächtig bist?
Spürst du denn nicht, dass deine Macht am Ende ist?

Wir sind Legionen und wir sind nicht Allein.
Wir sind Legionen und werden demnach Viele sein.
Wir sind die Angst und bringen Dunkel in das Licht.
Wir sind die Furcht, die deine scheinbar heile Welt zerfrisst.

Wir sind Legionen... Legionen... Legionen

Hast du geglaubt du könntest tun was dir gefällt
Und dass ein freier Wille nichts in deiner Glaubenswelt mehr zählt?

Wir sind der Sturm deiner Selbst der Dreck den du verschmähst.
Wir sind der Schatten deines Seins und werden dennoch Viele sein.

Spürst du denn nicht, dass diesmal alles anders ist
Und diese Welt nicht mehr deine Sprache spricht?
Spürst du denn nicht, dass du nicht mehr allmächtig bist?

lemonade,braids,"I don't want to go out there,
I don't want to know what you're wearing.
There are black diamonds in your eyes,
And just so you know your skin is scaling.

Have you fought all those dragons yet?
They're their sleeping in my backyard
They're just looking out for no one.
Except to smoke and have some good fun
With their dogs and wives and new sons,
And they probably never will hug
'Cause she's never really found love.
Just a woman who will always love.
Just a unhappy with a man

And what I, and what I found is that we
We're all just sleeping around.

His daughter used to come here
With her daughter and her husband
Now no one sees her husband
'Cause her ass has caught the harvest
And her pants have got a good fill
I know the suns beneath the window sill.

Well I was joking with my lemonade
I told him to get fucked and then get laid.
Now what do you say to a man who's got no taste,
Who's really got no potential
Except to procreate so inessential.

And what I, and what I found is that we
We're all just sleeping around.

All we really want to do is love."

I'll break my life for a song
And two lives that stoop to notice mine
I know I will say goodbye
But a fraction of this life
I would give anything, anytime

You could kill a life with words
So, how would it feel
Si nos vies sont si fragiles
Words are mysteries
Les mots des sentiments
Les mots d'amour, un temple

If one swept the world away
One could touch the universe
I will tell you how the sun rose high
We could, with a word, become one

Et pour tous ces mots qui blessent
Il y a ceux qui nous caressent
Qui illuminent, qui touchent l'infini
Même si le néant existe
For a fraction of this life
I will give anything, anytime

Dans les eaux troubles d'un miroir,

Que tu t'es mis tout près du coeur
Le smoking des temps de rigueur,
Un papillon noir

Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

Sometimes
Some lies
Can take a minute
To fully realize
His tears
Your eyes
30 seconds to apologize

You give it one more chance
Just like the time before
But he already know you'd give a hundred more
Until that night in bed
You wake up in a sweat
You're racing to the door
Can't take it anymore

I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned, oh-oh
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

Life perfect, ain't perfect
If you don't know what the struggle's for
Falling down ain't falling down
If you don't cry when you hit the floor
It's called the past 'cause I'm getting past
And I ain't nothing like I was before
You ought to see me now

Yes, I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned

lessons,damiera,"Let's stay til the fox takes life to flight
It makes sense til you just adjust the lights
It frustrates, it frustrates and lessens lessons
Crawl around til your knees drop out to shreds
And mind leaves you as we're all dressed up to go
It illustrates, illustrates how lessons lessen
I'll stand wide awake
Cause this feels like
Home act asleep and drawn in with all the things that never lasted
Attracting hope dissolving through time
Dissect your fears neglected by the sunlight
Obsessions made from indulgent waste-of-times
Open up this door
Offensive be the lifeless with all direction aside
Stay away from this life signal
While we plan escape from whats meaningful
What life has always left us with
Gracefully flooding ability
The lesson is deafening almost feel i could
Gracefully flooding ability
The lesson is deafening almost feel i could
I forgot this feeling it just hit
I forgot this feeling it just hit
Dissect your fears neglected by the sunlight
Obsessions made from indulgent waste-of-times
Open up this door
Offensive be the lifeless with all direction aside
Now we collide and decide if we were meant to stand
Like stones sounds never found out of context
A conversation fit
For the end"
let down,christopher o'riley,"Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so so disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

One day I'm going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and...

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Let down again
Let down again
Let down again

You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back
And one day...
I am going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and...

A time in everyones life
When nothing seems to go your way
When nothing seems to turn out right

There may come a time
You just can't seem to find your place
For every door you open
Seems like you get two slammed in your face

Thats when you need someone
Someone that you, you can call
When all your faith is gone
It feels like you can't go on

Let it be me
Let it be me
If it's a friend that you need
Let it be me
Let it be me

Feels like you're always coming up last
Pockets full of nothin', aint got no cash
No matter where you turn, you aint got no place to stand
You reach out for something and they slap your hand

I remember all too well
Just how it feels to be all alone
You feel like you'd give anything
For just a little place you can call your own

Thats when you need someone
Someone that you, you can call
When all your faith is gone
Feels like you can't go on

Out of your mind
You start to feel afraid
It is the price you pay
To get the thrill
You need to stay alive

Let it burn!

Between the cuts and cries
You'll find a way to die
Just take a sip
And twist it like a knife
A city full of sound
Too late to turn around
You need to flee the light
To save your life

You like when it hurts?
Let it burn!
Let it burn!

You ain't sure what came first
Was it your flame or thirst?
You need to please them both
To put you out
Another wasted youth
You thought you'd seen the truth
You need to find a voice
To help you shout

You like when it hurts?

We can't talk though we keep trying
But as long as the love is strong
Let it go
Just let it go

Integrity, identity
And all the ghosts inside of me
Tell me there's so much I still don't know

If today you were almost dyin'
Well tomorrow you might be flyin'
We sure got our ways to go
Let it go
Gotta let it

We finally reached the day
The ties start to break away
I lied to your face, I know
I'll never let him go

Don't hang ideals on me
I need to know how good it could be
I just want to try and stand alone
I wanna let it go
I wanna let it go

Girl, tomorrow you might be flyin'
So many ways to go
Gotta let it go"
let it rain,tilly and the wall,"""Get into the groove boy you've got to prove your love to me""
Played on the radio as we drove down south to see our families
You were lying there in the passenger chair sound asleep
I could recall a time when evenings were bright and thick with love
And all the city streets and their lights they were so mysterious
Oh life it was so wonderful it would shine just like fire
How we sat on the backs of our cars and laughed into the morning
I thought you'd come and go
I never thought you would stay
And I'm sorry if I tried to push you away
But the edges they fold and you suddenly find you are buried beneath
A blanket of snow you had no idea was even falling
Now you're sitting on a ouch inside your home feeling cold
Mothing is clear, all your thoughts they have become so hard to find
With a question mark always slumped at the end of these awkward lines
All the simple words we loved to speak are no longer audible
And I never thought with you and I this would be possible
I can feel the world coming apart
And I need you by my side with your delicate heart
So please don't leave me no don't you run
Don't be frightened by the storm so bold and brave
Just let it rain"

Let me fall if I fall
Though the phoenix may or may not rise

I will dance so freely, holding on to no one
You can hold me only if you too will fall
Away from all these useless fears and shame

Someone I am is waiting for my courage
The one I want, the one I will become will catch me

let's go crazy,prince & the revolution,"Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today to get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life, it means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you, this is something else
The afterworld
A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe
'Cause in this life, things are much harder in the afterworld
In this life, you're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor (woo!)

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you, at least you got friends
You see, I called my old lady for a friendly word
She just picked up the phone, dropped it on the floor
""Ah, ah,"" is all I heard

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go

Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go

We're all excited, but we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause we're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what's it all for?)
You better live now before the Grim Reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go

Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go

C'mon baby, let's get nuts
Yeah, crazy

Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go
(Go crazy)
I said, ""let's go crazy"" (go crazy)
Let's go, go (let's go, let's go)
Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough, children
He's coming, he's coming, coming

Take me away"
let's go,cartel,"Let me reintroduce myself
As a man with a cause
I've had a lot of time to think
And forgot who we are
And I've got nothing left to say
But we've got to carry on
And I've got so much left to do
But I'll start with this song

Why do they lie?
Why can't you see?
Get up everybody
Stand up with me

Let's go! Everybody!
Let's go! Tell 'em we're coming
Let's go! Everybody!
Let's go! Stand up with me!
Let's go! Take the world with me

You've got something on your mind
But you get in your way
Don't tell us tomorrow
You better buy change today
All we have is who we are
And all we know is pretending
You gotta think of something real
Save the life worth spending

Why do they lie?
Why can't you see?
Get up everybody
Stand up with me

Let's go! Everybody!
Let's go! Tell 'em we're coming
Let's go! Everybody!
Let's go! Stand up with me!
Let's go! Take the world with me

So if you've got a torch to carry
Hold it high!
Take the world with me
Let it burn, let it burn, let it light up the sky!

Stand up! Get up, let's go
Stand up! You've gotta let them know
Stand up! You've gotta make them see
Get up people! Stand up with me!

Let's go! Everybody!
Let's go! Tell 'em we're coming!
Let's go! Everybody!
Let's go! So I'll sing...
Let's go! Everybody!
Let's go! Tell 'em we're coming!
Let's go! Everybody!

And plunge, little worm
Into the worm-hole with me

South to the sea
I got a sailboat for free
Yes, little worm, we'll sail the sewage out to sea

Don't be afraid

liberated,blueprint,"Gotta work every day
I thought I saw what Malcolm Little saw
Ah-ha, thought I saw it
I thought I saw what Malcolm Little saw

[Blueprint]
I thought I saw what Malcolm Little saw inside the game
That made him wanna draw an X across his last name
Dig inside himself and make a change
The turnin point from which things could never be the same
I'm talkin liberation - it seems no matter how far you make it
Somebody's out to sabotage what you hold sacred
It doesn't mean as much to them as it means to you
They only do it cause it's the cool thing to do
But they don't understand the things you do
They don't understand what it means to you to see your dreams come true
They wasn't up late night losin sleep wit'chu
They wasn't practicin the same routine all week as you
They didn't have to earn respect in the same scene as you
On tour wearin the same thing for a week or two
At first them chicks didn't want to speak to you
But now they tryin to get backstage to sneak a peek at you
I try to tell myself, don't let it define you
Don't let the limelight you're standin in blind you
Don't internalize it, don't let it get inside you
Appreciate the love you get but don't let it guide you
Don't let those other people make your life a mess
Way too many artists build their self-esteem around the press
Cause when the press loves you and the people don't respond
You feel like the fans owe you somethin and you're gettin robbed
My man Lo said it's best to do it for the people
Cause there's no hidden agends when they speak to you
But think about what MC's do
They say things to you, because they want things from you
Now right or wrong I gotta think about what I say
Cause people overanalyze my words because I got a name
Like my opinion means more because I got some fame
But in God's eyes we're all the same

[Chorus]
I'm liberated (""People in this country, are confused"")
I'm liberated (""They are fed lies, from the highest level"")

[Blueprint]
Yo, you know we had the baddest motherfuckin unit back in the days son
Inkwell, Plead the 5th and Logic
{?} Shabazz, Greenhouse, Soul Position
Who's Who, The Orphange, The Minor League, Greenhouse

And if you've ever heard me talk about it you can tell
Greenhouse Effect ain't the same without Inkwell
Me and Fest don't know if we should write more songs
Or leave well enough alone and let bygones be bygones
And that'll leave you brokenhearted
And have you feelin like you can't finish what you started
Sometimes I feel like I can't lead my team well enough
And say the right things to keep 'em all inspired, it's ill
I guess that's just how it is
I've seen women kill more careers than any whack album did
When she met you, she loved your songs
But later on she made you feel like what you do is wrong
Now she tellin you you're not givin your heart
Because you can't find a way to put her before your art
They used to be attracted to rock stars
Now all the sudden, she wants you to get a desk job
Even if you don't, she she treats you funny
Even though you're the one that's bringin in the money
Ha, but God don't like ugly
And you wouldn't act that way if you really loved me
I feel it in my heart and I know I'm not wrong
You don't love me, you just hate bein alone
Your life lacks meaning when I'm gone
You can't do anything on your own but I'm gone now and

[Chorus/Outro]
I'm liberated (""So do we say that it's time, to begin anew?"")
I'm liberated (""That it's time to stop goin along
with rhethoric and bullshit that you cannot endurse us"")
I'm liberated (""So we say, that we recognize that freedom is indivisible"")
I'm liberated (""A republic for people to have in them self respect"")
(""Because, that's all it's about, that's all human dignity is about"")
(""It's about individuals, it's about all of us"")
(""But it's also about, one's own self-respect"")"
lie detector,mýa,"New millennium

This is for all y'all out there
That ever dealt with somebody
Pump this in your Jeeps
Who be lying, fakin', cheatin', stealin', creepin', BS'in'
Pump this in your Jeeps
I got this thing called the lie detector
Two teaspoons and they're bound to tell the truth, listen
Pump this in your Jeeps
You told me that I was your fantasy, yeah (it's yours)
You said that we would practice monogamy
So, I became a freak under the sheets
Put his ass to sleep, creeped into the kitchen
Got the remedy, it's called the lie detector
I slipped it in his drink, brought it to his bedside
And said, ""Take a sip of this and don't think""
You won't believe what happened when he slipped the lie detector
Looked into his eyes, asked him, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""It's no surprise 'cause I've been with my ex girl""
""Why ain't you tell me the truth?""
He said, ""You don't wanna hear the truth""
Sometimes I wish I never gave him a detector
I thought he loved me but he loved her
So I'm kind of glad he took the lie detector
Now I know the truth, so you can get the boot

""I'll always be faithful so let's spend eternity""
So, he became a freak under the sheets (Uh huh)
Put her ass to sleep, creeped into the kitchen
Got the remedy, it's called the lie detector
Slipped it in her drink, brought it to her bedside
And said, ""Take a sip of this and don't think""
You won't believe what happened when he gave her lie detector
Looked at the pager number said, ""Who's code sixty-nine?""
She said, ""Don't be surprised 'cause 69's your best friend""
He looked and swallow his pride frontin' like tough guys don't cry
Sometimes he wish he never gave her a detector
Thought that she loved him, but she loved his best friend
But now he's kind of glad she took the lie detector
He found out the truth, so he gave her the boot (Beenie, man where you at?)

And suddenly everything is gone

I'll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I'll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can't catch me tonight
I'm not afraid, and I'm not alone
Even if I'm dancing on my own
I'll be lifted, lifted, lifted

All I hear is music, I'm losing all control
I have no excuses, can't say I wasn't told
If the sky turns black, I'll tell my heart relax
Late at night, in the dark, I close my eyes
And suddenly everything is gone

More than I, than I could have ever imagined
After all this waiting and this holding on
Suddenly everything was gone

light in your eyes,blessid union of souls,"I can't remember the last time that we kissed goodbye
All our I love you's were just not enough to survive
Something your eyes never told me
But it's only now too plain to see
Brilliant disguise when you hold me
And I'm free

I've been thinking and here's what I've come to conclude
Sometimes the distance is more than two people can use
But how could I have known girl
It was time and not space you would need
Darling tonight I could hold you and you would know
But would you believe

There's a light in your eyes that I used to see
There's a place in your heart where I used to be
Was I wrong to assume that you were waiting for me
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me

Cards and phone calls and photograph pictures of you
Constant reminder of all the things you get used to
Is there a chance in Hell or Heaven
That there's still something here to build on
Or do you just pick up the pieces after they fall
But after all

There's a light in your eyes that I used to see
And a song in the words that you spoke to me
Was I wrong to believe in your melody
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me

Should I keep on waiting or does love keep on fading away
Fading away

It's been a while since I've seen you so how have you been
Did you get my letter I wrote you that I did not send
I tried to call your old number
But the voice that I heard on the phone
I recognized but she told me the number was wrong

There's a light in my eyes it's too bright to see
And a pain in my heart where you used to be
Guess I was wrong to assume that you were waiting here for me
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me"

You had me right from the start
I had a feeling in my heart
When you walked through that door, girl

You really saved the day
I couldn't believe my eyes
You were the most beautiful girl
My mind was racing

Falling in love with you
I didn't know what to do
Laugh or cry
Do or die

I took a ride in my car
Traveling far just to see you
I knew nothing about it
Destiny's star guided me to you

I took a look at your face
I felt right in place
I was so in love with you, babe

You had me right from the start
I had a feeling in my heart
When you walked through that door, girl

You really saved the day
I couldn't believe my eyes
You were the most beautiful girl
My life was changed

Falling in love with you
I didn't know what to do
Laugh or cry, do or die

You were a mystery girl
Put my head in a whirl
You made a first class fool out of me

I couldn't believe your love
The shining stars above

And with every day
I was assured you'd be okay
You were so fantastic
Straight from the heart

You had me screaming for more
And I just loved you
The best that I could
Oh, yeah

And with every day
I was assured you'd be okay
You were so fantastic
Straight from the heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I took a ride in my car
Traveling far just to see you
I knew nothing about it
Destiny's star guided me to you

I took a ride in my car
Traveling far just to see you
I knew nothing about it
Destiny's star guided me to you

Life's alright
And in the middle of the night

I could see the light of day

Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me, the real me

Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up

Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do

Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down

And probably not the last
And I don't expect you to understand

Why I stayed upon this rock
After the birds had gone
And all of the waves turned to sand

I am a lighthouse
In a desert and i stand alone
I dream of an ocean that was here a long time ago
And I remember his cool waters and I still glow

These days the sunlight has bleached my paint
And the moonlight has made it plain
That nobody needs me to call them home

But i swear there was a time when
I would shine for him through the night
And he was the only ocean that I have known

I am a lighthouse
In a desert and I stand alone
I dream of an ocean that was here a long time ago
And I remember his cool waters and I still glow

Now my lantern bears a crack
And I know he will not be back
But I will leave the light on forever

I am a lighthouse

And I remember his cool waters and I still glow"

I owe mine to this state

For leavin' her this way
Tonight, I ride the lightning
To my final restin' place

Made me rob that store
An' as that boy lay there dyin'
I dropped my pistol on the floor

Yeah, I'd take it all back
But there's nothin' I can do
A-they've covered my face
An' the order's gone through
As the boss yells, ""Roll on two""

Now I'm flyin'
Up an' out of here
I close my eyes an' slowly rise

When the world moved too fast for us
It didn't flatter us to keep that company
But we were free on the dusty floorboards
All the people looking on

I'm not unaware
I'm in one place at one time
I'm neither here nor there

Tuned into the world
Plugged into my surroundings,
I'm not out on a limb.
I'm thinking in a straight line,
I'm thinking that these thoughts are mine,
My heart is beating oh so fast
I feel the hours crashing
Because my mind keeps time like clockwork,
And I think in sync like clockwork.

She's done away with emotion,
She sees things clearly now.
She says she sees it all from her room
And it looks so small from her room
It's all right, it's all right,
I'm on your side... for a while,
She thinks time is a concept by which we measure our pain
(She'll say it again)
She wants to say it again, but she don't have time,
And now her heart beats time like clockwork
And she thinks in sync like clockwork

Count the hours, count the months and minutes,
You're born in tears and die in pain and that's your limit
You're lookin' for a reason but there's none
There, why don't you admit it
We'll make the most of what we've got, that's the tickit
My, my, my.

I stayed in that room a long, long time
And watched the seasons gliding past
And hey... what's the matter?,
We've got time, lots of time
It's alright, it's alright,
I'm on your side for a while,
We'll wind up
We'll slow down
We'll speed up or slow down and we'll maybe overwind...
But now or minds, etc.

I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be

When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine
Is sweet and heady
Like my love
Lilac wine
I feel unsteady
Like my love

Listen to me
I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she
Coming to me
Nearly here

Lilac wine
Is sweet and heady
Where's my love
Lilac wine
I feel unsteady,
Where's my love

Listen to me
Why is everything so hazy
Isn't that she
Or am I just going crazy, dear?

And I'll never desert your bedside

And on the blankets that surround you

So rest your head
And I will be watching from the doorway
As you slip into a perfect, peaceful sleep

And morning will come
In all its simple glory
And you will find the light

And I will be there
Standing in your shadow
Knowing that you once were mine

A prayer if you will
Fell to the floor on blackened knees
And over trees fell still

Press my hands between my thighs
And pour fissile milk
Beg the thunderbolts to strike
And mark me as alive

All the lilies on the hill
All the lilies on the hill
All the lilies on the hill
Scented tonight

And so I finished up my prayer
Row slowly and I stared
But I was empty as a grave
And ghostless was the air

I'd like to bedden down my eyes
And search those frivolous skies
Again beg the thunderbolt to strike
To mark me or else I will die

All the lilies on the hill
All the lilies on the hill
All the lilies on the hill
Scented tonight

And in the seconds before I sleep
And in the seconds before I sleep
Did I believe what I did see?
Did I believe what came to me?

Appeared the figure of a man
Waving upon the hill
To the window I arrive
Insanity and sinned

Children of a private world
To be conceived in milk
Hundred marching to my door
All bringing drinks to drink

Thank God I'm alive
Thank God I'm alive

All the lilies on the hill
All the lilies on the hill
All the lilies on the hill
Scented tonight"
lily,pierre perret,"On la trouvait plutôt jolie, Lily
Elle arrivait des Somalies, Lily
Dans un bateau plein d'émigrés
Qui venaient tous de leur plein gré
Vider les poubelles à Paris

Elle croyait qu'on était égaux, Lily
Au pays d'Voltaire et d'Hugo, Lily
Mais, pour Debussy, en revanche
Il faut deux noires pour une blanche
Ça fait un sacré distinguo

Elle aimait tant la liberté, Lily
Elle rêvait de fraternité, Lily
Un hôtelier, rue Secrétan
Lui a précisé, en arrivant
Qu'on ne recevait que des Blancs

Elle a déchargé des cageots, Lily
Elle s'est tapée les sales boulots, Lily
Elle crie pour vendre des choux-fleurs
Dans la rue, ses frères de couleur
L'accompagnent au marteau-piqueur

Et quand on l'appelait Blanche-Neige, Lily
Elle se laissait plus prendre au piège, Lily
Elle trouvait ça très amusant
Même s'il fallait serrer les dents
Ils auraient été trop contents

Elle aima un beau blond frisé, Lily
Qui était tout prêt à l'épouser, Lily
Mais, la belle-famille lui dit
""Nous n'sommes pas racistes pour deux sous
Mais on veut pas de ça chez nous""

Elle a essayé l'Amérique, Lily
Ce grand pays démocratique, Lily
Elle aurait pas cru sans le voir
Que la couleur du désespoir
Là-bas, aussi ce fût le noir

Mais, dans un meeting à Memphis, Lily
Elle a vu Angela Davis, Lily
Qui lui dit ""viens, ma petite sœur""
""En s'unissant, on a moins peur""
""Des loups qui guettent le trappeur""

Et c'est pour conjurer sa peur, Lily
Qu'elle lève aussi un poing rageur, Lily
Au milieu de tous ces gugus
Qui foutent le feu aux autobus
Interdits aux gens de couleur

Mais, dans ton combat quotidien, Lily
Tu connaîtras un type bien, Lily
Et l'enfant qui naîtra, un jour
Aura la couleur de l'amour
Contre laquelle on ne peut rien

On la trouvait plutôt jolie, Lily
Elle arrivait des Somalies, Lily
Dans un bateau plein d'émigrés
Qui venaient tous de leur plein gré
Vider les poubelles à Paris"
linger,jonatha brooke,"I am walking past the sprinklers and the newly painted porches
And the lemonade stand girls on a suburban afternoon
I am leaving 'cause I love you, I am leaving 'cause I don't
And I am hoping you will follow, and I'm praying that you won't
Let me go

I am captive in your presence I will melt before your eyes
But I still crave your approval, and I'm helpless when you criticize, criticize

'Cause it's written on your body -- it's on the tip of your tongue
The look in your eyes, in the glare of the sun
The touch of your cold fingers, when you say goodbye
The way that you linger
The way that you lie

You saw me through the keyhole of a door that I kept locked
But I'd decorate the threshold just in case you knocked
What I might feel on the edges you will never come to know
And who I might be in the corners I will never ever ever ever show
Never show

'Cause it's written on my body -- it's on the tip of my tongue
The look in my eyes, in the glare of the sun
The touch of my cold fingers, when I say goodbye
The way that I linger
The way that I lie

Who said that love would linger who said that love would last
When we cannot seize the moment and we will not leave the past
I don't think I was afraid of you but how could I be sure
When with every altercation you were showing me the door
Well here I go, here I go, here I go...

'Cause it's written on our bodies -- it's on the tip of our tongues
The look in our eyes, in the glare of the sun
The touch of our cold fingers, when we say goodbye
The way that we linger
The way that we lie
The touch of your fingers
The look in your eyes
The way we accuse
The way we deny"
lions,jonquil,"And all the towns we built,
We built them so the lions could escape,
So they could roam in houses of their own.

The council wasn't there, just answer phone
The humans disappeared, they left their homes.
So the lions lived alone.

And all the towns we built,

Brilla en la oscuridad
Su sabor a la primera vez

Don, don, don
Don, don, don
A respirar

Siempre fue divertido correr
Dejar a este mundo detrás
Hoy la atmósfera comprime sus pies
Ella es mi chica lunar

Don, don, don

Mantarraya, enséñame más
Tu habilidad de nadar
Ella es mi espejo y refleja lo que soy
Y suele ser duro aprender

Don, don, don

Cuando me hundo en el mar (cuando me hundo en el mar)
De la fertilidad (de la fertilidad)

listen,beyoncé,"Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete

Listen, to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release

Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I'd thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I'm screaming out, and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't
If you won't
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But I will complete
Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own
My own"

When you put your kisses on me
I just melt into my shoes & everything I feel is due to you

Out of myself & into your arms
And you make me feel no other way will do,
Will do

Baby can't you see you will always be
My life
Baby can't you see you were meant to be

little house,the fray,"She doesn't look, she doesn't see
Opens up for nobody
Figures out, she figures out
Narrow line, she can't decide
Everything short of suicide
Never hurts, nearly works
Something scratching its way out
Something you want to forget about
A part of you that'll never show
You're the only one that'll ever know
Take it back when it all began
Take your time, would you understand
What it's all about?
Something scratching its way out
Something you want to forget about
No one expects you to get up
All on your own with no one around"
little kids,kings of convenience,"Little kids playing in the park downtown
Someone's dad is watching
From the side of the ground
I'm following my shadow so I cross the street
Car passing stereo I like the beat

Open up the door
Turning on the fan
Dropping down the keys that I held in my hand
And then start waiting for her steps
To be heard in the staircase
Enter the room and let down her bag
Asking me all kinds of trivial questions
Pretending an everyday life we don't have
Pretending an everyday life we don't have
Pretending an everyday life we don't have

Little kids playing in the park downtown
Soon they'll be all gone as the sun goes down
Little kids playing in the park downtown
Soon they'll be all gone as the sun goes down
And rises over, Brooklyn Bridge tomorrow
Hours later I will follow
Wake up to a life that's hollow without love
Without love...
Without love..."

To measure our hopes with our hearts
Hearts with our hands we've taught them language
Yeah, we've been waiting here where we've been for years

But i am alone till then

Eyes that shut me out
Embracing day after day, working it out

To distract from what
Will a hurricane sweep us? Into the dark blue cloud above
We are all wondering, wondering, wondering
And am I able to be a wife and a friend and a rebel
Why are we here in the first place
Settle down and live in a fable. Peter Pan lost at the pool table
Tiny little cars down there
Am I looking for trouble? Seeing stars in the Hubble?

We are all wondering, wondering, wondering
I'm forever so blind in this puzzle
What will be there to protect us
It's the little things, little things, little things"

loneliness,ed harcourt,"In an empty cinema
Loneliness
When your old friends drift apart
Loneliness
Wandering round the house in the dark
Loneliness
Faded glory you're a broken star
Loneliness

Loneliness, loneliness what would I do without you?

Stays around won't let you be
Loneliness
Corners me in dead-end streets
Loneliness
To bring unwanted memories
Loneliness
That find their way into my blood stream
Loneliness

Loneliness, loneliness what would I do without you?
Loneliness, loneliness is this all you have to give me?

Your love is a place for a lonely man
With too much in his head
The liars and thieves who cramp your style
Won't be there for your last breath
Be there for your las breath

Loneliness, loneliness what would I do without you?
Loneliness, loneliness is this all you have to give me?
To give me"

And I say I miss the way you breathe

I could be the one, I could make it up to you
Take me back, I'm the lonely boy who, who loves you

You say my broken heart becomes me
I say I'd sell it cheap to you
You say I should wrap all the lies I've told
In ten dollar bills and smoke
The money doesn't burn so clean

Do you see something you wanna see again?
I could be the one, I could make it up to you

loner,bruce cockburn,"Down at the bus station
Shark grins and sandpaper conversation
Men's faces women's bodies on the magazine stand
And a headline about Sarajevo and Tehran

They are radiant angels, they are earthly slaves
They are predators moving in their endless days
Days of striving, nights of novocaine
Never going to bring them freedom from their pain

I'm a loner
With a loner's point of view
I'm a loner
And now I'm in love with you

Wild shadows, acid verbs
Eyelids opening dans mon coeur
Tu me touche comme la pression
Des etoiles sur les tenebres*

In the elevator and the empty hall
How am I ever going to hear you when you call
I'm always living and I always die
On the event horizon of your eyes

I'm a loner
With a loner's point of view
I'm a loner
And now I'm in love with you

Eyelids opening in my heart
You touch me like the pressure

Away from here, away from me

When the wolves howl their song
And the whole earth is done
When the wolves howl their song

long black veil,diamanda galás,"Ten years ago on a cold dark night,
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall lights.
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed,
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me.

Chorus ~ She walks these hills, in a long black veil.
She visits my grave, when the night winds vail.
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows, but me

The Judge said son, what is your alibi,
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die.
I spoke not a word, though it ment my life,
For i'd been in the arms of my best friends wife.

Chorus

Now the schaffold is high, and eternity's near.
She stood in the crowd, and shed not a tear.
But some times at night, when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

Chorus ~ She walks these hills, in a long black veil.
When the cold winds blow, and the night winds wail.
No body knows, no body sees.
No body knows, but me."
long time,blondie,"I've been running circles 'round a night that never ends
I've been chasing heartache, in a city and a friend
I've been with you so long
Even seen you lose it, but who cares?

Racing down The Bowery, on a crowded afternoon
Tripping from The Davenport above your insecure typhoon
Can you even want me
Or is this just a way to keep you safe?

Take me, then lose me
Then tell them I'm yours
Are you happy?

Does it take you a long time?
Does it make you upset?
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend?
I can give you a heartbeat
I can give you a friend
I can make you think everybody wants to be your friend

Drinking with your cell phone with a smile on your face
Happy in success, but still a thousand miles away
Is this what you wanted
Is this everything you had in store?

Take me, then lose me
Then tell them I'm yours
Are you happy?

Does it take you a long time?
Does it make you upset?
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend?

You'll be seen between the shadows

Living your life like a saint
When it don't... no
It don't even matter
Even saints make their mistakes
Letting their dreams fall and break
All it feels like
Living in sunshine with the shades pulled down
Now I want you to see
How good life can be
You can turn around
And better your life
With the good times found

People will always take the long way around
Before you know it you'll be lost and found
Living in sunshine with the shades pulled down
People will always take the long way around
People will always take the long way around
Before you know it you'll be lost and found
Living in sunshine with the shades pulled down

When it's for the right side
Don't betray what I believe in
Stand where you want to stand
And I'll believe when I can
'Cause I'm telling you now
I been where you're living in

People will always take the long way around
Before you know it you'll be lost and found
Living in sunshine with the shades pulled down

Before you know it you'll be lost and found

Will tomorrow keep it's promise
No one here can say

And all we have is today

Stronger than any mountain cathedral
Truer than any tree ever grew
Deeper than any forest primeval
I am in love with you

I'll bring fire in the winters
You'll send showers in the springs
We'll fly through the falls and summers
With love on our wings

Through the years as the fire starts to mellow
Burning lines in the book of our lives
Though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow
I'll be in love with you
I'll be in love with you

Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens

And everythin' is gonna be alright, I swear

Look at your cat and your 80 square flat
Look at your view over Stockholm's Zoo
Maybe you're wrong but maybe I'm right
'Cause I guess I'm born black and white

You know you could be a rock and roll star
No matter who you are
It's all the same 'cause you're a real dead end

I've gotta kill another bottle of doom

Now everybody wanna dance with you
I cannot dance 'cause my boots are stuck with glue
Everybody wanna talk too much
But all I want is you

Look at your amount on your credit card account
A billion dollar tour but I just go far

As you cruise your Cadillac
My fear is that the tank that has just left
Will turn around and come back

See, I've known terror for quite some time
57 years so cruel
Terror breathes the air I breathe
It's the checkpoint on my way to school
Terror is the robbery of my land and the torture of my mother
The imprisonment of my innocent father
The bullet in my baby brother

The bulldozers and the tanks
The gasses and the guns
The bombs that fall outside my door
All due to your funds
You blame me for defending myself
Against the ways of my enemies
I'm terrorized in my own land, what?
And I'm the terrorist?

Yet do you know the truth of where your money goes?

Feed the forces that traumatize my every living day
So if I won't be here tomorrow, it's written in my fate
May the future bring a brighter day, the end of our wait?

Puzzled over lipstick traces
So help me God, I will not cry

I travel far and wander wide
No photograph of you beside me
Ol' Man River's not so shy
And he remembers Lorelei

River, river have mercy
Take me down to the sea
For if I perish on these rocks
My love no more I'll see

If I should float upon this stream
And see you in my madman's dream
I'd sink into your troubled eyes
And none would know 'cept Lorelei

Oh, river, river, river have mercy
Take me down to the sea
For if I perish on these rocks
My love no more I'll see

Should crash against these rocks my sorrows
I will drown before I die

losing you,sophie zelmani,"I can tell by your look
There's something missing, something I took
I can tell by the way you sound
Won't be long, you won't be around

I know it hurts, my kind of violence
Won't you tell how I hurt you?
Won't be long, you won't be around

loss,john frusciante,"We make the music that divides you
It's handed down as a thing to cry to
And all my wars they treat you kindly
There's nothing more important that i see
There was a time when all was empty
Unorganized a clog a death scene
Things opened up and there's so many
Paths to walk ports of entry
Now that I'm gone
Now that i'm long gone
This minute has come and gone
I never said to do anything but forget me
I can't be lost
I've learned everything form loss
For what's gained there's an inner cost
I won't pay it i never would
♪
We left the seasons back in Long Town
There was a hint of sadness going round
We met the brothers who drove arrows
And shot assumptions wide and narrow
I know i mean what i'm forgetting
We give for everything we're getting
A lot that hasn't been put away
It's building up for that fateful someday
Now that i'm gone
Now that i'm long gone
This minute has come and gone
I've never said to do anything but forget me
When it seems i'm around
Check again what's up and what's down
And the silences make a sound
Before the equation and i'm the answer

Leave you here wearing your wounds
Waving your guns at somebody new

lost highway,aaron,"Lost Highway, carry on
All the souls that I' ve known
I see flowers everywhere
But it's only cryings that comes up in the air
So many lives around I guess that it was just your time
For every roses, one big stone
One phone call, my world alone
I miss you, sweet mother
I'll see you some other time
Some other grounds
Lost Highway way too fast
Headlights burnin all my laughs
Where was I when you screamed
Where was I when you lost all your dreams
People think, that it's allright
When your face got so much lights
Did your blue eyes peacefully
Finally dived into the sea
I miss you sweet brother
I'll see you some other time
Some other grounds
Nothing could tell the power of your smell
How many hands on my head
You took the train with heavy tickets
It's not your fault
You couldn't make it
I know that the sun shines better
Now that you'll stay by his side
For ever
One phone call, my world alone
I miss you sweet sister
I'll see you some other time
Some other grounds"
lost in space,aimee mann,"Lost in space
A bubble drifting
Into a place
Where planets shift and
The moon's erased
Its features lift in the glare

But I'm the stuff
Of happy endings
Though mostly bluff
Belief suspending
But close enough
For just pretending to care

And I'm pretending to care
When I'm not even there
Gone, but I don't know where

Well, she's the face
And I'm the double
Who keeps the pace
And clears the rubble
And, lost in space
Fills up the bubble with air

By just pretending to care
Like I'm not even there
Gone, but I don't know where

You split like a cell
And then cannot tell
The line from its parallel

So baby, beware
I'm just pretending to care
Like I'm not even there
Gone, but I don't know where
Gone, but I don't know where
Gone, but I don't know where"

Watch the time
Leaves you standing poring over moments in life

I know I lost my soul

So I wait to sieze the day
The clouded mind
The hell I've a lot to pay
I find that if you know
Your way you get out of this mess

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul

I know there comes a time
To believe in yourself
And grow in confidence
Stop hiding behind the door
Like everyone else
Just get out and do your best

I know I'll put up a fierce fight

lounge,regina spektor,"I don't care that flowers grow for you and me, and me
You don't know what love is 'til you see her standing there
A web of skin and nails and hair
A web of skin and nails and hair, and bones and bones
And thoughts rushing in and out your head
You think you are alive, but you are dead
You keep on driving in your car asleep
On driving in your car

I don't know why flowers grow in wintertime
The sky turns gray, the sun don't shine
And people rush to be on time
For warmth, they wrap themselves in woolen cloaks
And hats, and scarves
Like larvae in their incubating cars
Like larvae in their cars
And drive
And drive

And drive
And drive, and drive
And drive, and drive
Until they get away"

A red light turns green - not even aware

But just one look and it's love at first sight
It was love -- love at first sight
Love - Love at first sight
Love - Love at first sight
Love - Love at first sight
Well I found love -- but love ain't enough
So gimme that gimme that all that stuff
I'm free and easy
I got 1, 2, 3,
Getting is good
Now 5, 6, 7, 8 - I would if I could
My dick was very hard and she dropped down to her knees
If that's the way she cooks such a hypermaniac
It was love - love at first sight
Love - Love at first sight

It was love - Love at first sight
I said love - Love at first sight
No it was love can't ya' see

When you're closer to losing your dreams
Than losing a friend
Flying blind

And if it takes me a lifetime
I swear I'll tear down every wall
Love conquers all
On my way
Tomorrow I rise with the sun
Soon I'll be gone
Words can't say
How the memories of feelings of love
They linger on
Oh girl
And if it takes me forever
I know it's worth every teardrop that falls
Love conquers all
Somewhere there's a place in your heart
Where the wounds never heal
Well you're not alone
That's just how I feel
Love conquers all
This one will last a lifetime
And if love conquers all
This one will last forever"

love no,the teenagers,"You're always like ""why do you have to see your friends so often, are they more important than me?
You spend so much time on your computer, but you shouldn't, cause your eyes are getting red. Or maybe it's the... whatever.
Are you really going to eat that pizza? It looks 'so' greasy!
And your bathroom, it's worse than disgusting""

You party too much, no wonder you're always tired.
What about that movie 'Showgirls'
I can't believe you're watching it again, you've already seen it like 15 times.
Please come for dinner with me and my friends, it will be great 'cause we're 'so' funny
And for god's sake, stop smoking all the time!""

love of my life,queen,"Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, and now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

You will remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side to remind you
How I still love you (I still love you)

Back, hurry back
Please, bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life

love someone,dub_fx,"It’s possible to love someone
And not treat them in the way that you want
It’s possible to see your eyes
Be the devil in disguise with another front
And, it’s possible to change this world
Revolutionize the boys and girls
It’s possible to educate
The next generation that will rule the world someday
The changing times of the 21st century
Means nothing to me cos I would rather be
At the beginning of time, earth would be mine
Living in luxury
Discovering a world out there
Believing in the sun earth water and air
Take me there so I could see the world bloom
Standing on a sea cliff howling at the moon
Creating a world for the open minded
A unique perception of truth inside it
I know we could find it
It’s just a matter of where and when we collectively decide it
The world is not a vicious place
It’s just the way we’ve been raised
Discovering time and space
I know that we could make a change
Rearrange the way that we appreciate the world today
It’s possible to love someone..
Now as i start to put my mind into words
I stall I fall I’m loosing it all, my inhibitions
The thought of wasting a way
The fact that the music’s at a place not far away
Yet I stray and stick to my world
In love with my life my beliefs and a girl
Is it luck that I love this crazy place, the human race?
Don’t get me wrong I still think we could change
But this life and the fact that time exists
And were here and we don’t come equipped with it all
Half the fun is learning and I’m having a ball
While the world keeps turning my role is small
But I’ll make a change
I hope you’re feeling the same way
I hope you’re seeing what I say
It’s possible to love someone..
In this concrete jungle we live
Our survival is love that we give
Now my instinct is guiding my way
It’s true what they say
The world is your chance to create"
love song,311,"Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you"

love will tear us apart,nouvelle vague,"When routine bites hard
And ambitions are low
And resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways
Taking different roads
Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Why is the bedroom so cold
Turned away on your side?
Is my timing that flawed
Every feeling run so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives
And love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Do you cry out in your sleep
All my failings expose?
Gets a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Why is it something so good
Just can't function no more?
And love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again"
love you madly,ella fitzgerald,"Love you madly,
Right or wrong,
Sounds like the lyric of a song.
But since it's so,
I thought you ought to know,
I love you,
Love you madly.

'Better fish are in the sea'

And that's for sure,
Just like I said before,
I love you,
Love you madly.

If you could see the happy you and me
I dream about so proudly.
You'd know the breath of spring that makes me sing
My love song so loudly.

Good things come to those who wait,
So just relax and wait for fate.
To let me see the day you say with me,
'I love you,
Love you madly.'

And that's for sure,
Just like I said before,
I love you,
Love you madly.
If you could see the happy you and me
I dream about so proudly.
You'd know the breath of spring
That makes me sing

No I will never let you go
Make me wanna fly to the top of every rainbow

loveless love,louis armstrong,"Love is like a hydrant: it turns off and on
Like some friendships when your money's gone
Love stands in with the loan sharks when your heart's in pawn

If I had some strong wings like an aeroplane
Had some broad wings like some aeroplane
I would fly away forever
Never to come again

For love, oh, love, oh, loveless love
Has set our hearts from gold-less gold
From milk-less milk and silk-less silk
We are growing used to soul-less souls

Such grafting times we never saw
That's why we have a pure full law
In everything we find a flaw
Even love, oh, love, oh, loveless love
Just to fly away from loveless love"
lovelife,lush,"You are the one, in your concrete arms I adore you
Dirty and dear, block out the sun
In your twists and turns I invade
You show me no fear

We blow around like tiny leaves in a big storm
Finding there's nothing left to breathe or to keep warm
You ebb and flow and your rhythm beats my head
Leave me alone while you swallow up the dead

You are the one, you cradle me and kill, caressing my face
Leave me undone, you suffocate and have me, this is the place
Every door conceals a dream and a nightmare
Nothing is ever really pure in the stale air

And when it's dark everything becomes more clear
Lie in the park when I want to have you near

You are the one, in your concrete arms I adore you
Dusty and dear, block out the sun
In your twists and turns I invade
You show me no fear

Left it unsung, I shall leave but I'll return
Poison my lungs, my blood is full of lead
Things unsaid, my love for you still burns"

I want to know all of you, what makes you smile what makes you blue.

Making a new path and a brand new day

Someday when I'm in love

You lookin' like a cover of a magazine
Why am I slave under the female sex
I don't wanna waste my time again

Someday I'm in love
When I've been drinkin' a lot of wine
I'm in love
Feels like heaven can wait for me

It can wait for me
And you know why

And I've tried everything to cure my soul
Going down in hell with a bottle of you
Nothing can change the way I feel for her
The devil in the glass is telling me what to do

Someday I'm in love
When I've been drinkin' a lot of wine
I'm in love
Feels like heaven can wait for me

It can wait

Sticks and stones can't break my bones
But you can always hurt me inside

Come on and love me inside

And someone put a coin in a wishing well
Why am I slave under the female sex
I don't wanna waste my time again

Maybe someday when I'm in love

But night time brings the creature from the can

But there's always safety from the crowd

loyalty,blue scholars,"Patience, understanding, loyalty, loyalty
Bayani, loyalty (got to have)

It's more than just a hobby or pastime
'Cause 24/7 I'm representin' the Massline
Daily grind, 85, wonder why, maybe I'm
Way behind lately been occupyin' my mind
With the possibility this means we'll all end
With two albums and a handful of people I call friends
And friends I call my comrades, and comrades who stand
Together write a book 'till it ends
Indeed as we be headed in directions getting whole towns polarized
Either love it or leave it, indeed I'm giving credit to the fam who believed it
Preceding the hype of the hyperbole of the media
Even though some people abandon ship on the other hand
Some were skeptical quick, but now they quick to bandwagon up
Saggin' my pants at the cocktail party with the mayor
And later rockin' a party with a thousand in the air
That's a beautiful thing, and if you're new to this thing
Don't front, ask a question, stay humble, do your thing
But just remember you ain't gotta prove a thing
Stand up or fall down thanks for listenin' y'all

Because I, got your back even if you don't got mine
Grind in the dark when the clock strikes hard times
We ain't nothing if this bond ain't solidified
Give thanks in war time that people still alive

Dignified soldiers who walk with the spirit of 12 million plus lost and found in this lyric
Sound man turn it till the whole town hear it
Either stand up or fall down now if you feel it
Stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
While the record goes round stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
While the record goes round let the whole town know that it's us

Somebody tell me where the riders and the soldiers are
Before they close the door and go and start a colder war
I see 'em posted up in corner stores holdin' fort
Hopin' for a life from the crack of an open door
And so the storm comes to cleanse without warn
While the youth play with fire just to keep themselves warm
In a cold world, cold people, playin' cold songs
Sold for spare change while the broke hold on
Why they call themselves right, but then act so wrong
Dollar sign challenge why the unemployment line long
No call for the blue collar gettin' low ball
It's a long climb just to get to petty bourgeois
While we, gettin' lifted but forgettin' that we fall
Hit and shake cause your movin' but without the roll call
This is protracted struggle revolutionized patience
Bump this on your right wing radio station
And maybe crack a top 10 daily rotation but until then
You can keep ignorin' what I'm sayin'
But just remember you ain't gotta prove a thing
Stand up or fall down thanks for listenin' y'all

Because I, got your back even if you don't got mine
Grind in the dark when the clock strikes hard times
We ain't nothing if this bond ain't solidified
Give thanks in war time that people still alive

Dignified soldiers who walk with the spirit of 12 million plus lost and found in this lyric
Sound man turn it till the whole town hear it
Either stand up or fall down now if you feel it
Stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
While the record goes round stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
While the record goes round let the whole town know that it's us"
lua,bright eyes,"I know that it is freezing
But I think we have to walk
I keep waving at the taxis
They keep turning their lights off
But Julie knows a party at some actor's west side loft
Supplies are endless in the evening
By the morning they'll be gone

When everything is lonely
I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and a paper
Have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons
And my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening
By the morning looks like shit

And I know you have a heavy heart
I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me
Have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
But me I'm not a gamble
You can count on me to split
The love I sell you in the evening
By the morning won't exist

You're looking skinny like a model
With your eyes all painted black
Just keep going to the bathroom
Always say you'll be right back
Well, it takes one to know one, kid
I think you got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening
By the morning's such a drag

I got a flask inside my pocket
We can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious
I will try and do the same
Well, we might die from medication
But we sure killed all the pain
What was normal in the evening
By the morning seems insane

And I'm not sure what the trouble was
That started all of this
The reasons all have run away
But the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend
But it is one way to live
'Cause what is simple in the moonlight
By the morning never is

It was so simple in the moonlight
Now it's so complicated
It was so simple in the moonlight
So simple in the moonlight
So simple in the moonlight"
lucky charms,the moldy peaches,"You're a star, steal my car, just save me
On a roll, sell my soul, forgiveness
Crossed with red, think I'm dead, its over
Words you say leave my head or hold me

Holy ground, cup of dirt. down pavement
Smell your shirt and I hurt 'till tomorrow
I feel like I'm chasing
The guy from Lucky Charms

Fell in love out of love, still dreaming
Flying blue without you, slow motion
Baseball champs, gothic vamps and stage fright
I love hard as a guard, I'm crying

Now you're gone, I'm a wave without direction
Baby born lost its way in the forest
I feel like I'm chasing
The guy from Lucky Charms

Now I'm gone
Now I'm gone
Now I'm gone
Now I'm gone
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone

Now I feel like I'm chasing
The guy from Lucky Charms

All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
Leaving home
Leaving home
Leaving home
Leaving home

All alone
All alone"
lucky day,chris rea,"A little bit of daylight shine on your pillow
Come through your window pane
Speak of the morning, hope is eternal
Better to look at it this way
This could be my lucky day

A glass filled with crystals, six million rainbows
Gifted to see with children's eyes
Always a small chance shooting that rainbow
Bless this dawn with sweet surprise
This could be my lucky day

No inhibitions, naive forever
Better looking up than looking down
Don't try to beat it, twist and defeat it
Leave those kind of complications never to be found
This could be my lucky day"
lucky you,the national,"Every time you get a drink
And every time you go to sleep
Are those dreams inside you head?
Is there sunlight on your bed?

And every time you're driving home
Way outside your safety zone
Wherever you will ever be
You're never getting rid of me

You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me

You coulda made a safer bet
But what you break is what you get
You wake up in the bed you make
I think you made a big mistake

You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me
You own me
Lucky you

You own me
There's nothing you can do

You clean yourself to meet
The man who isn't me
You're putting on a shirt
A shirt I'll never see
The letter's in your coat
But no one's in your head
'Cause you're too smart to remember
You're too smart

Lucky you
Lucky you
Lucky you"
lucky,donna summer,"Scared and lonely
Goin' out for the night
Shakin' all over
And wishing I'd never come here

He pulled up in a cloud of smoke
So much was said
But nobody spoke a word

So I took a chance
And he followed me home
I knew he wouldn't beg
So I gave in without fighting

It's been so long since I loved this way
So I asked him if he would stay for a while

Lucky comes easy
Lucky's not shy
And if you're lucky
You'll go for a ride
For a ride

We talked for a while
And he told me his life
We laughed and we cried
And I knew that I could love him

He got up to say goodbye
I said, ""Where you going?""
He said that he must leave

Lucky comes easy
Lucky's not shy
And if you're lucky
You'll go for a ride
For a ride

Lucky comes easy
Lucky's not shy
And if you're lucky
You'll go for a ride
For a ride

Lucky takes you out for a ride
For a ride
Lucky takes you out for a ride

Lucky comes easy
Lucky's not shy
And if you're lucky
You'll go for a ride

Lucky come easy
Lucky's not shy
And if you're lucky
You'll go for a ride"
lucy,hanson,"The day that I left Lucy
A tear fell from her eye
Now I don't have nobody, and I was such a fool
On the day that I left Lucy.
The day that I left Lucy she cried, then said goodbye
Now it's done, and it's over, and I am all alone
On the day that I left Lucy
Now I don't have anymore songs to sing
'Cause you were everything, everything to me
I didn't realize I felt this way, until that day
Today I'm missing Lucy, and you say that she's OK, I hope she is.
Now I don't have nobody and no one will ever replace...
My Lucy
I love Lucy, Lucy...
On the day that I left Lucy... my Lucy"
lullabye,ben folds five,"Goodnight, goodnight sweet baby
The world has more for you
Than it seems
Goodnight, goodnight
Let the moonlight take the lid off your dreams

We took a small flight
In the middle of the night
From one tiny place to another
And my parents they remained
At the shack with Lorraine
And my aunt and my Grandpa and brother
We walked past the tarmac
And boarded the craft
The rain had me chilled to the bones
Just the three of us took flight that night
Uncle Richard, me and James Earl Jones

And the pilot he gave me a blanket
And the tall dark man sang to me in deep
Rich tones...

Goodnight, goodnight sweet baby
The world has more for you
Than it seems
Goodnight, goodnight
Let the moonlight take the lid off your dreams"
lush life,john coltrane & johnny hartman,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis
Of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there
You could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along
With your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while
That your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life
In some small dive

And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely, too

Romance is mush

lust,the raveonettes,"I fell out of heaven
To be with you in hell
My sin's not quite seven
Nothing much to tell

Lust I haven't craved
A saintly boy I'm not
I'll take it to my grave
A side cursed on rot

I ride these roads alone
Beneath the sulfur sky
Everywhere I roam
Life is one big lie

When the fireball goes down
Out by L.A. ways
I come into town
But only for a day

Starving in bad means
I pray for you to understand
A man sure is weak
But lust holds my hand

I struggled and I cried
I pounced with no avail
At least I never lied
Or did the truth derail"

All of your time just to hate me
Every dime gone to ways
You can find that might bait me
And drag me down

In your fortress you feel like

Never mind how you've rationed your time
And the battle is underway
Maybe times are gonna change

With words you don't mean

There doesn't seem to be any other way

I'm not savouring life
I've forgotten how good it could be
To feel alive

Crazy as it sounds you won't
Feel as low as you feel right now
At least that's what I've been told by everyone

I whisper empty sounds in your ear
And hope that you won't let go

Take the pieces and build them skywards

Cause I've started falling apart
I'm not savouring life
I've forgotten how good it could be
To feel alive

mad pursuit,junkie xl feat. electrocute,"Run don't break
Aiming for the heart
Doll headache
This is just the start
Of a mad pursuit

Chasing down the telephone wire
Racing down the road
You can't lose her

Try to skip town
(She'll find you)
Track you like a hound
(Behind you)
Recklessly
In pursuit of you

Catch you on the fly
(You're easy)
She knows you're her guy
(So safely)
Recklessly
In pursuit of you

Closing in
See her in the mirror
Here it goes again
The object's closer than it appears to be

But a crash
Of your getaway car
Drive like that
And you won't get too far

Try to skip town
(She'll find you)
Track you like a hound
(Behind you)
Recklessly
In pursuit of you

Catch you on the fly
(You're easy)
She knows you're her guy
(So safely)
Recklessly
In pursuit of you

Crash
And burn
This will be your thing
Hold you tight
You just lost control
Of a mad pursuit

Chasing down the telephone wire
Racing down the road
You can't lose her

Try to skip town

Track you like a hound
(Behind you)
Recklessly
In pursuit of you

Catch you on the fly

I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain
'Till I am made of stone

Take your time
I'm not scared
Make me everything you need me to be
So the judgment seems fair
Don't waste your time

It's never enough for you, baby
Don't want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
Now that I have tried everything

madrigal,opeth,"Our abode 'mongst the stars is waiting,
Long enough for our last breath of life.
You stare at nothing, right through me,
At times resembling the Devil's concubine.
And me, I am the idol that would long
To caress our eyes until they would open no more.
I would comfort you if I only could,
But as we all know by now... I am just thin air.
Unaware as you are of my presence,
You are losing yourself.
Hiding within the Amen Corner"
mafia,kelis,"Ah! ah! ah! ah!

Somebody made me an offer and I accepted
Forever in debted to weapon
Love, honor, and respected
But his image was different than what his character reflected
Word is he's seven-thirty his hands never dirty

All I know this so called psycho never hurt me
Took me down to Tif's, shopping sprees on fifth
With enough dough that could be carry out on forklifts
Earnt his trust, together till we turn to dust
Until his theory disintegrated and burnt to crust
What? (What?)

Death do us apart
That's what I vow to you
The vows I vow to you
Amazing how it's true

Talk goes on our phone
Just to remind you
That I'm behind you
The feds won't find you

Relax my love the love I have for you is like a Mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you of course
Since my love is like a Mafia
And for you I will fight

Mister and misses, but I wonder where the bliss is
Sealed in blood and Cordion kisses
The shit I witnessed
Would give a bitch morning sickness

Decomposed bodies thrown in the ditches
As for snitches ain't nothing lower than that
Intentions to squeal on your fam make you low as a rat
Got cappos for flaming at those
Lame ass hoes, so you know next time keep your trap close

What would you doubt for?
I'd never lie to you
Of course I'd die for you
I'd be your eye for you

My love rest assured
I'll raise our sons for you
I'll save our ones for you
Load up your guns for you

Relax my love the love I have for you is like a Mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you of course
Since my love is like a Mafia
And for you I will fight

Relax my love the love I have for you is like a Mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you of course
Since my love is like a Mafia
And for you I will fight

Rich in tradition n- once held dear
Let it be known that your name alone spell fear
Gun for gun, hundred to one forget about it
Petty shit, rise above and get up out it
Could give a shit about it

Time to focus a foe
Many lives bought and sold
Fortunes favor the bold
Connected like phone lines
To racketeering to known crimes
Winners turning long shots to gold mines

The high speed chases
I'll do them just like you
I'll give them dust like you
Turn around and bust like you
Then I'll disappear
And return like Jedi

Relax my love the love I have for you is like a Mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you of course
Since my love is like a Mafia
And for you I will fight

For you I testify, oh, oh
And for you I will fight"

I want to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl

No, you don't know me well
In every little thing only time will tell
But you believe the things that I do
And we'll see it through

Life can be short or long
Love can be right or wrong
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through
I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl

Baby, you know that dreams, they're for those who sleep
Life, it's for us to keep
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through
I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl"

make you feel my love,ronan keating,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There is nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change are throwing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love"
make you mine,donavon frankenreiter,"From the bottom of the sea

Said i'll make you mine, mine, mine
I'm gonna make you mine, mine, mine
I'm gonna make you mine, mine, mine

Said you never had a home
I gave you my heart and let you roam
Havent had time to unpack your case
Its alright let the sun shine on your face

But you got, show me a sign
Said you got, show me a sign

making love,roberta flack,"Here,
Close to our feeling,
We touch again,
We love again

Remember when we thought
Our hearts would never mend?
And we're all the better for each other

There's more to love,
I know,
Than making love

Here
No more confusion
We see our lives,
We live our lives

Remember when we thought
We never would survive?
But now neither one of us is breaking

There's more to love,
I know,
Than making love

Some things never change
Some things sometimes do
And now I'm feeling strong enough
To let you in

And now neither one of us is breaking
Knowing now that there's more to love
Than making love

And I remember you
And making love
And I remember you

And I remember you
Oooo
And I remember you
And I remember you
Oooo"

You and me, mathematically, add up or so I'm told

Instinctively, hypnotically, we always keep in time

Oh I know the air tonight is the same as it was before
I can't account for feeling this
You make me beg for more

Making music
Making music
Making music by numbers

Words can be my enemy but rhythms on my side
Circulating round you while my eyes are on the prize
I couldn't plan the things I do, or calculate my move
When you and me amount to this my number skills improve

Leave aside anxiety and just enjoy the ride
I can't be sure of where we'll go
The beat can be our guide

Making music

Sweet music by numbers

Making music
Watch me use it
See me lose it
By numbers"

Rancid marble cheese or a steak that's second rate
Awful TV programs or a broken Elvis plate
Or his fiancé who dumps him because he's gaining weight

There's no truth
In that lovely, wooden home
You spent your youth.
I promise
That I won't leave
Before you dress my arms
Back up in sleeves,
Mama, oh Mama.
Where's the trust in running?
Baby cool your head, I'm coming.

I've hunted
Down my past,
Held it close to the earth.
I made it last.
But now
Solace still keeps my head,
Just knowing all that's said, and done
Is simply dead,
Father, oh Father.
My thoughts they all come drumming.
Telling me to just keep humming,
Mama, oh Mama.
Where's the trust in running?
Baby cool your head, I'm coming"

My daddy went away too soon
Now he's living on the moon

Hang on to me people, we're going down
Down among the fishes in an absence of sound
It's the presence of distance and it's floating in time
It's lack and it's longing and it's not very kind

Send it scratching in this rented room
Scratching and a tapping to the man in the moon
'Bout all the things that I've been taught
My daddy was an astronaut"

A state where I was born and raised

For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasure here on earth I found
For in this world I'm bound to travel
I have no friends to help me now

You may bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I'm sleeping in my grave

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face, you'll never see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore"

And a pot head

Because you're sweet
And you give me lots of lovin'
And you eat meat
And that's how you became
My only man of the hour

You never lie
And you don't cheat
And you don't have any baggage tied
To your four feet
Do I deserve
To be the one
Who will feed you breakfast, lunch, and dinner
And take you to the park at dawn
Will you really be
My only man of the hour

I know you'll never bring me flowers
But flowers, they will only die
And though we'll never take a shower together
I know you'll never make me cry

You never argue
You don't even talk
And I like the way you let me lead you
When we go outside and walk
Will you really be
My only man of the hour
My only man of the hour
My only man of the hour

To rock you 'til the grave
His power drill shocks

For those who dare because it's there
I know I've seen
Now and then I've suffered imperfection
I've studied marble flaws
And faces drawn pale and worn
By many tears
I am that I am from out of nowhere
To fight without a cause
Roots strain against the grain
With brute force you'd better
Hold out when you're in doubt
Question what you see
And when you find an answer
Bring it home to me."

marrow,ani difranco,"The answer came
Like a shot in the back
While you were running from your lesson
Which might explain
Why years later all you could remember
Was the terror of the question
Plus, you weren't listening
You were stockpiling canned goods
Making a bomb shelter of our basement
And i can't believe you let the moral go by
While you were soaking in the product placement

Where was your conscience?
Where was your consciousness?
And where did you put all those letters
That you wrote to yourself
But could not address?

I'm a good kisser
And you're a fast learner
And that kinda thing could float us
For a pretty long time
Then one day you'd realize
You've memorized my phone number
And you'll call it and find it's a disconnected line
Cuz i got tossed out the window of love's el camino
And i shattered into a shower of sparks on the curb
You were smoking me
Weren't you?
Between your yellow fingers
You just inhaled and exhaled without saying a word

Where was your conscience?
Where was your consciousness?
And where did you put all those letters
That you wrote to yourself
But could not address?

There's a smorgasbord of unspoken poisons
A whole childhood of potions
That are all bottled up
And so one by one i am dusting off labels
I am uncorking bottles and filling up cups
So go ahead and have a taste of your own medicine
And i'll have a taste of mine
But first let's toast to the lists
That we hold in our fists
Of the things that we promise to do
Differently next time

Cuz the answer came like a shot in the back
While you were running from your lesson

Why years later all you could remember
Was the terror of the question
Plus i'm not listening to you anymore
My head is too sore and my heart's perforated
And i'm mired in the marrow of my (well... ain't that) funny bone
Learning how to be alone and devastated
Where was my conscience?
Where was my consciousness?
And what do i do with all these letters
That i wrote to myself
But cannot address?"

After everything I've done

Got turned around somehow
Who is my savior now

Just to feel the wind
I shook off my innocence
Now I want it back again

Ninety miles from nowhere
I was going nowhere fast

mary,noah and the whale,"Oh the cold wet wind blew over the heather
You wrote Charlie and Mary for forever
On the back of a rock
That you picked up on the way
And in that perfect moment
I nearly ruined it
By saying I love you
And nearly meaning it
But you know I would never waste those words
Oh when I last saw Mary
She lied and said it was her birthday
Oh when i last saw mary
She lied and said it was her birthday

But then she
Tried to kiss me
And I said don't bother
You know we don't really love one another
And there's no use
In burning out this flame
Oh but then things changed in a way I couldn't predict
She said I love you and it suddenly clicked
That she was only saying what she wanted me to hear
And I said
Please don't lie to me Mary
And I said
Please don't lie to me Mary

I said
Please don't lie
Oh it makes me cry in bed
I said
Please don't lie
Oh it makes me cry in bed
I said
Please don't lie
Oh it makes me cry in bed
And she said
Shut your mouth
You don't know what you're talking about
Oh she said
Shut your mouth
You don't know what you're talking about"

Because your eyes are always on your feet

Don't be stupid, girl

Somebody's mixed up statements

Never listening, you just kick back
How do you handle all the bullshit
That gets thrown your way?

master plan,thestart,"Empty bottle in these hands again tonight
You could never get it right
I am shattered to the core
From the Saturday before
Now to big for there is nothing left to say
Except I wish we never met
Big eyes big enough to see
You were not the one who's meant for me

I had a master plan for you
But you let me down
I am over it now
I am over it now
I had a master plan for you
But you let me down
I am over it now
I am over it now

Diagrams and calculations had been made
This should last a long, long while
Just a few things left to chance
Nothing of significance
Nothing I hate more than weakness
Being feigned
By the girl who holds the reins
Nothing I hate more than that
But the man who foiled my master plan

I had a master plan for you
But you let me down
I am over it now
I am over it now
I had a master plan for you
But you let me down
I am over it now
I am over it now

You will never get it right

I'm not shattered like I was before

You're always the last one to leave
Those dimly lit rooms.
Making sure the last glass makes its way to the table empty.
And every bottle in the place
Has been upside down
At least a few times what a waste.
Is this what's left of you these days?
You're not eighteen anymore.
Five years should have been,
Enough time for you to grow up and get over this.
Not too cool to be throwing up all morning sick
From what you might have done or done it with.
And I swear if I could take your pain
And frame it and hang it on my wall,
Maybe you would never have to hurt it all.
Painting pictures in red and blue.
A portrait bruise just like you
And now you're walking away.
You're not eighteen anymore.
Five years should have been,
Enough time for you to grow up and get over this.
Not too cool to be throwing up all morning sick from what you might of done.
When is enough, finally enough?
The hang-ups and the heartbreaks get you past.
Our failures lay down but just accept yourself.
Find some thing that brings you closer to complete.

masters of war,josé feliciano,"Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build the big bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand o'er your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead"
matador,arctic monkeys,"She was marrying a matador and he was with the weather girl
A very clever girl who stood out amongst several once
A terrible dilemma and forever he'll regret this day

There's blood on your chin where you've bitten your tongue
Smitten, but might not be smitten for long
If you're still sitting, she'll soon be smitten and gone"

With my head to the sky I forget to keep my feet
On the ground, need to come back down

I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice

And so I'm living for a dream
Each lonely day spent looking for the sunshine
I'll make believe that I don't care
I'll tell my friends I love my life, I'm happy

Maybe tomorrow I will love again
I'll never know until I looked into her eyes
Maybe tomorrow I will love again
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice

Wherever, whoever you may be
Let the light of your love
Shine through the window of my heart
And when you've colored all my thoughts bright
Don't let me ever, ever think of night, no

No, yeah
Maybe tomorrow you will love again
I'll never know until I looked into her eyes
Maybe tomorrow you will love again
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice

medusa,an pierlé,"Strange, in troubled water
I am drowning in a goofy way
Strange, how my perception
Is slightly coloured by a blue haze
Strange, how I even got here
I was dying to be still alive
Fishes nibble at my body
As I'm a free meal floating by

If you dive on your own
You'll get lost in the sea
Lost your sense of direction?
Just follow me
I'll be near
If you dive, dive, dive

Strange, how under water
Sound is waves upon the air
Strange, I hear myself breathing
I am rising as I lose air
Strange, it now feels stupid
I was crying as we disagreed
Built on incense and mirrors
Broken pieces on the bottom is the last thing we need

If you dive on your own
You'll get lost in the sea
Lost your sense of direction?
Just follow me
I'll be near
If you dive, dive, dive"
megalomania,black sabbath,"I hide myself inside the shadows of shame.
The silent symphonies were playing their game.

Why don't you just get out of my life now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone yeah?

Obsessed with fantasy, possessed with my schemes,
I mixed reality with pseudo-God dreams.
The ghost of violence was something I've seen.
I sold my soul to be the human obscene.

How could this poison be the dream of my soul?

It's like a trip inside a separate mind.
The ghost of tomorrow from my favorite dream
Is telling me to leave it all behind.

Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow.
Got to get to happiness, want no more of sorrow.
How I lied, went to hide,
How I tried to get away from you, now.
Am I right, if I fight?
That I might just get away from you, now.
Sting me!

Well I feel something's giving me the chance to resign;
It's giving me the chance of saving my soul.
Beating the demigod, I'm fading away,
I'm going backwards but I'm in control.

Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow.
Getting back to sanity, from the depths of sorrow.
Was it wise, to disguise,
How I tried to get away from you now?
Is there a way, that I could pay,
Or is it true I have to stay with you now?

How I lied, went to hide,
How I tried to get away from you, now,
Am I right, if I fight?
That I might just get away from you, now.
Suck me!

I'm really digging Schizophrenia, the best of the earth,
I've seized my soul in the fires of Hell.
Peace of mind eluded me, but now it's all mine.
I simply try, but he wants me to fail.

Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow.
Now I've found my happiness, providence of sorrow.
No more lies, I got wise.
I despise the way I worshipped you, yeah.

And now instead I won't be led by you, now.

And then they cry for all to see

Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge

Try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee"

With nothing left in the way
I've never felt this way before
I fear I'll never feel this way again
What do you need to feel from me
Take what you want
What do you see?

On the ocean and beyond
Amidst the others

I'm waiting impatient
An echoed existence

The dull light lingers
The candle flickers
Beside you in the red
The beat of nameless songs
The pulsing flame goes on

But I am not there

The faces unfamiliar
I've never felt so close
A flickered little moment that goes on
That leaves me so sore"

That would fire up her snatch

I was no match
I was fired from her crotch

The mermaids sun themselves out on the rocks
They are beyond our touch
I watch and watch
Them wave at me, wave at me
They wave and slip back into the sea

All the ones who come
And all the ones who go down to the water
All the ones who come
And all the ones who go down to the sea

I believe in God
I believe in mermaids too
I believe in seventy two virgins on a chain
Why not, why not
I believe in the rapture
For I've seen your face
On the floor of the ocean
At the bottom of the rain

I do driver alertness course
I do husband alertness course
I do mermaid alertness course
I watch them out on the rocks
They wave at me, wave at me
They wave and slip back into the sea

All the ones who come
All the ones who go down to the water
And all the ones who come
And all the ones who go down to the sea
For all the ones who come
And all the ones who go down to the water
For the ones who come
And all the ones who go down to the sea"

Over the kingdom wall, she's climbing...

But i can't find my way down...

Keep my feet from the ground

me,atmosphere,"Yeah, the child in the mirror was homely
So he learned early on how to switch into low-key
Little person, observant and accurate
Grew the skills to argue and the passion to back it with
Kick over the blocks just to re-build them
Cause mom and pop used to pop
Sound familiar?
Daddy had to leave, but Mama kept hurtin'
So we stepped up to help
Be an anger and a burden
And right around the same time
Started noticing girls, but they wouldn't pay him any mind
And if they ever did, he got nervous
You shoulda seen him practice on his hand for his first kiss
Even though he was too young to hunt and gather
Hungry puppy had to learn how to front and swagger
It didn't matter, it was all self-esteem
At 16, you only needed one on your team
And mom and dad was never gettin' back together
So he was on some ""Baby we gonna make it last forever?
Basically married right out of high school
Five years of getting high and fightin' at a drive-thru
And when he hit 21, they made a son
But on his 22nd birthday, the relationship was done
Now he's got a best friend instead of a wife
But he feels like he stole the best years of her life
After that, it was one co-dependent to the next
A lotta love, a lotta hate and a little bit of great sex
Self-learning in between the self-loathing
Strangled in a cycle
Can't feel yourself choking
Some of them would overlap
Some of them would double-back
None of them deserved to be exposed
To the trouble that he posed
Strike one? Not even out of fear
He don't even do rough sex
You bite him and he's outta here
Make no mistake he puts the man in manipulate
And he's attracted to the women that reciprocate
Y'all can kick karma 'till it's getting late
Until Mama's little drama is the topic of the big debate
And nowadays the confidence is off the page
Cause women are attracted to that clown on the stage
He's only in town for a handful of hours
But Rapunzel wanna come down and dance in the flowers
Wanna make a smile? Wanna make a laugh?
Wanna make up for the mistakes in the past?
Wanna act like he doesn't know better
If payback's a bitch he'll be in debt forever
Insecure, Impatient
Temporary gratification, self-validation
That's what its made of
It's all true and it's the only reason he's even talking to you

You can try to fix my broken wings
You can know all the words to the songs I sing
But you don't need to know what's wrong with me
Unless you think you?re gonna come home with me"
mia,emmy the great,"The day that we
Took out the car in the rain
Is the day you forgot how to
Brake and see
How quickly the picture will change
Filled with voices and fingers and teeth
I still remember holding my hand
Against your face just before it was sprayed
Across the radio
As it played

And you and me
Are still but the scenery moves
Well why would it stop just 'cause
Suddenly
There's one where it used to be two
And everything's quiet but yo
Looks like the speaker lift through the blow
Still playing some compilation you made
Feels like a lifetime sitting alone
So i start humming along to the tape

I always liked this singer
I remember how you were the one who told me that her name
Was either mia
Or m.i.a.

And i am thinking
How many hours till i'm home
How long do i stay in this place
Who's going to wash all the blood from my clothes
Who's gonna cancel my date
Who's gonna cancel my date

And i think
I always liked this singer
I remember how you were the one who told me that her name
Was either mia

And i think
I always liked this singer
I remember how you were the one who told me that her name
Was either mia
Or m.i.a.

And the day that we
Took out a car in the wet
I thought to myself that the sky was blue
As i've ever seen it but yet
Still tinted with red"

[Chorus]x2
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
I hold the mic like a memory

There was a time when I couldnt find energy
The only person that was filln' me was Mrs. Hennesey
Ahh, it's like life was pinnin' me down
I used to go out on the town and get instantly clowend
You aint gonna be a rapper, you not a factor
You just a kentucky boy, get yourself a tractor
Chasing out the bogus dreams that you never acheive
That's when the liquer and weed became a need
Self-esteem was about as low as?
Asperations were about as big as Mertyl Urkel's titties
Then as soon as I started geeting some pride
My sister hydroplaned and died on ile 65
In a family full of pride, house full of tears
Spent many years with a blood stream of beers
Heart full of fears all jeers, no cheers
Till the rhythm in my ears make my mind clear

[Chorus]x2

Aiiyo, I hold the microphone enclosed in my palm
And go beyond the flows exposed in my songs
Can't grow fond of past memories
Cos negativity leeds the way to live with vast energy
Offended by the mental imagery
And suggest livin' in poverty was really meant for me
Paternal tendancies towards chemical dependancies had me thinking that all
My enemies were kin to me
And I can't begin to see how to control the flash backs
And progress past, all my style of dress got me laughed at
Thought I was passed at
But it attemps to reoccur when I don't proceive wat I feel I deserve
Being slurred by those not livin' in my position,
My thoughts tend to glisten, Just like I'm kinda pissn'
And when I thought I'd risin', life freeze's the frame
So I hold the mic like a memory to ease th pain.

[Chorus]x2

I sit back and reflect on the wild paths in my life
Only pain and heartache can feel my paths on the right
You know wat blasphermy's like, cursing the god
Cause you aint got shit it hurts and it's hard
Hell at times I steped it up to only stumble
Was forced to play tarzan in this concrete jungle
Most of my life's a daze got me forever lighting haze
Trying to forget the times, where I barely ate twice a day
For, alone and helpless, so when I only felt the shame
Sharing a twin bed in a homeless shelter
Few friends even then, most hommies is fake
Feel like a prisoner in my home pencil my only escape
I went from the block with my fam, to collage exams
But the pressures still there
Dog, I'm still scared
But I know it will all be right in the end
As long as I can focus my fears and channel my life through my pen"
michael,red house painters,"Michael, where are you now?

Somehow in my excitement the last time you called,
It slipped again to ask your hidden whereabouts
I got a lead from your old triple ex-girlfriend, she said
I heard he lost his mind again, again
I said i didn't know that you ever did

Michael, where are you now?

Sleeping through the morning in flannel impaired
Getting high in the southern air
Shoeless, sandy evenings down the unfamiliar
Last whiff of salt-water freedom
Skipping shells in the dead zone
With the ghost on your side
Of the state borderline
Whispering
Take it. . .

Do you remember our first subway ride?
Our first heavy metal haircuts?
Our last swim on the east coast?
And me with my ridiculous looking pierced nose?
I remember your warm smile in the sun
The daydreaming boy without a shirt on
The birmingham barfly father
Left the mother of three sons
You're the oldest juvenile delinquent bum
My best friend"

To give you something to go on

And then they spit me out
And I'm not supposed to let it bother me

Waiting for a bit of you, baby

Shadows pull my hands towards the light
Will I try in time

Are always there
Your eyes
Are what I came for
Your eyes
They just drive away my fear
Your eyes
I could just stand there and adore

Stop just right there
Everything has to stop to steal time
From whom I wanna be near
And yes I do care
'Cause I love the love we share

And I know you're alive
'Cause I give my heart to survive
This world has nothing to offer a human soul

To hide away in the secret space of my heart
Will I try in time
Will I try with my feet on the ground
Shadows pull my hands towards the light
Will I try in time

Seems there is nothing to remind me of peace
Down here
How come that all I feel is
Joy

Will I try
To hide away in the secret space of my heart
Will I try in time
Will I try
To hide away in the secret space of my heart

My sorry name has made it to graffiti

Not anymore, dear

The streets, an empty stage
The city sirens violins
Everything has changed

So lift off love

We took the town to town last night
We kissed like we invented it
And now I know what every step is for
To lead me to your door

Know that while you sleep
Everything has changed

We made the moon our mirrorball
The streets, an empty stage
The city sirens violins

missing pieces,boris,"Canaries sing themselves out, way too hoarse
Their wings move as if choreographed
They are just acting each other - the missing, the imagined
They are only singing about how much more yearning they can hold

Mirrors reflect ourselves, way too clearly
The stares, directed another way, are cuddling together
They are just pitying each other - the reflections on the mirror
They are only pretending as if they are going around something

Next comes the lies, pieces of you, falling into place
Again you are used, made to feel you've found it out
You are for ever made to watch the same scene
At the same place, over and over: missing pieces
And you know you'll never find them: missing pieces""

-All the Missing passing me by
""At least I would like to stop them.""
""I am lonely... Ah.""
-Chasing its back
""I would like to keep holding this 'should be there""

Already faded away

I didn't even get one last kiss, from you
Oh baby God took your love from me
You needed an angel so it seems
I need to feel your hands all over me
I need to feel you kissing me
I need to feel you holding me
I need to feel your touch
'Cause I miss your love so much
And I can't keep on living this way
I need you here with me
Why did he take you away, from me

It's hard for me to tell you I love you
As I'm standing over your grave
And I know I'll never hear your voice again
Why did you leave me
Why couldn't you just stay
Because my world is nothing, without you
Now I don't know what to do, with myself

I would've given you anything
Just to make you happy
Just to hear you say, that you love me one last time
I'd go to hell back over and over again
Just to prove to you how much I need you here
There is nothing that I wouldn't do
I'd cry for you
I'd lie for you
And there's no doubt that if I could take your place in heaven
I would die for you, yes I will
I would rather give up my life
Than to see tears in your eyes
I can't stand to see you cry

Knowing it was just one week ago, stood there and took that picture
There just one thing that I want to know
Why would God want to hurt me so bad
Does He know how much it hurts to be missing you
Baby I'm missing you

Would bring its hammer down on me
And pound you out of my head
I can't think with you in it

I'd drag all that I owned
Down the dirt road to find you
And my shoes, worn-out and used
They can't take me much farther
Ohhh

Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing

The sun burned a hole in my roof
I can't seem to fix it
And I hope rain doesn't come
Wash me down the gutter

Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing

She rides in a car
Like a queen on a card
And the guns of her mind
Aim a line straight at mine
To a heart that is broke
Tried to feel but got choked
In the smoke of a desert
A beach with no treasure
A night that seems blue
Feed the aching in you
And the background birds
Take a flight from the earth
A bonfire burns
And the night current turns
On a lifeboat floating
Down a river of sleep
Can't see her hollow eyes
Walking along with my boots full of rocks
Can't believe these tears of mine
I give 'em to you to keep away in a box

Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing

Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing"

Sure and short of breath
Could you carry on your business?

Do you already know
The way to my door?
'Cause you made your way inside
A dozen times before

Trick is to never look into their eyes
All the times, all the loaded times
And it? s belly up, and it? s hot, and it's cold
All the time, all the loaded times
And it fights and it lies, and it sighs
And it sighs, and it sighs

Don't leave me with these mixed emotions
And dreaming of you
Are you out there somewhere?
Burning with these mixed emotions
Thinking of you
Hope you're out there somewhere"
mockingbird,derek webb,"(vs. 1)
there are days i don't believe the words i say
like a life that i'm not living
a song that i'm not singing but to you

there are times that i believe i'm satisfied
like an intimate connection
despite this bad reception with you

(pre-chorus)
because i can't afford to pay
for most of what i say
so it's a lucky thing
that the truth's public domain

(chorus)
and i am like a mockingbird
i've got no new song to sing
and i am like an amplifier
i just tell you what i've heard
oh, i'm like a mockingbird

(vs. 2)
and yes, it's true that i need this more than you
like one whose name is many
have mercy, please don't send me away

(pre-chorus)
and i'll do all i can
to be a better man
oh i'll clean up this act
and be worse than we started

(chorus)"
modern world,david wilcox,"In the future that we used to imagine
The one they pictured in those old magazines
Their tomorrow-land is so old fashioned
A delusion of the modern dream

But they had a skyway to the city towers
And we're still rocking over stones and tar
I've been crawling down the freeway for hours
I want my fusion-powered flying car

This ain't the modern world that I remember
The one they promised all us boys and girls
This ain't the vision that the artist rendered
What happened to my modern world?

They said my leisure time was gonna be bitchin'
I'd have my holographic TV phone
And we'd be cooking in our one button kitchen
In our aluminum dymaxion home

With the enlightened ones leading the nations
Bringing peace around the world at last
A utopia of cooperation
Where injustice is a thing of the past

It's just a bunch of big baby boomers
Trying to snatch the last cookie and run
It's such a comfort to the guilty consumer
If Armageddon had already begun

'Cause if the world's a box of chocolate cherries
Then they can use it up and toss it away
They make it post-apocalyptic and scary
To even dream about the future today"
modulator,neuroticfish,"A secret flesh to offer
A secret sign to receive
A secret pain to suffer
A secret kind of believe

Has never been good for me

mojo pin,jeff buckley,"I'm lying in my bed, the blanket is warm
This body will never be safe from harm
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin to keep me whole

If only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no mojo pin
To keep me satisfied

Don't want to weep for you
I don't want to know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow
The memories fire
The rhythms fall slow
Black beauty, I love you so

Precious, precious silver and gold
And pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down we two to serve and pray to love
Born again from the rhythm
Screaming down from heaven

Ageless, ageless and I'm there in your arms
Don't want to weep for you
I don't want to know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow
The memories fire
The rhythms fall slow

Black beauty, I love you so, so, so

The welts of your scorn, my love, give me more
Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more

Well it's you I've waited my life to see
It's you I've searched so hard for
Don't want to weep for you
I don't want to know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow
The memories fire
The rhythms fall slow

Black beauty, I love you so"
molotov,greydon square,"The product of God & Allah is Osama Bin Laden
George Bush, Saddam Hussein just bottling problems
Stickin' dirty rags in the top and lightin' the bottom
Holdin it wit a smile to throw it into the crowd

Kaplow, its bigger than George Bush and Osama
Or if we ready for a black president named Obama
I'm tryin to fight my own indoctrination
They think they can stop an Atheist by sayin' he's prayin to Satan

Oh yeah, I fought the holy war in Iraq
So get ya facts straight before you stick your sword in my back
God Bless the troops, that's kinda odd
America only blesses you as a troop if you believe in their Gods

So where does that leave me?
They tell me to leave G
But at the same time they tell me America needs me
See I can deal with people pointing fingers laughin' at me
But if it's one nation under God then I'll happily leave

Try to draft me then, call me a draft dodger
And try and catch me I'll be the one laughin' then
Why would I accept a religion that my slave owners practiced?
At the same time keeping the gauge under the mattress

People comin' in masses
Reverends & chaplains
Buddhists, Hindus, & Catholics
Even heaven's assassins
Secret organizations that convene at the Vatican
To discuss how to either convert or beat up the pacifists

I'm the Malcolm X of Atheism
By any means necessary take it to em'
This how I'll break it to em'

Your God is logically impossible
And can't even survive the most basic logical obstacles
God of the impossible huh

It'd be impossible for him to be the God of impossible stupid
You really need to look at the facts,
Look at holes in your religion, look at the cracks
Infinite Regression prevents a God from even existing

Let alone an intelligent one this is just the beginning
I'm Greydon Square and no longer am playin fair
I'm Kirk Cameron's worst nightmare, Cheers"
moments of pleasure,kate bush,"Some moments that I've had
Some moments of pleasure

I think about us lying
Lying on a beach somewhere
I think about us diving
Diving off a rock, into another moment

The case of George the Wipe
Oh God I can't stop laughing
This sense of humour of mine
It isn't funny at all
Oh but we sit up all night
Talking about it

Just being alive it can really hurt
These moments given are a gift from time

On a balcony in New York
It's just started to snow
He meets us at the lift
Like Douglas Fairbanks
Waving his walking stick
But he isn't well at all
The buildings of New York
Look just like mountains
Through the snow

Just being alive it can really hurt
And these moments given are a gift from time
Just let us try to give these moments back
To those we love, to those who will survive

And I can hear my mother saying
'Every old sock meets an old shoe'
Isn't that a great saying?
'Every old sock meets an old shoe'
Here come the Hills of Time

Hey there, Maureen

And hey there, Bubba
Dancing down the aisle of a 'plane

S'Murph, playing his guitar refrain

Hey there, Teddy
Spinning in the chair at Abbey Road

Hey there, Michael
Do you really love me?

Hey there, Bill
Could you turn the lights up?"
moments,red house painters,"Gently in these ragged folds
Curled up and warm like easter's child
A breath so faint, angelic weight

I can't deny
That i drift sometimes
Even in these loving moments
To summery fields i call my own
Where i can lie and in them feel
At one with my death
With limbs outstretched

I can't deny
That i'm weak sometimes
Even in my strongest moments
And the way you cry at me
I don't know why
You stay"
momma,abigail washburn,"Momma, please tell me truly
Even though life ain't what it should be
Where can I go to fix these things inside

Cause, momma, it's hard to feel free
When it's you running thru me
Just take me now or throw away the key

And so it goes...

Life isn't easy and truth's a dreadful beauty
And everyone wants to know where they go
When they die

Momma, I can't help feeling
That this pain is of your willing
Cool rain from a cloud of strickenine

But maybe, just maybe
This soul will die before my body
And I'll live on earth in peace for evermore

And so it goes...

Lately I've thought about me
Separate from your woeful morning
And I can see a light ringing thru the sky

It sings of coming glory
Strangely tied to this awful story
It lifts the heart and gives us wings to fly

And so it goes..."

monster mash,misfits,"I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash, he did the monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom, where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

He did the mash, he did the monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

The zombies were having fun, the party had just begun
The guests included Wolf Man, Dracula and his son

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, ""The Crypt-Kicker Five""

He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
He played the mash, he did the monster mash

Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist
And said, ""Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?""

It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, and it's a graveyard smash
It's the mash, it's caught on in a flash
It's the mash, it is the monster mash

Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my monster mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Model A sent you

Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash, and do a graveyard smash
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash"
monsters,electric president,"In through your window the sky will fall.
You'll trap the stars in jars and line them along your walls.
As the moonlight fills the veins beneath your skin,
You'll hear us knocking, oh, but you won't let us in.

Because you've got no friends,
And you've got no heartbeat.
Your insides are rotten now.
So there's nothing to fix.

But you said it often, before you were lost,
That it's only a day. That it's only a day.
But now you're a monster, and your backbone is soft.
Because you threw it away. Because you threw it away.

You called me out; I shrugged you off.
I don't have the time to watch you bash in all their skulls.
'Cause there's a new boss in town, his heart is black,
But his hands can reach through anything.
Stick your head in the ground. You might just dodge the guns.

But I'm not your friend.
And I will not fix you.
My insides are hollow now.
So you're all on your own.

But I said it often, before we were lost.
That it's only a day. That it's only a day.
But now I'm a monster, and my blood all runs cold.
Because I threw it away. Because I threw it away.

But now we've forgotten. And we've sold our blue skies.
But there's nothing to say. We'll be gone in a day.
And yeah, you can't take it with you. But I can sure as hell try.
Now there's nothing to say. I'll be gone in a day."

I won't do what they tell me
No I stay just the same
Tunneled all the pine trees
Still play a wasting game

I would never find in you

Frequent liar mileage
As if I had a choice

Limp to the edge of patience
And let yourself fall

Wearing out mirrors

more,madonna,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,
Which was fine with me
Because I had rhythm, music, love,
The sun, the stars and the moon above,
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.
That was when the best things in life were free.

Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,
Which is fine with me.
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,
But look at what I got to go with 'em.
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.
Who could ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.

Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!

Count your blessings, one, two, three
I just hate keeping score.
Any number is fine with me
As long as it's more!
As long as it's more!

I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition
I find counting a bore.
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.
(More! More!)

I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before
Got my guy and my sky of blue,
Now, however, I own the view.
More is better than nothing, true
But nothing's better than more, more, more
Nothing's better than more.

One is fun, why not two?
And if you like two, you might as well have four,
And if you like four, why not a few
Why not a slew?
More! More!
(More! More!)

If you've got a little, why not a lot?
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.
(More! More!)

Never say when, never stop at plenty,
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.
Happy with ten, happier with twenty
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?

Or does that sound too greedy?
That's not greed, no, indeedy
That's just stocking the store.
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.
(More! More!)

Each possession you possess
Helps your spirits to soar.
That's what's soothing about excess
Never settle for something less.
Something's better than nothing, yes!
But nothing's better than more, more more
(Except all, all, all) Except all, all, all

Lives unfold
Can't move on
So much untold
Shades of gold
We've been sold
Been deceived
While we believe

If today is all we see

Is just an illusion we believe

Strive to see
Hope to be
To be some small part of eternity

If today is all we see
Then tomorrow seems to me is
Just an illusion we believe"
morning,beck,"Woke up this morning, found a love light in the storm
Looked up this morning, saw the roses full of thorns
Guns are falling, they don't have nowhere to go
Oceans of diamonds always shine, smooth out below
Can we start it all over again, this morning?
I lost all my defenses, this morning
Won't you show me the way it used to be?
I've gone all around 'til there's nothing left to say
Wrote it all down into something that couldn't be said
I tore it all down and buried me underneath the wave
Can we start it all over again, this morning?
I let down my defenses, this morning
It was just you and me, this morning
I fought all my guesses, this morning
Won't you show me the way it could've been?"

mother nature,mostly autumn,"""Thankyou Rob, this is Mother Nature""

Time to look and see
In colours of time, we know who we are
Breathing the air that is sweet

Time to think of her
Here's to the lady, her eyes never sleep
With every weather that ends
Taking the towers and tables of land
She's holding the sky to defend
All of us

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries

It's time for love of her
Taken for granted, we know that you are
Alone with the cold of the stone
Painting your pictures on great Western skies
The world on its knees below
For all of us
All of us

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries out for love

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries out for love

In the golden fields, the rain
As the summer feels the change
In the mountains dressed in gold
The wind blows through her hair

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries out for love

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries out for love

Better get yourself where you wanna be
I think of all the days and night that I spent crying
And I move on

I've been in and out of favour with love
Because I gotta tell ya
I've been things I never wanted to be
And then some angel called me up
Told me I was sleeping
Don't waste time
'Cause even angels say goodbye

The hopes and the dreams

To pack his bags and escape this world

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on

He wanted to change the world, to make it all worthwhile
So he put his pen to paper and poured out everything inside
His red eyes tearing up at the man that he'd became
Slowly but surely on the fast track to falling into his grave

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on

I can't believe I've come so far in such short time
And I'm still fighting on my own (all alone)
If I stop to catch my breath, I might never breathe again
So just know this

I keep on searching for someplace, can't you see that I'm trying

I can't hide, because I'm six feet four
I don't fit, cause I'm too tall for the door
I hit my head if I forget and band aids I'm buying

Now it's the rain outside getting on my face
Or the foam from a glass of beer
Or the water fountain was misplaced
It is anything but a tear

No I'm not crying, I'm not crying
I don't have time to spend on that
I've got to keep on trying
I'm not crying, I'm not crying
I only want you back
And so I really should be flying
To knock on your door, Mr.Spock is no more"

Come out late at night and chase you around your room, room, room
You gon' call, you can call me, you know you can trust me
Without me you're headed to your doom, doom, doom

This kid's P.I.I., call me the whiz kid but not the F.B.I.
I'm on your side, I'm not the I Spy
You can go scot free, I'll be your alibi

I'm your sunshine concubine
You make it so easy for me to cry
I'm your sunshine concubine
My fears turn black in the moonlight

music,cat stevens,"Yesterday I was on the edge
Hoping everything was going to work itself out
A good honest man doing the work of God
Trying to make things better for Him
A lover of life in a school for fools
Trying to find another way to survive

New Music, Music, New Music
Sweet Music can lighten us
Can brighten the world, can save us

My friend said well, I think I found a way
To help make myself richer
I said dont you know, well, it wont be too long before
The bad ol devil will get you back
Back. I said put back your heart and sing, sing while
You know youre still living
Sing, sing, sing, while you know theres still

Chorus

Take a look at the world
Think about how it will end
There'd be no wars in the world
If everybody joined the band
Think about the light in your eyes
Think about what you should know
Thered be no wars in the world
If everybody joined in the show Oh Oh

Think about the light in your eyes
Think about what you should know
Thered be no wars in the world
If everybody joined in the show
In the show

my buried child,swans,"My frozen, empty, violent mind
Caressed the hidden hair that shines
With liquid lust I left behind
Your body stained with ruined eyes

I cut the skin, concealed the crimes
With liquid hate I left inside
And loneliness is buried here
In rotting holes beneath your fear

Your agony, your twisted struggle
Two bodies sink in meat-blood strangled
The smell of death, your tortured gash
Enfold me in your mother's arms

Now, hold me in your mother's arms

Now, hold me in your mother's arms (now, hold me in your mother's arms)
Now, hold me in your mother's arms (now, hold me in your mother's arms)
Now, hold me in your mother's arms (now, hold me in your mother's arms)
Now, hold me in your mother's arms (now, hold me in your mother's arms)"
my eyes,neil patrick harris & felicia day,"Any dolt with half a brain
Can see that humankind has gone insane
To the point where I don't know
If I'll upset the status quo
If I throw poison in the water main

Listen close to everybody's heart
And hear that breaking sound
Hopes and dreams are shattering apart
And crashing to the ground

I cannot believe my eyes
How the world's filled with filth and lies
But it's plain to see
Evil inside of me is on the rise

Look around, we're living with the lost and found
Just when you feel you've almost drowned
You find yourself on solid ground
And you believe there's good in everybody's heart
Keep it safe and sound
With hope, you can do your part to turn a life around

I cannot believe my eyes
Is the world finally growing wise?
'Cause it seems to me
Some kind of harmony
Is on the rise

Anyone with half a brain (take it slow)
Could spend their whole life howling in pain (he looks at me and seems to know)
'Cause the dark is everywhere (the things that I'm afraid to show)
And Penny doesn't seem to care (and suddenly I feel this glow)
And soon the dark in me is all that will remain (and I believe)

Listen close to everybody's heart (there's good in everybody's heart)
And hear that breaking sound (keep it safe and sound)
Hopes and dreams are shattering apart (with hope, you can do your part)
And crashing to the ground (to turn a life around)

I cannot believe my eyes
How the world's filled with filth and lies (how the world's finally growing wise)
But it's plain to see (and it's plain to see)
Evil inside of me is on the rise (rapture inside of me is on the rise)"

You've been locked out of sight all these years

Like me, My friend

Well, I've come home to find you waiting

my funny valentine,chet baker,"My funny Valentine
Sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
You're looks are laughable
Unphotographable

Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak

Are you smart?
Don't don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day"

You're mine and I know I'll find you
My head is my only house
Until I find you
I'll walk the meadow plains
Water deserts by my eyes until I find you
I won't sleep until I find you
I won't eat until I've found you
Heart won't beat
Until I can wrap my arms around you
Heart won't beat
Until I've found you
My arms are just two things in the way until I can wrap them around you
You can make a sad song happy
And a bad world good
I can feel you out there movin'
You're mine and I know I'll find you
And my head is my only house unless it rains
I hate to let other people hear me sing this song
If it reaches you before I do
Follow this song to I love you
That's where you'll find me
That's where you'll find me
Heart won't beat
Until I can wrap my arms around you
Heart won't beat
Until I've found you

my heart,jennifer hudson,"1, 2, 3, 4

What's up girl? Let me holler at you for a second
I just want you to know all of those other girls
They never meant anything to me
You're the only one for me

You turned me on, sounds so good talking fast
But before we go on there's something I should ask
Not about your past 'cause I don't care who came before me
No my maturity's bigger than that

I am more curious 'bout what you truly want
Do I sense sincerity or just good talk?
I don't care about the rumor mill but be understanding
How you truly feel for me and yeah I want you sexually

But I ain't talking 'bout that, ain't talking 'bout them
Ain't talking 'bout her, ain't talking 'bout him
I'm talking 'bout trust, I'm talking 'bout truth
I'm talking 'bout me and what I'm giving you

This is my heart, please take care
This is my heart, always be there
This is my heart, something's you can't take
This is my heart, so whatever you do don't break my heart

Some girls are satisfied with cash in hand
And some girls are happy just to have a man
But my heart has my word to never put her in the way of harm
So even though I like your charm

I ain't talking 'bout that, ain't talking 'bout them
Ain't talking 'bout her, ain't talking 'bout him
I'm talking 'bout trust, I'm talking 'bout truth
I'm talking 'bout me and what I'm giving you

This is my heart, so treat it like gold
This is my heart, pretend that it's yours
This is my heart, it's too valuable to bruise
This is my heart, so whatever you do don't loose my heart

One night ain't gone get you nowhere, there's so much to learn
And what you dedicate to me you'll get back in return
Now my bedroom game is sick and that's only the half of it
I need more, I'm tired of the same
Give me more, before you give me game

I ain't talking 'bout that, ain't talking 'bout them
Ain't talking 'bout her, ain't talking 'bout him
I'm talking 'bout trust, I'm talking 'bout truth
I'm talking 'bout me and what I'm giving you

This is my heart, so before you tell a lie
This is my heart, draw me a line
This is my heart, remember pain so raw
This is my heart, so whatever you do please don't break my heart

Ain't talking 'bout her, ain't talking 'bout her
I'm talking 'bout trust, I'm talking 'bout the truth
I'm talking 'bout me and what I'm giving you

This is my heart
This is my heart
This is my heart
This is my heart, so whatever you do please don't break my heart

This is my heart
This is my heart
This is my heart"
my hometown,bruce springsteen & the e street band,"I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick, steer as we drove through town
Tousle my hair, say, ""Son, take a good look around""
This is your hometown

This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown

In '65 tension was running high at my high school
Was a lot of fights 'tween the black and white, there was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night, in the backseat there was a gun
Words were passed, shotgun blast, troubled times had come
To my hometown

To my hometown
To my hometown
To my hometown

Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill 'cross the railroad tracks
Foreman says, ""These jobs are going, boys, and they ain't coming back""
To your hometown

Your hometown
To your hometown
To your hometown

Last night me and Kate, we laid in bed talking 'bout getting out
Packing up our bags, maybe heading south
I'm 35, we got a boy of our own now
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said ""Son, take a good look around""

This is your hometown"

I am searching the tide
In a vessel, in the storm
And you're the kind host, in the port
My lighthouse

And we'll be there to right our wrongs
In the time it took to write this song
And we'll beat the ghost with our bare hands
And we'll skin the corpse and we'll love and laugh
And we'll dance all everlasting day
And you'll sing to me everything I meant to say
And we'll drink to the gentle, the meek and the kind
And the funny little flaws in this earthly design
From the Reeperbahn to the Sundarban
I will heed your call from the dust and sand
And I'll save all my stories for thee"

my monkey,jonathan coulton,"My monkey gets busy, sometimes
My monkey's got a lot of stuff he's gotta think about
My monkey gets tired, sometimes
My monkey wishes he was something you could live without

'Cause every monkey needs alone time
To eat bananas in the sunshine

My monkey says a lot of things he doesn't really mean
My monkey gets lucky, sometimes

Waiting for miracles
And shaking with fear

Why don't you answer
Why don't you come save me
Show me how to use
All these things
That you gave me
Turn me inside out
So my bones can save me
Turn me inside out

You've come this close
You can come even closer
The gunshots get louder
And the world spins faster
And things just get further
And further apart
The head from the hands
And the hands from the heart

One thing that's true
Is the way that I love him
The earth down below
And the sky up above him
And still I go on like this
Day after day
Still I go on like this

Now I've said this
I already feel stronger
I can't keep waiting for you
Any longer
I need you now
Not someday
When I'm ready
Come down on the road
Come down on the road

My name, my nam
Nothing is the same
I won't go back
The way I came"
my oh my,macklemore & ryan lewis,"I used to sit with my dad in the garage
That sawdust that pine sol and the moss
Around every spring when the winter thaw
We'd huddle around the radio twist the broken knob
710 AM no KJR Dave Niehaus voice would echo throughout the yard
Couldn't have been older than 10
But to me and my friends
The voice on the other end might as well have been God's
1995 the division series
Edgars up to bat
Bottom of the 11th inning got the whole town listening,
Swung on and belted the words that started, Joey Cora rounds third
Here comes Griffey the throw to the plate's not in time
My oh my the Mariners win it
Yes, fire works they lit up ceiling in the king dome
We had just made history.

And swung, Lined down the left field line for a base hit!
Here comes Joey! Here comes Junior to third base!
They're gonna wave him in! the throw to the plate will be'.
Late! The Mariners are going to play for the American League Championship!
I don't believe it! It just continues! MY OH MY!

Laces woven barley holdin' that stitch
The creases are time amongst the grime and the grit
Where the leather he used to pound his fists
To some it's just a mitt, but see that glove was him
Yep, tell me stories on the field with that sun stained brim
Blood under my chin, he taught me how to spit
Sunflower seeds back when me and my crew sun burnt arms
Big league chew, yeah we were like the sand lot after dinner
After practice we listen to the M's in the kitchen
And if mom wasn't trippin' come on dad please I swear just one more inning
Voice went pump pump through the system break out the Rye bread it's grand salami time
My oh My another victory yes, my city my city.
Childhood my life watchin' Griffey right under those lights

Under that light rain gleaming in that night came, can't stop now
Keep moving no break pads came here to prove a point, live my life on the field
Make history in between the base path
And compete against the fear that is in me that's my only barrier and I swear I'm going to break that
From the mud the cleats that we drug threw the feet this is that moment and you cannot take it back
I don't really collect cards anymore, just a box and some old card board
Memories embedded in the dust, in the fighters that age just like us livin' some where off in the drawer
This is what you make of it yeah we play to win
Live it like we're under the lights of the stadium fight until the day that God decided to wave us in,
Right until he waves us in
It's my city my city childhood my life that's right right under those lights
My city my city childhood that's right Niehaus
My oh My come on, my city my city childhood my life that's right under those lights
It's my city my city childhood my life Niehaus My oh My Rest in peace."
my romance,carly simon,"My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of may, no twinkling stars
No hide away, no softly guitars

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true

My romance doesn't need a thing but you
My romance doesn't need a thing but you"
my shadow,keane,"It's time to make a start
To get to know your heart
Time to show your face
Time to take your place

In every speck of dust
In every universe
When you feel most alone
You will not be alone

Just shine a light on me, shine a light
I'll shine a light on you, shine a light
And you will see my shadow on every wall
And you will see my footprint on every floor

It only takes a spark
To tear the world apart
These tiny little things
That make it all begin

Just shine a light on me, shine a light
I'll shine a light on you, shine a light
And you will see my shadow on every wall
And you'll see my reflection in your free fall

Just shine a light on me, shine a light
I'll shine a light on you, shine a light

'Cause when your back's against the wall
That's when you show no fear at all
And when you're running out of time
That's when your hitch your star to mine

We won't be leaving by the same road that we came by
We won't be leaving by the same road that we came by
We won't be leaving by the same road that we came by
We won't be leaving by the same road that we came by"

my valentine,paul mccartney,"What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine,
My Valentine

As days and nights
Would pass me by
I tell myself that I was waiting for a sign
Then she appeared
A love so fine,
My Valentine

And I will love her for life
And I will never let a day go by
Without remembering the reasons why
She makes me certain
That I can fly

And so I do
Without a care
I know that someday soon
The sun is gonna shine
And she'll be there
This love of mine,
My Valentine

What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun is gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine,
My Valentine"
my way home,kanye west,"Yeah
(I'm on my way home)

They say home is where the hate is
My dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like vegas (I'm on my way home)
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to god that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke - in grassless jungles
Rubberband together in cashless bundles (I'm on my way home)
We wear struggling chains

Divided only hustle remains
Making sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game
It's another name
For life fighting
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson (I'm on my way home)
Hypes fighting for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he only get as high as he fell

Show money becomes bail
Relationships become jail
Children are unheld (I'm on my way home)
I wish love was for sale
Behold the pale
Horse got me trapped like R. Kell', I bail and it-

Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago
But no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never"
my way,samantha jones,"And now, the end is near
And I must face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
I saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I did it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

Oh
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my feel,my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it's all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no, no,no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a woman, what has she got?
If not herself, then she has naught
To say the things she truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
I did it my way"

myth,greydon square,"Jews hear my music and run out like holocaust is back
Europeans say this bloke can rap
Canadians say he off the map, how can you argue with that
Well you can if you have your own agenda
And been spoon fed religion from the placenta
Call yourself a christian muslim I know you do
Any religion bet it's the one your parents chose for you
And any admission of your doubts to someone close to you would not be accepted
Because forgiveness goes out the window when its someone different
And I dont know whats worse, that fact that I never believed
Or that I miss that community of church
There's two ways to control a population; hope and fear
Prove the existence of a soul and we'll go from there
Otherwise shut your mouth when you open it up to mention me G^2
Every human culture, has a set of creation myths
Buddhist muslim hindu xtian
Every human culture, has a set of creation myths
Jewish shinto pagan wiccan
(Sagan)
Every human culture, has a set of creation myths
(Greydon)
Voodoo deist Confucian Amish
(Sagan)
Scientologist Zoroastrianist astrologist
Spoon fed this religion from the slave ship
They used faith to justify bringing slaves here
All the conducts and the rules in the good book
You swear by it, but failed to take a good look
Just two centuries ago slave owners swore you didn't even have a soul
Now you blindly defend a faith
That was used plunder pillage and rape a whole entire race
DL Hugely's never met a black atheist
I'll never know a faith based on a factual basis
So we're even, from christian to islamic law
And now they speakin' up from Compton to Islamabad
They dont directly respond, they put it on their blog
Straw man attacks against me like I'm some kind of star
Huh, you pokin' at the hornets nest
I'll lyrically destroy your faith just to warn the rest
All this over poor explanations of nature
I'm Denzel in Glory, for shoes i'll make it a caper
I have the scars of a slave in my DNA
So forgive me if I dont preach the faith like TD Jakes
See, I could never go to bed with said fiction
Because genetic memory stores the trama of shed whippin's
Next victim, any faith thats ever suppress women
And skewed science and education for its best interests
...for those who died for daring to question the system
And all lives and power that they've abused since then
The stories were myth from the instant of its invention
That's where their power comes from, your belief in their fiction
From native american to native african
...from the evangelicals to the pacifist"

Not knowing who you were

My love will come, my love will come, my love

Oh solitude, it's all sublime

To wait while others play, to let my lover wait

nada,shakira,"Voy caminando sobre un mar de hojas secas
Vuelan los ángeles sobre Berlín
Van entonando junto a mí un aleluya
Mientras la lluvia cae dentro de mí

Extraño tu voz
Estoy en tierra de nadie, me falta hasta el aire
De espaldas al sol
Pasa otro día sin ti

No sirve de nada llegar aún más lejos
Ni toda la fama, ni todo el dinero
No sirve de nada si no estás conmigo
Y la soledad se me clava en los huesos

No sirve de nada-ah, nada
Na-ah-ah, nada-ah-ah
Na-a-da, na-ah, na-a-da
No, no, no, no

Nadie adivina qué depara el destino
Nuestro camino aún está a medio hacer
Tiro mi bolso Chanel del Barrio Chino
Al suelo mojado y me lanzo a correr

Extraño tu voz
Me hace falta tocarte, olerte, mirarte
De espaldas al sol
Acaba otro día sin ti

No sirve de nada llegar aún más lejos
Ni toda la fama, ni todo el dinero
No sirve de nada si no estás conmigo
Y la soledad se me clava en los huesos

No sirve de nada-ah, nada

narcosis,colosseum,"Diving into prodigious landscape beyond experience
Stars have died in this desolate wasteland of infinity
Limits collide and shatter into endless parallels
Physical form has ceased to exist, only spirit without carrying form

Outside the form as the breath of howling winds and darkness
The world never appeared in reality nor even a wretched dream
Black holes open wide in between the galaxies unseen
The conciousness has escaped from its bounding walls

Open wide the gates to unreality...
Disappear into the waving stream...
Darkness as your guide.
Devil in your veins."

And you can't keep your hands off me, or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron

Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin'
Excessive buyin', overdose and dyin'
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurrin' the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his bell tower hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm your national anthem, boy, put your hands up
Give me a standin' ovation
Boy, you have landed, babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow, down, making me so wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how now? Take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success"
nature boy,david bowie and massive attack,"There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""

""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"""
ne me quitte pas,barbara,"Ne me quitte pas
Il faut oublier
Tout peut s'oublier
Qui s'enfuit déjà

Oublier le temps
Des malentendus
Et le temps perdu
À savoir comment

Oublier ces heures
Qui tuaient parfois
Le temps du bonheur
À coups de pourquoi

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Ne me quitte pas
Je t'inventerai
Des mots insensés
Que tu comprendras

Je te parlerai
De ces amants-là
Qui ont vu deux fois
Leurs cœurs s'embraser

Je te raconterai
L'histoire d'un roi
Mort de n'avoir pas
L'amour rencontré

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

On a vu souvent
Rejaillir le feu
De l'ancien volcan
Qu'on croyait trop vieux

Il est paraît-il
Des terres brûlées
Donnant plus de blé
Qu'un meilleur avril

Moi je t'offrirai
Des perles de pluie
Venues des pays
Où il ne pleut pas

Je creuserai la terre
Jusqu'après ma mort
Pour couvrir ton corps
D'or et de lumière

Je ferai un domaine
Où l'amour sera roi
Où l'amour sera loi
Où tu seras reine

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Je ne vais pas pleurer
Je ne vais plus parler
Je resterai là
À te regarder

À te regarder
Et à t'écouter
Chanter et puis rire
Laisse-moi devenir

L'ombre de ton ombre
L'ombre de ta main
Je ne dirai plus rien
Mais

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Ne me quitte pas"

A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise

She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can

Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything

She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hands

She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away

I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can

She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes and no one knows

Maybe i'm wrong, maybe you'll stay
Oh, stay here to wander beside me

Or the singin' of it's drivin' wheel

No I, never did no wanderin'

And it goes from here to there

As they go whizzin' by

Never rode on a river's rage

But I only had one night to keep you for myself
But you were made for something better, bigger than my hell

I will never let you go

If you get away but find me standing there
I will never let you go

There's a suitcase where your bag is sewed up from the past
And it haunts you like the ghost that's shackled to your back

You put me down but never out
You're off the list for showin' doubt
You can try but I won't crack
There's the door so don't look back
Here's the message for me to send
I'm stayin' here until the end

Maybe sell a tune and get wrecked after
Still razz gotta fat gold chain

Special kisses off a girl who's been on the third page

Yesterday is our tomorrow
And tomorrow is our forever
This constopulation will become alighted... or something like that

Modern life is rubbish if you know what I mean
There's no point in living unless you've got a dream
This song's for those who rely on luck
Who know the world is yours if you don't give up
It's a new day, let's start the uprising
Live in the now that's what I'm advising
Believe in yourself and don't give in to rage
50 hours a week on a minimum wage

A sweet for the kids and what their lives are missing
Living on a shoestring without a pot to piss/spit in
Some times are hard so i've got to explain
That you can find sunshine in the rain
Don't believe the hype life aint about wealth
You'll never get broke if you're true to yourself
The grass is greener and it's deep fuckin' purple
Back to the start now we've come full circle"

Have that life we always dreamt of
Wooden floors, chandeliers
And you can tell me I'm not dreaming

new partner,bonnie 'prince' billy,"There's a black tinted sunset with the prettiest of skies
Lay back, lay back, rest your head on my thighs
There is some awful action that just breathes from my hand
Just breaths from a deed so exquisetly grand

You are always on my mind x4

Well, I would not have moved if I knew you were here
Its some special action with motives unclear
Now you'll haunt me,
Till I've paid for what I've done
It's a payment which precludes the having of fun

And you are always on mind x4
But hello, I've got a new partner riding with me
Yes I'v got a new partner now.

Now the sun's fading faster, we're ready to go
There's a skirt in the bedroom that's pleasantly low
And the loons on the moor, the fish in the flow
And my friends they still whisper hello
We all know what we know, it's a hard swath to mow
When you think like a hermit you forget what you know

And you are always on my mind x4
I've got a new partner, riding with me x3
Yes I've got a new partner now"
new year's eve,first aid kit,"Well it's a new year
With it comes new hope and new fear
Met a young man who was in tears
He asked me what induces us to stay here
I said I don't know much
And I'm not lying
But I think you just have to keep on trying
And I know I am naïve
But if anything

That's what's going to save me
That's what's going to save me

Took a stroll around the neighborhood
Where the trees are swaying
People pass in cars with their windows down
With a pop song playing
A man walked by
Rocking back and forth the street
With a drunken smile to go along
He stopped to look at me and said

""Child, don't fear doing things wrong""
Yet I am still afraid
But if anything

That's what's going to save me
That's what's going to save me

Now I have a lot to learn and I'm starting tonight
Gotta stop looking at things like they're black and they're white
Gotta write more songs, love a little more, treat my friends better,
Gotta stop worrying about everything to the letter
And sometimes when it's too hard to get on
It just might be you that I'll come upon
But I find it hard to believe
But if anything

That's what's going to save
That's what's going to save me

Tell me tell me
Oh what's going to save me"
new york girls,steeleye span,"As I walked down through Chatham Street
A fair maid I did meet.
She asked me to see her home,
She lived in Bleeker Street.

Chorus (after each verse):
And away you Santi,
My dear honey,
Oh you New York girls,
Can't you dance the polka?

And when we got to Bleeker Street,
We stopped at forty four.
Her mother and her sister there
To meet her at the door.

And when I got inside the house,
The drinks were passed around.
The liquor was so awful strong,
My head went round and round.

And then we had another drink
Before we sat to eat.
The liquor was so awful strong,
I quickly fell asleep.

[Ah, come on, Min, play that modern banjo, Min]

When I awoke next morning,
I had an aching head.
There was I Jack-all-alone,
Stark naked in my bed.

My gold watch and my pocket-book
And lady friend were gone.
And there was I Jack-all-alone,
Stark naked in my room.

On looking round this little room,
There's nothing I could see,
But a woman's shift and apron
That were no use to me.

With a flour barrel for a suit of clothes
Down Cherry Street forlorn,
There Martin Churchill took me in
And sent me round Cape Horn.

[I say, are you a matelote? Careful what you say, sir - we're on board ship here.]"
next time around,emilíana torrini,"Then came question and it was about time
The answer came back and it was long
The house it was built by so men in rhyme
But whatever came of his talented son

Who wrote me a dialogue set a tune
Always you told me of being alone
Except for the stories about God and you
And do you still live there, in Buffalo

They put up the walls, no more to say
Nobody stopped to ask why it was done
The stream was too far and the rains to high
So into the city the river did run
Because of the architect the buildings fell down
Smothered and drowned all the seeds that you sowed
I wish I was somewhere but not in this town
Maybe the ocean next time around

I seem to remember the face and the name
But if it's not you I don't care
I know of changes, but nothing would change you
To Theo the sailor who sings in his lair

Then I'll turn and he won't be there,
Dusky black windows to light the dark stair
Candles will nod in the musty air
Oh, with the flames for as many as the years"

night air,jamie woon,"Night air has the strangest flavor
Space to breathe it, time to savor
All that night air has to lend me
Till the morning makes me angry

In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air

I've acquired a kind of madness
Daylight fills my heart with sadness
And only silent skies can soothe me
Feel that night air flowing through me

In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air

I don't need those car crash colors
I control the skies above us
Close my eyes to make the night fall
The comfort of the world revolving
I can hear the earth in orbit

In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air

I've acquired a taste for silence
Darkness fills my heart with calmness
And each thought like a thief is driven
To steal the night air from the heavens

In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air

Somewhere out in the midwest
I see the people out there waiting
Heart beating in my chest

And I'm thinking 'bout a woman
Who I put no one above
I'm not lookin' to replace her
Just need someone to love

While I'm out here on my night train
Drinkin' coffee takin' cocaine

Where the noise it never stops
Hammers pounding on the pavement
Whitles from traffic cops

Nobody looks you in the eye here
Walkin' 'round with clenched fists
I been searchin' for a simple place
Don't know if it exists

Sunrise out there callin' my name
I can see her movin'
I can see her movin'

Well at a certain time of night now
I become one with the wind
Where there isn't a beginning
And there is no end

Oh and everything is flowing
Everything is on time
I know that we're all going
To the end of the line

And I'm out here on my night train

It makes no difference at all
'Cause I wear boots all summer long

Some circles around my eyes
Sometimes the real color of my skin
Is my eyes without any shadow

And when I call
Will you walk gently
Thru my shadow
The ones who sing at night
The ones who sing at night
The ones you dream of
The ones who walk away
Capes pulled around them tight
Cryin' for the night
Cry for the nightbird... tonite

And so the winter is really here now
And the blankets that I love
I am surrounded sometimes
By too much love

And when I call
Will you walk gently
Thru my shadow
The ones who sing at night

The ones you dream of
The ones who walk away
Capes pulled around them tight
Cryin' for the night
Cry for the nightbird... tonite

Thru the net of the lace
In the darkness
It's hard to see her face
Pulls back the net
And you feel the touch
Of her fingers
And you see... she turns the eyes
And you see the eyes of a nightbird
The ones you dream of
Finally... the nightbird
Finally... the nightbird

Til the nightingale came
And sang a song for me

She'll sing above the blasts
And the clothing singed by fire
She'll sing above the black smoke
Rising from the funeral pyre
Her heart a field in bloom
Her heart a sacred snow
Her heart a mirror blinding
All the greedy as they go

I would not bear to rest
I could not dare to dream
Til the nightingale came
And sang a song for me

I cannot help but want
To solder all the parts
Solder back together
All the shattered hearts

We sold our souls, but couldn't buy salvation

We are all the shades of misery
The reigning champions of tragedy
They use their faith as a weapon, they count our sins by the seven
Blackwater at the gates of heaven
All hail the corporatocracy
The word of god written in binary
All hail our apostasy
The dying notes in an unholy symphony

All our gods have abandoned us
This is the great esoteric depression
We sold our souls, but couldn't buy salvation

I found god clutching a razor blade
He said, ""Look at the fucking mess they've made
They'd trade their hearts if they were made of gold""

no bad news,bonnie 'prince' billy,"Trouble, more trouble can you get anymore
Slow bubble boiling on the bedroom floor
Lonely ain't lonely, someone calling at the door
Someone lovely and she's bringing bad news

She clenches and she cries and she lays on the stairs
Pounding on the earth and yanking at her hairs
And showing such fear at being found unawares
To be here and be bringing bad news

Well, something bad happens and a lot of people go
Bad themselves, that's how awful it is
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
And she had to bring here this

Well, she's told, ""Hold your buttons and look at the sky
Someone will fix things if you let your face dry
Keep your face near the earth and your heart beat high
And you may transcend the bad news""

Well, something bad happens and a lot of people go
Bad themselves, that's how awful it is
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
And she had to bring here this

For all hammers and nails
For all leaves and winds
For all love ambitions
And enemies and friends

She shakes her face so fiercely that all her features go
She lays like a monkey unclothed in the snow
And her voice it decays and before it does she goes,
""I will never again deliver bad news""

You work a long hard day just to bill pay
With no time to play then what would you say
Still in this world and what it means to me

The Pleadies will smash out of Taurus

We should say how we feel
And I've felt so alone
But I know I've always got a home
The question I'm upserving
Is am I really deserving

Gamma waves bacterial plagues
Cow mutilations all the time
Not to mention visitations
More than 2000 years
Of fuckin' with our fears
The only thing true
We gotta love each other
Try to leep a positive vibe
They make it tough for ya
You're cut off and lonely
While you hustle for dough
We can overcome the wrongs
While we're reachin' the point
Stick together all forever

Stay with me, all day with me""

But my job was on the line
Should I say or should I go?
Oh, I just didn't know
I left fifty kids standin' in line
They were whining, they were crying
And their mothers they were screaming in hysterics
And I swear I never heard such profanity
I dropped my suit on the floor
They were trying to block the door
They were calling her a whore
They were driven to nativital insanity

You act so arrogant, you act like you're heaven-sent
And I'm not gonna let you get the best of me
Best of me, best of me, best of me, best for me
I'll find someone who loves me for me
For me, loves me for me, loves me for me, loves me for me

I should have never let you have my heart
You made me not wanna feel again
Made me scared to open up, but
Now I'm better off, no more bad days
Don't need you to validate me

No more (I don't need you)
No more (I don't need you)
No more (I don't need you)
No more (I don't need you)

No more (I don't need you)
No more (I don't need you)

Don't need you to validate me

No more (I don't need you)"

Gravity pulls me into
Anticipate our first touch
Sweet and so new
Let's figure out how to make this forever
Oh this is making me crazy

Hey love I am at the point of no restraint
Let's just make a move and feel the earth quake

It's just you and me
And no one else
It's just you and me
You and me

Slowly now
We shouldn't let this go too fast
Bring me out of this shell
Take off my mask
This is us intertwined and on fire
I cannot stop
I'm consumed with desire"

no other way,jack johnson,"When your mind is a mess, so is mine, I can't sleep
'Cause it hurts when I think, my thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make, chances we take
They're not yours, they're not mine
There's waves that can't break
All the words that we said and the words that we mean
Words can fall short, can't see the unseen
'Cause the world is awake for somebody's sake
Now please close your eyes, woman, please get some sleep
And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
We told each other there is no other way
Mm-mmm-mmm
Well, too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting, I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason
'Cause out the same door that it came
Well, it's leaving, it's leaving
Leaving like a day that's done a part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's just dead as the leaves
But at least we could sleep, it's all that we need
When we wake we would find our minds would be free to go to sleep
And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
'Cause we told each other there is no other way

nobody's child,traveling wilburys,"As I was slowly passing
An orphan's home today
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the children play

Alone a boy was standing
And when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like a flower
I'm growing wild

No momma's arms to hold me
No daddy's smiles
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child

In every town and village
There are places just like this
With rows and rows of children
Babies in their cribs

They've long since stopped their crying
As no one ever hears
And no one's there to notice them
Or take away the fears

Nobody's child
Nobody's child
Just like a flower
They're growing wild

Got no mommy's kisses
And no daddy's smiles
Nobody wants them
They're nobody's child

Nobody's child
They're nobody's child
Just like a flower
They're growing wild

No mommy's kisses
And no daddy's smiles
Nobody wants them
They're nobody's child

Nobody wants them
They're nobody's child"

She felt it everyday
I couldn't help her
I just watched her make
The same mistakes again

What's wrong, what's wrong now?
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

Open your eyes
And look outside
Find the reasons why
You've been rejected
And now you can't find
What you've left behind

Be strong, be strong now
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

Her feelings, she hides
Her dreams, she can't find
She's losing her mind
She's falling behind

She can't find her place
She's losing her faith
She's falling from grace
She's all over the place, yeah

She wants to go home, but nobody's home

nobody,five for fighting,"Take off your shoes... Take off yourself
Take off your rented mental health
Take off your raincoat... settle down
Take off your nightmare and your frown
There is a place for you to go
To see another ringer in a rock show
Take my pretense for a time
Cause I want to say to you

I'm nobody without you... buddy
My long lost friend

If you're not here to hear me scream
Am I silent like a dream
Where all the dragons are my friends
Each night we meet our bitter ends
Do I need you to make me real
Like Wheeler spinning his own wheel
Quantum strings within my brain
Popping sanities insane

I'm nobody without you... buddy
My long lost friend

Not everybody has a brain
Not everybody's going sane
Not everybody wishes well
Not everybody's heaven's hell
Sometimes there's someone to blame
Sometimes a place for shame
Sometimes good's better than bad
Sometimes good's better than bad
Sometimes good's better than bad
Sometimes you're better than me

Heaven fell on herself tonight
As the devil met me in the wishing well
And in that moment I found myself knowing
That in the end it's just about you and me
Nothing smaller or larger
Though dragons are good for the soul
Nothing can be better than baring yourself for another...
Open for scrutiny, ridicule, and indulgence
Therein lies the balls, and the mind, and the heart...
As fear is truly the Mindkiller...
When nothing is left...
Everything is gained...
You see I wish I was a poet
But I know as we go round and round
Though endings are never ever happy
It's the happy moments along the way
That in the end
Make it... ok..."

Y todo lo que sentiste fue

Todo el amor es desasosiego
De lo que termina por desaparecer

Y todo lo que me dijiste a medias
Son el lenguaje que no aprenderé
Oh y qué felicidad llenarte la taza
Y qué seguridad tenerte en la casa

Your motion I find so entrancing
Shall I stand next to your fire?
Smoke rings rise higher and higher
You are my angel and my plaything

If I'm your rose you are my sun and rain

On Sunset Boulevard
Much harder still
In Notting Hill
A northwind blows
And carries me home
Carries my heart, carries my soul
When cool silks they turn to suede
When young dreams are torn and frayed
The South feels so cold and grey
Today! Today the North's too many miles away
Today! Today I got to get away
I'm driving north
I'm heading home
I'm driving back
To the place I once belonged
It's all gone silent
The light begins to fade
One man unplugs
The penny arcade
And carries me home
Carries my heart, carries my soul
I'm driving north
I'm heading home
I'm driving back
To the place I once belonged
One sweet bouquet
The flowers strewn
The petals scattered
Here in the North
No dreams are shattered
I'm driving north
I'm heading home
I'm driving back
To the place I once belonged

No we don't feel betrayed

We don't remember better days
No we don't feel angry
No we don't feel betrayed

nostalgia,chance the rapper,"He should try enjoying life, rather than spending his time trying to outsmart me
While he's alive, that is
I know what you're saying but it's not that simple, it's just human nature
What's that guy doing, I wonder?
I still got orange and white cassette tapes
Tents where my neighbor came to spectate
Niggas that's tough now used to get little in the dark
It's all cool now, we're all little kids at heart
Accident prone chance, y'all remember 'bout
The time I cracked my head open at Auntie Linda's House
From diapers to outfits to castles to Elmo's
From Santa's to grandmas to Gameboy's and cellphones
Rocked your world, fourth grade talent show
Jada and Justin's birthday magic show
Games of tips taking niggas to school
Two quarters and I'll bust your ass at pool, on bull
Round here we lose best friends like every week
I like to think we playin' a long game of hide and go seek
And one day maybe I'ma find Terrance and I could lead them
Kids of the Kingdom singing about freedom
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
Let's take it back like Indian givers
To Indian burns and Jiminy Crickets
To the smell of Pillsbury on biscuit mornings
To puffy winter coats and Christmas mornings
I used to chill with the kids next door
And Sponge Bob came around 'bout four
And then I'd hang with Bart's guys
Around the bend was Smart Guy
Flipping through the picture books
Checking through my archives
Remember the old days, the ones you'll never get back
At the end of parties, passing around gift bags
Now we blow entire O's at one kick back
My fits and mismatch
That get off like wrist slaps
Remember Jeepers and Odyssey Fun World
Young pimpin' like you oughta see one girl
Mama Jann, mama Charlie, and my mama Lisa
Booster seat used to boost my kitty, Connie's Pizza
And every year we made a Christmas list
And Auntie Linda cooked a Christmas dish
And all of our grandparents made a Christmas wish
Like Lord, let me see another year like this"

Big girls don't cry

When you're gone nothing matters,
You gotta stop running away asking ""So what do you do?""
You gotta break through,

It goes on but I thought you should know,
You're not alone
When he was young,
He was living the dream,
He has it all,
Nothing can stop him now or so it seemed,

Lost control of the wheel,
It all went so fast can't remember the crash,
This all seemed so unreal,
Tough guys still try
There's a hand to hold,

This pain gets old like,
Cracks in stone,

Taking back control

He said, ""Tell me baby, what's wrong?""

You'll not what you want, it's everything
Not what you want, it's everything

Get my foot on the floor
Go eighty, ninety-five, maybe more
Tell me baby, what's wrong?

nothing at all,rob dougan,"I wanna be still
I wanna walk into your grave
Where I can shudder in peace
Until all our cares have blown away, yeah

Let the whole world fall away
And fall into my arms
Stay with me, I don't know how long we've got left
And so I'm asking you to forgive me
I learn as I go
To float far away into silence and just watch your face
And find some kind of grace
In that quiet bliss
Can I stay

And say nothing
At all, at all

Where will we go when we get old
When the bustle and the noise, get so frightening
When each and every angry word
Is banished to the past
That's when I think we'll learn as we go
To float far away, into silence and I'll watch your face
And find patience and grace
In each line there
Work each day
All for nothing
At all, at all

And the few words I say
They mean nothing
At all, at all

Will you walk into the grave with me
Will you leave this empty world, soft and wistful
To sink into the dark, dank earth
And never reappear, would be blissful
To float far away
Into eternal space, and God's silence where I'll watch your face
And find patience and grace
In each line there
Drift away
And end up nothing
At all, at all

Find the grace
To be nothing
At all, at all

Fade away
And end up nothing
At all, at all, at all, at all"
nothing even matters,lauryn hill,"Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world it seems so very small
Cause nothing even matters, at all
See nothing even matters
See nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
See I don't need no alcohol
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall
Without it I'd go through withdrawal
Cause nothing even matters, at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
No-thing matters at all
These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still there's no place I'd rather be
Cause nothing even matters to me
See nothing even matters
See nothing even matters to meee
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
You're part of my identity
I sometimes have a tendency
to look at you religiously
Cause nothing even matters, to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters
Said it don't matter, baby baby
Don't matter
Now you won't find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you it's never either or
Cause nothing even matters, no more
See nothing it don't matter
See nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Now my team could score
and make it to the Final Four
Just repossessed my four by four
Cause nothing even matters, no more

To me, to me, to me, to me to me to me"
nothing lasts forever,brett dennen,"I saw you spiraling
I saw you spinning back in time
Through all your memories
Such a quiet disease
You had forgotten me
But I'll always remember you dancing
Across the kitchen in your orange handkerchief
Such a quiet disease
I pray that when you dream you would remember everything
You know it all comes back to you
In one conscience dream
Maybe you'd sing and put words to all the things
That you think of in a day
But forgotten how to say
Nothing last forever
Not even the mountains
Someday they will be swept away and swallowed by the sea
We all shall be blessedly released
Life is so precious it's as fragile as a dream
And in a moment we all grow our wings
I wish to sing as if no ones listening
I wish to dance as if no one is watching
I wish to dance as if no one is watching
And I, give thanks for my dreams
You can rob me of my sight
And you can poison my blood stream
But as long as I can dream then life is worth living
Nothing last forever
Not even the mountains
Someday they will be swept away and swallowed by the sea
We all shall be blessedly released
Nothing last forever
Not even the sun
For all we know it could have burned out light years ago
Darkness remains the hardest thing for us to outrun"
nothing like you,frightened rabbit,"This is a story and you are not in it, uh huh
Fuckin' pages torn out
Here is a bedroom that you've never been in and
Here is your shovel, there's the ground

Look, two lovers covered in covers, uh huh
I can put us to bed tonight
I am bruised but she is dressing my wounds
Night nursing a broken man

She was not the cure for cancer
And all my questions still ask for answers
There is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you

After waking up post operation
I found I've come in a dream again
All the pain almost as painful as ever but
Something in me was not the same

At night during dreams of submission
I could claw back my heart and soul
As the size of the tumour diminishes
So it filled that black hole

She was not the cure for cancer
And all my questions still ask for answers
There is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you

She was not the cure for cancer
And all my questions still ask for answers
There is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you

There is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you
There is nothing like someone new

nothing's changed,chris isaak,"Let's take a drive through the old town,
Back past the place where we meet.
Some things are hard to remember,
Some things you'll never forget.
Let's take a walk down your old street,
Who lives in you house today?
Let's see if we can remember,
All of the vows that we made.
Kisses you gave me, the vows you made me.
None of these things have changed.
Nothing's changed, nothing's changed.
Young lovers stand in the shadows,
New lovers taking our place.
And though your gone I remember,
And I can still see your face.

Low static on the poor man's short-wave
Stampede's got to dismantle

Mission incredible undercover convoy
Full-tilt chromosome cowboy
X-ray search and destroy
Smoke stack black top Novocaine boy
Got so low your mom won't drum
Getting late with the suicide beat
Test-tube, still-born and dazed
Chump scum plays in the razor's haze
Got the momentum radioactive
Lowdown!
Circumcised for the operation
Don't expect some generation
Cyanide ride down the turnpike
Hundred hours on the miracle mic
Grinding the gears eighteen wheels
Rigs and robots riding on their heels
Fine tune robot making a sand box
Heats and infernos burning like Draino
Down the horizon purple gasses
Semi-trucks hauling them asses
Novocaine, hit the road expressway
Explode!
Novocaine! Novocaine!"
november,azure ray,"So I'm waiting for this test to end,
so these lighter days can soon begin;
I'll be alone, but maybe more carefree,
Like a kite that floats so effortlessly;

I was afraid to be alone,
but now I'm scared that's how I like to be;
All these faces run the same,
how can there be so many personalities?

So many lifeless, empty hands,
so many hearts in great demand;
and now my sorrow seems so far away,
until I'm taken by these bolts of pain;

But I turn them off, and tuck them away,
until those rainy days that make them stay;
And then I'll cry so hard to these sad songs,
and the words still ring, once here, now gone;

And they echo through my head everyday,
and I don't think they'll ever go away;
Just like thinking of your childhood home,
but we can't go back, we're on our own;

Ohh. . .

But I'm about to give this one more shot,
And find it in myself, I'll find it in myself;

So we're speeding towards that time of year,
to the day that marks that you're not here;
And I think I'll want to be alone,
so please understand that I don't answer the phone;

I'll just sit and stare at my deep blue walls,
until I can see nothing at all;
Only particles, some fast, some slow,
all my eyes can see is all I know;

Ohh. . .

But I'm about to give this one more shot,
And find it in myself, I'll find it in myself;

(Do, do, do, do-do-do) (x3)"
now and forever,the wild swans,"you haven't washed your face in days
and your cotton shirt is holy
you used to live your life so fast
now you find the days drag slowly
the only one that you adore
turns your woman ice berg blue
you blame it on the bottle now
boy has this town crippled you
no gulls flying
no fishes swimming
just lowered voice
and fallen women
it's cold at the sailor's rest
and your king of all that's lowly
you're praying on a phantom check
and the river's smiling coldly
you want the life you can't afford
after all that you've been through
soon it will be over
boy has this town crippled you
no gulls flying
no fishes swimming
just lowered voice
and fallen women
man and baby
and storm cloud weather
who counts your blessings
now and forever"
now that you're gone,ryan adams & the cardinals,"I ain't afraid of hurt
I've had so much it feels
Just like normal to me now

I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now
In your old room, in your old house
I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now
In your old room, but there's nobody there

Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone for good

Everything you ever touched
Is undisturbed and hangs out
Like crime scene evidence undisturbed in dust
I don't dare touch anything
Because it's evidence of us
And it means everything
Well sort of

I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now
In your old room, in your old house
I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now
In your old room, but there's nobody there

Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone for good

I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now
In your old room, in your old house
I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now
In your old room but there's nobody there

Now that you're gone for good"
nowhere near,tracey thorn,"Dog days of summer
Heat haze and bad temper
And whole days of shouting
""Would you listen to me?""

See, I'm the one in charge now
What happened to me?
I turned into someone's mother

Really someone should give me a uniform
Or someone should show me where is the door
Or someone should come around and explain
How it is that love forgets to speak its name

And then you turn on the news
And it's somebody else's news
And it's always such bad news
And I'm no good with sad news anymore
Gets me running upstairs
To count heads in tangled beds

And someone tears up that uniform
And somewhere gently closes a door
And I'm right here once more
Crying, confessing, counting my blessings

Don't let go
Cause we'll never know
That even when the sky is clear
And the moon looks really close
Well it's nowhere near"

No no, no no, I never can say goodbye
I don't, I don't know the rest
We those pros, we never procrastinate, ah
Them guardians they shouldn't let you get past the gate
Watch out dawg, the watchdog's showin' his teeth
Guess you bit too much, they bitin' your beat
While I speak from experience, hunger and hurt
And a little bit of hate from niggaz doin' me dirt
I just wash it all out with tide and show love
To those who ride with me while I'm puttin' in work
Full-timin' it, 8: 30 to 6, the graveyard shift
The three months before the benefits hit
But my position went temp' to perm', I sat and listened
Like an intern watchin' who applied get fired
Now I'm sittin' in the break room, they gotta make room
My paper stacks, put staples through 'em
So I can keep my money together
Some die-hard fans just don't want it like, ""Put Pos back on it""
I'm back on it, that's why you never disappointed
We give you what we live through for real
Don't own a crown but I'm royalty
And tryin' to see the royalty checks about a half a mil'
Whether off or on the chart, my cuts grips your heart
You know we got you open like your gut splits apart
I never pass the buck, my shoulder holds the weights
So don't beef when we don't pass collection plates
I don't give money, I don't support the needy
Schooled in America, taught to be greedy
And everythin' ought to be easy
But I never could say goodbye to my friends who get high
I wonder why, I'm rockin' with that guy, it's serious
Still make him cry when the satire's hilarious
Cold for your areas, flows come in various shapes and sizes
So hot that you despise it
Never last up to bat, no no, no no
These skills we don't lack, no no, no no
We never fall and pray, no no, no no no
Make all the ladies say, ooh ooh baby
You can't knock the hustle, no no, no no
Can't be budged by your muscle, no no, no no
Never ridin' on E, no no, no no no
It's De La and Butta V, drive you crazy
Yo, if you are what you eat, some of you cats head's
Between your girl's legs a lot 'cause y'all act too sweet
Go brush your teeth then after that
Put in a little more practice on your rhymin' attack
What you write's not the least bit hot
Maybe 'cause your wrist is so cold from all that ice you cop
Hate to hate a playa but you know what?
I still smother ya like cheese and rockin' leaves freshly cut
And we the steak and potatoes and De La's the greatest
And ladies be on the floor thankin' the Lord that He made us
I'm tellin' you, I swoop her like a pelican do
You sayin' look at that pelican fly, you spittin' gelatin rhymes
They shaky as shit, ugly in the mold you fit
We the square peg on the round hole, sound's soulful
Your imitation flavor is tofu
It's true we make our bed all day and we are
The world of rap, take you back
In the days of all four hundred ways that people lack
It's that, what, authentic, big-nosed mic music
Four to five survive all night to it
I'm tryin to keep up with my Jones' and Thomas'
'Til I'm broke like them New Year's Eve promises
And that's alright, I just penned another sixteen
To fill my bank account with the mixed greens
Moms want 5's and 10's
The girls I got is 9's and 10's, VH1 'Behind The Pens'
You anticipate greatness from elder statesmen
I ch, ch, ch, ah, like Biz Mark' or Jason
I bust one shot just to start the racin'
The tortoise and the hare, which one there is chasin'?
Slow and steady, we already Andretti
Get ticket take parades, waves and confetti and
Never last up to bat, no no, no no
These skills we don't lack, no no, no no
We never fall and pray, no no, no no no
Make all the ladies say, ooh ooh baby

Can't be budged by your muscle, no no, no no

Wie oft hat nicht zur Weihnachtszeit
Ein Baum von dir mich hoch erfreut

oasis,debbie harry,"How many times have you heard, how many times did you say
""I think I'm going crazy! you're driving me out of my mind!""?
We know it's just an expression, a silly little phrase
Not the doorbell, not a bird call
Koo koo

How do you drive someone crazy?
To where?
In what kind of car?
Maybe we find a road map
I'm sure it's not very far
We know it's not so serious
We take it all in fun
Answer the ding dong, do you play ping pong?
Could you?

Trying to get your attention
Did someone say earth's calling you?
Don't say it, don't ever mention, you're hearing more voices than two
Roasted or raw delicious!
Freeze dried or salted divine!
Was that a.
Are you a.
Are you?

Storms have rearranged the sand millions of years up till now
Crusaders on a never ending search die for a never ending thirst
What a fine perforformance, oasis!
Well worth the standing ovation
Not a mirage
Not camoflouge to you"
ocean drive,duke dumont,"We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding through the dark night
With half the tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love but it's never enough
As the sirens fill the lonely air
Oh, how did we get here, now, now, now, babe?
We see a storm is closing in
Pretending we ain't scared

Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought a fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought a fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

We're running all the red lights down
No way that we can stop, nah, nah
A quarter tank and almost gone
Pretending we're in love but it's never enough, nah
I wish we could take it back in time
Before we crossed the line, now, now, now, babe
We see a storm is closing in
I reach out for your hand

Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought a fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought a fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Hold on, oh, yeah, yeah, oh
Hold on

Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought a fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

offering,chelsea wolfe,"Holy life that you liken to nothing bursts at the seams
All the while stem the tide, I have seen it in my dreams
Here a fount in the desert, it was more than I could be
Human life as a lesson, you will see the mess of me

Hear it there, feel it swarming underneath
Oh, when love came for me, the blue and salton sea
A thousand lives lived in circles, a planet burning at the seams
Skeletal sand as a lesson that became an offering

River nigh, river light, sent us burning out to sea
Holy love, if you let it, never wanted it to be
You and I, you, a lesson, but never offered it to me
Human life gone wild, it was not enough for me

You and I, you and I won't grow
You and I, in our wild, won't listen
It was rife, it was rife with unholy offerings
It was rife, it was rife with the flowers of deceit"
oh dear,matt costa,"Early in the morning clouds are dropping on my head
Remind me the things last night I should have left unsaid

Away with the small ideas, I know I'm not the only one

So dear, oh dear
My head it tends to stray away sometimes I cant see clear
Oh dear, oh dear
In spite of all the things I said, I always want you near

Sometimes it rains, sometimes it pours
Sometimes I'm not that sure
But anytime you look at me
Your thoughts I cant ignore
The second hand would pass us by
Should one of us had blinked
But in a minute realize that true love always waits

My dear, oh dear
My head it tends to stray away, sometimes I cant see clear
Oh dear, oh dear
In spite of all the things I said, I always want you near

Early in the morning clouds are dropping on my head

You can make a clone an then you try to enslave it?
Stealin' DNA samples from the onborn

Sat on their park bench like bookends
A newspaper blown through the grass
Falls on the round toes
Of the high shoes of the old friends

Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends

Can you imagine us years from today
Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange to be 70

Old friends, memory brushes the same years
Silently sharing the same fears"

Impatient waiting, Way to hide a fall

Could I ever be a girl like her?

You can go and visit still

And if ever there's a way
To find a hopeful ray
Will I find it all today?

Will I ever be Olympia?
Could I ever have a cat like her?
Could I ever lie around all day
Eating chocolate and marmalade?

Now it's time to find the perfect world
Dress myself up like the perfect girl
Could I ever be Olympia?
Could I ever be in love like her?

In chaos of our lives
Can we ever find the time
To cherish feeling fine

And in the aftermath of pain
Can the balance be regained?
Can we ever be the same?

And now, time to switch off
Sit down, turn the lights off
Lie back, treat this sofa like your own

Look out, here comes trouble
Look out, we're in a muddle
Keep running 'til you find you've reached your home

Could I ever be Olympia?

To cherish feeling fine

And in the aftermath of pain
Can the balance be regained?
Can we ever be the same?

on our way,stereoside,"We were six years old
Sittin in the front row
Singing every word to every song
It's true
We got the rock an roll rhythm and blues
Well the record man screamin that rock and rolls dead
We think he should sell cars instead
He's a fool, they try to take away the things that are true

So if you care about rock
Just sit right there
We'll take your ass back to to the early years
Where the jams were tight
The kids could play
The music didn't suck
And the bands wern't gay

To waylon and willie
To hank and cash
To paige and plant to axle and slash
Litte bit of alice in motherfuckin chains
We miss you lane
Well he sure could sing

We'll be a hundred years old
Still in the front row
Singin every word with our devil horns in the air
Cause baby we were born in the year...

So keep the record spinnin all night long
We'll kick and roll high till the break of dawn with you
Cause thats what they would want us to do

So if you care about rock then sit right there
We'll take your ass back to the early years
When the Jams were tight
The kids could play
The music didn't suck and the bands wern't gay

To tyler and perry
And the brothers van zan
From the eagles and elvis
To stills and nash
With a little kid rock beat on the back yeah
Were on Our Way

They were rock stars
Livin life free of laws
They were all residents
On the cover of Rolling Stone
They were alll guitar slayers
They are rock and roll bands
They are stone cold pimps
Until the early dawn

Were on our way
Yeah

Goodnight detroit!

They were rock stars
Livin life free of laws

on that day,leonard cohen,"Some people say
It's what we deserve
For sins against God
For crimes in the world

I wouldn't know
I'm just holding the fort
Since that day
They wounded New York

Some people say
They hate us of old
Our women unveiled
Our slaves and our gold

I wouldn't know
I'm just holding the fort
But answer me this
I won't take you to court
Did you go crazy
Or did you report
On that day

I'm drowning in these feelings
And it's scaring me to death
Staring at the ceiling
So many things I could have said

I'm on the run

And I don't know which way is left
And there's no point in not being right

Everybody knows down ladbrook grove,
You have to leap across the street.
You can lose your life under a taxi cab,
You gotta have eyes in your feet.

You find a nice soft corner and you sit right down,
Pick up your guitar and play.
Then the police come and says move along,
So you move along all day.

I'm a one man band
Nobody cares or understands.
Is there anybody out there who could lend a hand.
To my one man band.

For three days now I haven't eaten at all
My my I must be getting so thin.
Soon my cap won't be large enough
To drop a half a crown in.

So hey there mister don't you look so sad
Don't look so I'll at ease.
I can play you any song you chose
To cheer up the life you lead.

Oh I'm a one man band
Nobody sees nor understands.
Is there anybody out there who could lend a hand
To my one man band.

And oh oh oh look at the rain falling
Oh oh oh look at the rain

Nobody hears the minstrel boy, as he sings his tale of woe.
Nobody sees him disappear,
And nobody sees him go.
So hey there mister don't look so sad,
Don't feel so I'll at ease.
I can play you any song you chose,
To cheer up the life you lead.

Oh I'm a one man band
Nobody sees nor understands.
Is there anybody out there who could lend me a hand,
To my one man band.

Oh I'm a one man band
Nobody cares nor understands.
Is there anybody here who could lend a hand,

I just wanna do half of what you do
And I know it seems so strange fot me to say this
If there is a hundred ways to say it
All in one, it means, ""Don't go away""

Everything is so unreal
Just say hi, and leave me
I'll let you get away

It don't need to know
It don't need to care
Whatever's hidden deep, deep down
Will be lost one day

Still everyday is a fine day
It's not much but it's enough.
If this is life, i think i'll stay
At least for one more day.

I wonder how will life be
In 5 more seconds from now
Will it be easier than this?
And will the skys be clear?

It don't seem to know
It don't seem to care
One day the time will come
The truth is near

Still evryday is a fine day
It's not much but it's enough.
If this is life, i think i'll stay
At least for one more day.

'Cause teacher
There are things
That I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger and I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes telling me ""No""
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song
I know it's wrong
Just let me go

And teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
Oh the last one I had made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye goodbye goodbye

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong you're not that strong let me go

And teacher
There are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh
So I don't want to learn to hold you touch you

one night,the game,"I only fuck with you on two occasions
When I'm drunk, when I'm high
I will be broke, if I would be with you
That is why it's for one night (one one one one...)(Chorus)

I'm a motherfucking gang bangin' Nightmare
Wake up mothefuckers, I traded in my white Nike Airs
For a red pair of converse, Back to the hood
My own niggas actin' like I turned my back on the hood
I used my rap money to put crack in the hood
Even brought the nigga Dr. Dre back to the hood
I show niggas the Bentley, then let you drive it
Gone for 2 days and I didnt even check the mileage
When we was fighting with Crips it wasnt bout no dollars
It was about selling dope to put our kids thru college
I'm sittin' on the block reminiscing for hours
Whipping my tears 'cause now half of my niggas is cowards
And I was still fuckin' with niggas
After I got shot and didnt get one hospital visit
My homie Snoop told me it be days like this
It hurt my heart to say this shit

I only fuck with you on two occasions
When I'm drunk, when I'm high
I will be broke, if I would be with you
That is why it's for one night (one one one one...)

Red bandanna in my back pocket I'm for real
This aint no pastel color kacki suit and I aint Pharrell

I don't front bout shit, I pull my gun bout shit
And let everything fly to keep my son up out of this
I thought you loved me nigga, talk is cheap
Remember, the bullet holes in my son's car seat
My baby momma found four shells
I aint get one keep your head up
All i got was keep it real, Keep it real my niggas?
Last year alone I spent 1.5 mil on my niggas
After the bullshit I stayed right there
Took you to award shows there go Jay right there
""Where?"" ""Right there""
I had you niggas in suits, cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs
I'm suppose to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear
The last 12 months been a fuckin' nightmare

This shit is worst then arguing with my bitch
I done been through more up and downs then an Impala swith
Get your hand out of my pocket nigga, go fish
I was born by myself so I don't owe yall shit
Nigga you tell me, what you want me to do
Drop my son off at home and come bang with u?
Oh now it's fk Game, Naw Nigga fk u
I put that on my life, matter of fact that's on Piru
And really is I can die too
And end up in the cemetery, right beside you
We can both ride, Angels flying over my head stone
But the devils inside your box
You wanted my shine so I gaved you ice
Then I gaved you a second change & you played me twice
Couldn't be a real homeboy to save your life
I should of took Dr.Dre's advise"

I took a ride with her one way ticket to love

And then she took me, it wasn't the same
Living is easy, life is a game
Both of us leading a life of despair
Searching for heaven, it wasn't there

So I took a ride with her one way ticket to love
Spinning my wheels around, I couldn't get enough
No destination, she's the girl I've been dreaming of
I took a ride with her one way ticket to love

But you sing to me over and over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray to be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I know now you're my only hope

Sing to me the songs of the stars
Of your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again
When I feel like my dreams are so far
Sing to me of the plans that you have for me over again

And I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray to be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I know now you're my only hope

I give you my destiny
I'm giving you all of me
I want your symphony
Singing in all that I am
At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back

And I lift my hands and pray to be only yours
I pray to be only yours

only human,damh the bard,"Isn't it crazy, isn't it cruel,
That a man can earn millions from kicking a ball,
While for other countries, we role a dice,
For a little clean water and a bowl of rice,
Politicians and empty promises help lessen our pain,
It's only human

Isn't it wonderful, isn't it right,
There's nothing as worthless as an animals life,
But it helps me feel better, when I feel ill,
I can't taste the pain in this little pill,
A thousand lives given to live just a few more years,
It's only human.

Cut down a forest for grass that won't grow,
To help melt the ice caps, to help melt the snow,
We'll watch the seas rise with nowhere to go,
It's only human.

Isn't is holy, isn't it good,
That people kill people in the name of their God,
A bomb for a Father, a bullet for a Son,
And a smile for the child that carried the gun,
Only one God can be right when all's said and done,
It's only human."

After all our fights,
That's where we both want to be.
You know that I've got my work,
But you've got your needs,
Straight back into your arms is where this long road leads.

You are my only one,
And when times get hard I've got to make you see.
You are my only one,
And that's not even half of what you are to me.

You're trying to keep up our home,
While I'm chasing my dreams.
I need to hear your voice,
But the telephone just rings.
Another night spent alone,
While I'm up on the stage,
In some Midwest town refusing to act my age.

You are my only one,
And when times get hard I've got to make you see.
You are my only one,
And that's not even half of what you are to me.

And it's a long road that leads me back to you.

See rain from the sky above

And now
Those tears leave a taste on my tongue
Like the warm rush you get from
Black opium

While I run
Is what's, is what's
Next on my agenda

I made a ruckus with a succubus
Before she knew I was amphibious
She threw her hands up and started to scream
""Man you look like your straight outta V.""

All I, all I wonder
While I run
Is what's, is what's
Next on my agenda

(Spoken)
And so it was that I, a wayward throwback to the Mesozoic, was enslaved as a circus freak to entertain you drunken monkeys. But Fate still had her twisted sense of humor and she granted me safe passage to sunny Florida, where for over the past 300 years now I have been breeding with an unheard of efficiency. And soon my progeny will rise up and say ""Hail Draco, king of the dragon men!""

I fashion my crown from Quetzlcoatl's quills
Build my palace in the jungles of Brazil
In the summertime come my children
""For I hail Draco, king of dragon men!""
I fashion my crown from Quetzlcoatl's quills
Build my palace in the jungles of Brazil
In the summertime come my children
""For I hail Draco, king of dragon men!"""
organs,of monsters and men,"I am sorry this is always how it goes
The wind blows loudest when you've got your eyes closed
But I never changed a single colour that I breathe
So you could have tried to take a closer look at me

I am tired of punching in the wind
I am tired of letting it all in
And I should eat you up and spit you right out
I should not care but I don't know how

So I take off my face
Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I pull out my tongue
Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong

I am sorry for the trouble, I suppose
My blood runs red but my body feels so cold
I guess I could swim for days in the salty sea
But in the end the waves will discolour me

So I take off my face
Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I pull out my tongue
Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I cough up my lungs
Because they remind me of how it all went wrong
And I leave in my heart
Because I don't want to stay in the dark

So I take off my face
Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I pull out my tongue
Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I cough up my lungs
Because they remind me how it all went wrong
But I leave in my heart
Because I don't want to stay in the dark"
origin,origin,"Slumber in death, we are unborn, absent of mind, time is a womb
Darkness
Out of the dark, into the light, luck and a chance
Spawning of life
Born into this uncertainty by chance, from origin inception of matter
Itself, all forms of life, born to be dead to live again
Then die
Constantly change evolution, born to be dead, dead to be born
Evolving is in harmony with death
Insuring the progression of all life
All things are born from the universe, and all things shall die!

Lifeless, inanimate, breeding inhabitant space
Resting eternally, dwelling infinity, lost but not
Endless activity, lasting divinity, time
Forever mystery, we have eternity for life and death

Evolving is in harmony with death
All things are born from the dead
Insuring the progression of all life
All things with life come forth from the dead

All life forms born into eternal emptiness have but one,
Just one chance
To be born into this well of eternity, born to die
Born to die
All things are born from the dead
All things with life come forth from the dead
All that is dead must give life, then all shall die"

our secret,beat happening,"I was walking in our town
I was walking through the store
I saw a pretty girl
She held open the door
I said I like you
She said that she liked me
And we could be friends
In our special stupid way

I went to Pacific(?) Cafe
There she was again
So I said hey
We should go swimming in Capitol Lake
We had a lot of fun but then it got real late
So I walked her home
And had dinner with her family

That's why we're running away
That's why we're running away
That's why we're running away
That's why we're running away
That's why we're running away
That's why
I had dinner with her family

We went to her friend's house
To have a cup of tea
She said that it was true
She was in love with me
I knew right then we had to be alone
'Cause no one in this whole world could ever understand

That's why we're running away
That's why we're running away
That's why
I had dinner with her family"
our song,taylor swift,"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walkin' up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again, play it again

Oh, yeah
Oh, oh yeah

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"
out of control,nothing's carved in stone,"I have copied you
And made up myself
So crash and splash
I fight
With my obsession
I feel the tension
A need for caution
I would like to show
Cut open my skull
Look into my head
I don't
Know why I'm so harsh
I could be so brash
I'm going to clash
'Cause I feel
I can always show
My everything to you
If this moment was for me
I try to hear
Lend my ear
Voices inside
One link to join it all again
All the things I knew
The world I trusted
Would be the same
If I
Remained inside my
Protective castle
And kept my eyes closed
Words are just a toy
That people play with
It's superficial
I know
The proof is out there
The hidden answer
That someone left there
'Cause I feel
I can always show
My everything to you
If this moment was for me
I try to hear
Lend my ear
Voices inside
One link to join it all
If I can
Go travel back in time
Start it all over again
Follow a calculated
Path to live but
One day I
Will come across the same
Feeling again and know
That it will carry over

'Cause I feel
I can always show
My everything to you
If this moment was for me
I try to hear
Lend my ear
Voices inside
One link to join it all
So it goes again"
out of sight,alphawezen,"Down by the hazy meadows
Under a sacred sky
Far from the city
Far out of sight
We wanted to meet
In the night

Behind the milky windows
Under the city lights
Already packed the luggage
We're down on the thoughts inside

Now I am waiting for the night
Now I am waiting for the night

Behind this milky window
There is no perfect night
Just a face on the pillow
Just a dream with the neon lights
Behind this milky window
There is no perfect night

Next to the hazy meadows
On the run empty sky
I lost my courage
Far out of sight
And wordless we passed
Each other by

Behind this milky window
There is no perfect nights
Just a face on the pillow
Just a dream with the neon lights

overdrive,katy rose,"Outta bed at the crack of noon
Blare the music and have a swoon
I can't stop thinkin' of your face
La la lee la lee loo lace
I'm six feet under the Bhodi Tree
With my crap new-age philosophy
Diamonds where there once were stars
I'm sittin' in Jayne Mansfeild's car
Yea yea-a I'm independence
Yea yea-a I'm borderline
Yea yea-a I'm California
My minds all screwed and upside down
But my hearts on overdrive (yea my hearts on overdrive)
I need to take a shower when I look at you
Ya sting and hurt like a bad tattoo
I wish you'd change my point of view
I cruise the canyon to get a breeze
With Hidden Treasures up my sleeve
I like the light and hate the heat
But I'll lick the blood right off your street
Yea yea-a I'm cherry cola
Yea yea-a I'm candy-eyed
Yea yea-a I'm California
My mind's all screwed and upside down
But my heart's on over drive
They all come here to find a scene
but end up girls on methadrine
naked on a TV screen
The dreams that fall beneath my feet
make my footsteps feel so sweet
But your kisses are my fait acconpli
Yeah, yeah
I'm independence
yea-a I'm borderline
Yea-a I'm California
My mind's all screwed and upsidedown

overflow,jon b.,"There's many tears and sad love songs
For all of those who lost to love, yes
Nobody seems to know why we do what we do
To each other when the times get rough, yes

I thought love was plain and simple, but, oh, what a lie
I've been counting on the one I love
It's not that love breaks my heart, you know love don't love nobody
I guess the level that I loved was too much

Ohh, I didn't know
Not to let my love overflow
No, I didn't know
Not to let my love overflow

You see there's not many ways around the mountain
For all those who choose to climb, yes
Sometimes it feels like no matter how far I get
The distance is all up to time

See I gave my love my only faith but, oh, what a shame
I felt wealthy with my bag of fools' gold
And there's a point when you know that your love's off the tracks
When the train stops 'cause the engine's too old

Ohh, I didn't know
Not to let my love overflow, oh, baby
No, I didn't know
Not to let my love overflow

I don't wanna say I lost my faith in love
No, I don't wanna say I've given up on my dreams
I believe in everlasting love, yes, I do
Just give it to me, what I want 'cause it's only you

Ohh, I didn't know
Not to let my love overflow, oh, baby
No, I didn't know
Not to let my love overflow

No, I didn't know
Not to let my love overflow, oh, baby
No, I didn't know
Not to let my love overflow"

p.s.,jean grae,"[Guy] Yo we gotta get outta here, what's taking you so long?
[Jean] Alright alright I'm coming, I just wanna send out
[Guy] C'mon
[Jean] I just wanna send a couple emails, just gimme a second, I'll be like 5 minutes
[Guy] Alright

[Verse 1]
Whats up vicky
Man I cant believe you wrote to me
The last time that I saw you
You even spoke
Remember on 8th street
Chillin' with Peter and he was all this my girl wanna meet her?
That shit was bugged right
Anyway... hummhumm damn is been a long time
I see you're still artistic, talented
Vicky listen
I did some foul shit to you
Even though it's passed
I vow to you apologies a thousand times
How could you, even look me in the eye then
You're a bigger person then I ever was
Or at least I'm trying
I should of never touched 'em
We should of never crushed and
Then straight lied to your face about it
No trace of blushing
But I was young and stupid
Shooting all crooked and keep it fucking up a friendship
For some ass, should of never pursued it
Just wanted to thank you for understanding and reaching out
Love Jean, holla back at your homie, peace, I'm out

[Chorus]
P.S. just had to get this offa my chest
I hope you're well, I really wish you the best
And as you can tell i've done alot of growing up
And time goes fast and no sign of slowing up
So if its any consolation karma got me bad
And anything I did wrong I wish I never had
I hope that all this drama we can leave in the past
Please feel free to write back

[Verse 2]
Hey marshall
I pray to god this is your email
Or else someone is gonna read alot of details
I hope you're doing well, matter a fact I know that you are
Probably married, pickett fence, kids, well, best regards
You always had it in you
Motivated, studious, impervious to outside influences that can ruin it
Anyways listen
I tried to reach out before
On the first record number 8, fuck it
It was hardly in stores, 2 days still
I bet you moved far from us
It was a long time ago, about five summers
I just wanted to say I'm sorry, sorry for cheating
Sorry I wasnt honest, it wasnt a good reason
You probably dont care but I still mean it
Still put it in the air and hope that you feel that I'm being sincere
You didnt deserve a broken heart
And I wish you the world
Love Jean, scream later at your girl

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Dear Jean
I see you're doing big things
Congratulations hey I even saw that big ring
Who would of thunk it huh? L-O-L
You even seem content
I notice that you're more focus
Drinking less is well
Anyways its been too many months having henny days
I think is plenty grave, plus you get your penny saved up
And say what?!? second album
Whatever happened to the thought of edging rapping
Still living in Manhattan?
Side tracking note, just on the low
All apologies, I used to hate your fucking guts
Please pardon me, tried to kill you more than once
I've acted horribly, and all my pessemism towards your life
Still bothers me
But you're a big girl now
You've fought and made it through
Best of luck homie
And everything I say is true
XOXO space smiley face dot dot dot comma much love, Hugh

[Chorus]

Ah cap locks, delete

[Chorus]

And send

[Guy] C'mon we gotta go, what's taking you so long?
[Jean] Alright I'm done, I dont bother you when you're writing emails
[Guy] Damn, yo we go through this all the time, c'mon girl
[Jean] Im doin business
[Guy] Alright alright
[Jean] Not really
[Guy] Come on come on
[Jean] You didnt know that
[Guy] Yea the cab's downstairs, c'mon

paint it black,lee mead,"I see a red door and I want it painted black.
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black.
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes.
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back.
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away.
Like a newborn baby, it just happens ev'ryday.

I look inside myself and see my heart is black.
I see my red door - I must have it painted black.
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts.
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue.
I could not forsee this thing happening to you...
If I look hard enough into the setting sun,
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes.

I see a red door and I want it painted black.
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black.
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes.
I have to turn my head until the darkness goes.

Painted black, painted black,
Black as night, black as coal.
I wanna see the sun, blotted out from the sky.
I wanna see it painted, painted black,
Black as night, black as coal.
I wanna see the sun, blotted out from the sky.
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black.
(repeat to fade)"
painting,atmosphere,"Ain't no color paint gonna cover the stains
The pictures on the wall will all remain
And even though he's home now sounding safe
Surrounded by the faces that he place his faith
The images visit from the past he witnessed
Can't stay away from the memories, sticks with
Each detail embedded in stone
Like he chiseled stoves convictions into his bones
The progress stops and pauses spits and sputters
Like the basement faucets
And it's obvious he's lost in his regrets,
You can smell it on his breath
Ain't no color paint gonna cover the stains
But now the alcohol is gonna mother the pain
Tuck it away, no complaints just laying on his back on his
Backyard under the rain
Take tomorrow but doesn't no how though for every swallow there's another to follow
He weaves his way throughout the story
Looking for a new missing piece or a door key
Spirits used to be for celebration
But now they just take him away from the hell that's waiting
Re-up until it's three sheets up
And pick a place for the skeletons to meet up
Ain't no color paint gonna cover the stains
But if the oxygen escapes it'll smother the flames
No introduction doesn't speak his own name
Gonna beat them demons at they own game
The sunset rides to the end slow
Same song echoing outside of the window
You can't grow if the skin don't fit you
Sometimes you gotta get low just to get through
No inspiration left to do your best when,
Nobody hates you more than you're reflection
Suffer the shame until it stuffs the drain
He's got two hands and a bucket of paint, come on"
paloma,celeste carballo,"Mi vida, fuimos a volar con un solo paracaídas
Uno solo va a quedar volando a la deriva
Vivir así no es vivir esperando y esperando
Porque vivir es jugar y yo quiero seguir jugando

Le dije a mi corazón, sin gloria pero sin pena
No cometas un crimen, mi amor, si no vas a cumplir la condena y
Quiero vivir dos veces para poder olvidarte
Quiero llevarte conmigo y no me voy a ninguna parte

No te preocupes, paloma, hoy no estoy adentro mío
Tu amor es mi soledad, estoy en un tiempo vacío
No te preocupes, paloma, no hay pájaros en el nido
Dos ilusiones se irán a volar, pero otras dos han venido

Si me olvido de vivir colgando de un sentimiento
Voy a volver para repetir cada momento
Te bajaría del cielo la luna hasta tu cama
Porque es muy poco de amor solo una vez por semana

Puse precio a mi libertad y nadie quizo pagarlo
Te cambio tu corazón por el mío para cuidarlo
Arpas de gloria, ¡qué bien!, quiero un pedazo de cielo
Para invitarte a dormir en mi cama o en el suelo

Un sacrificio virtual, bien o mal
Yo quiero hacerle a una estrella
Sin principio ni final
Yo no puedo vivir sin ella"

Now if you're looking for a lady to snuggle up in your bed
You'd better think about movies or pictures instead
For you don't make love in Panama
Until you've bought a camera
Standing up and down the sidewalks with duty frees in their hands
Showing off with a price tag to make you understand
That you don't make love in Panama
Until you've bought a camera
Any kind of little something that you wanna try
All depends on what you buy
For if you buy a watch, that will only keep her smiling
Bring out the old 'greenbacks', show us to your room
Let's make some movies, looking through the zoom into
Love, sweet love in Panama
Let us buy your camera
So if you go to Panama, look down the old street
Pick out the best camera and you'll get a real treat
For you don't make love in Panama
Until you've bought a camera
Ay-yi-yi, Panama!
Any kind of little something that you want to try
All depends on what you buy
For if you buy a watch, that will only keep her smiling

paper aeroplane,angus,"I'm alive
On this note

I spilled the ink across the page
Trying to spell your name
So I fold it up and I flick it out
Paper aeroplane
It won't fly the seven seas to you
'Cause it didn't leave my room
But it awaits the hands of someone else
The garbage man

Got to say mmm, mmm mmm
Got to say mmm, mmm mmm

So he opens it up and reads it out to all his friends
Amongst the crowd, a heart will break and a heart will melt
He walks on home tired from work
The letter falls from his hand
It reaches out only to catch the sky
It's gone with the wind

Got to say mmm, mmm mmm
Got to say mmm, mmm mmm
Go

Said, I spilled the ink across the land
Trying to spell your name
Up and down, there it goes
Paper aeroplane

It hasn't flown the seven seas to you
But it's on its way
It goes through the hands
Then to someone else
To find you girl

Got to say mmm, mmm mmm
Got to say mmm, mmm mmm
Got to say mmm"
paper doll,louis xiv,"Ah bang a gong or get it on
We don't need to take off our clothes to get it on
Pull your skirt up a little bit
Pull down your top and show me a little tit
I said, ""Hey short girl, you're like a midget
You can turn a phone cord into a widget""
She said, ""You son of a bitch you little bitch

I ain't gonna show you my love without a hitch""
I said, ""Hey hold up sugar just one at a time
Show me yours baby I'll show you mine""
She said, oh you're so pathetic
Yeah well so you're so magnetic
I said, ""Hold up girl I know your game
Ah you want a sugar daddy you can tame#instrumental

I said sing, sing me a song
And bang me like the girls in Hong Kong
I know I know I ain't correct
But politics are so much better when there's sex

I said, ""Rollover do me a trick
Do it with your shoes on it'd be a kick
Ah tell me the horse that you pick
Let me buy you a lollipop you want to lick
She said, ""Does that shit work with other girls""
If it does, why don't you find one of them to give you twirls
My love cost pearls
Ah does it baby - you don't say

She said, ""Hold up I know your game
You want a paper doll that you can tame""
I said, ""Sing, sing me a song""
She said, ""Well
Touch me like the boys
That did me wrong
You know it's ok, it's alright
If you want clean fun go fly a kite"
paradise,ana laan,"Please don't talk
My mind is out for a walk
Just go on touching me

Feel your way
Baby make my day
Just go on touching me

Paradise sounds pretty nice
But nothing could be better than this
Nothing could be better than this

Hold me tight
Honey you're getting it right
Just keep on loving me

Don't be shy
Your clever hands don't lie
Please please keep on loving me

Istanbul sounds wonderful
But nothing could be better than this
Oh no nothing could be better than this

Take your time
Hard and slow is fine
Lay your hands all over me

Make it last
There's no need to go fast
Just lay your hands on me

Hollywood sounds pretty good
But nothing could be better than this
Oh no baby nothing could be better than this
Your clever hands never lie
Nothing could be better than this
Don't stop now
Nothing could be better than this"
parallel lines,kings of convenience,"What's the immaterial substance
That envelopes two
That one perceives as hunger
And the other as food
I awake in tangled covers
To a sash of snow
You dream in a cartoon garden
I could never know

Innocent imitation of how it would be
If one the music entered, you did not retreat
In my imagination, you are cast in gold
Your image a compensation for me to hold

Parallel lines, move so fast
Toward the same point
Infinity is as near as it is far
Parallel lines, move so fast
Toward the same point
Infinity is as near as it is far"
paralyzed,bob mould,"An obvious display
Of feelings that have dissipated
And I don't have a clue where to start

You wouldn't let me near you
So I settled for the fear that you'd be
Happy with me six feet in the ground

I will crash when your mood defeats me
Circle of trash swirls around beneath me
I feel paralyzed most every time
You come around to meet me

Stuck in a place that I don't remember
Was it Sunday or last November?
I feel paralyzed most every time
You come around to meet me

Emotions vaporize
They disappear before my eyes
I wish for things that sadly have come true

So if I tried to make it right
And if I found my appetite
I'd eat away at all the pain I seem to bring to you

I will crash when your mood defeats me
Circle of trash swirls around beneath me
I feel paralyzed most every time
You come around to meet me

Stuck in a place that I don't remember
Was it Sunday or last November?
I feel paralyzed most every time
You come around to meet me

I will crash when your mood defeats me
Circle of trash swirls around beneath me
I feel paralyzed most every time
You come around to meet me

Stuck in a place that I don't remember
Was it Sunday or last November?
I feel paralyzed most every time
You come around to meet me

I feel paralyzed most every time
You come around to meet me
I feel paralyzed most every time
You come around to meet me"
pardon me,he is we,"Pardon me for my lack of excitement
But I'm not entirely thrilled
Stutter when I talk
Flail around as I walk
Yeah, the moment's been killed

And I'm not good at this, no, not all
I'm not good at this

I'm a wreck and I know it
And I tend to show it every chance that I get
Butterflies in the skies, they just fly on by
Yeah, they're making me sick
They don't flutter about, I'd do without
All they do is kick

Mean it truly
Sincere heart
Why do you do this to me?
Tear me apart

It's my fault and I know it
And I tend to blow it, no, thanks to you
It's like you sit and you watch me
You poke and you taunt me, it's all that you do
And I'm not fighting that, no, not at all
Just want to be something, a name you call
The lips you taste just to fall, madly in love

Mean it truly
Sincere heart
Why do you do this to me?
Tear me apart.

I got my eyes set on you
My heart is burning red
All of my words come out wrong
Run circles in my head
You had me and I melted
In the palm of your hand
You know it, yes, I felt it
You'll never understand

Mean it truly
Sincere heart.
Why do you do this to me?
Tear me apart

Mean it truly
Sincere heart
Why do you do this to me?
Tear me apart"

All the time! BT, guarantee each and every time

Now the old folks used to say: Nothing comes before the time
But silence is golden

Burning a million torches, all that bare your name
So in the darkness they bring you great light
Sonorous of black holes, you steal their flame
So I'm learning protection
For my self contained light
In a plethora of burning suns
In the blackest of pure twilight
And although I wish to give endlessly
I will not relinquish my sight
Let us linger in our luster together
Together in this Parisian garden of light
So in this perfect of hours, and in our silent of space
Pray the world grows perfectly still
Surrender to our silence, yeah

Let me come
Be still in your silence
Be silent and hopeful
Again
I'd like for you
To be still in our silence
Be golden in darkness
Again
Let me come"

passenger,deftones,"Here I lay still and breathless, just like always
Still, I want some more mirrors sideways
Who cares what's behind? Just like always, still your passenger

The chrome buttons buckle on leather surfaces
These and other lucky witnesses
Now to calm me, this time won't you please drive faster

Roll the windows down this cool night air is curious, let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees anything? I'm your passenger, I'm your passenger

Drop these down then put them on me
Nice cool seats, there to cushion your knees
Now to calm me take me around again, don't pull over
This time won't you please drive faster

Roll the windows down this cool night air is curious, let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees what tonight? Roll these misty windows down
To catch my breath and then go and go and go
Just drive me home and back again

Here I lay, just like always
Don't let me go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Take me to the edge"
passion,blackalicious,"An open microphone can be dangerous
Let's tune in on two of the greatest MCs out there

(Rakaa, Gift of Gab)

Passion
The will to win, the spark within
Passion
The strength within the hearts of men
Passion
The drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion
To play through pain and love the game
Passion
To break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion
The fight for rights to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion

(Rakaa)
Propaganda, positive propositions
Politician, musician and a triple optician
Still part of my missions to slaughter the opposition
Critics that don't get it, I tell 'em to stop bitchin'
I do without blacks, I've done it without cash
Strictly for the love of the art - that's passion
Flashin', rappin' or jammin' or soundblastin'
When Quannum meets Expansion, this is what happens

(Gift of Gab)
Runnin' through the jungle with a flare gun
Arrow-arms, zoning out my mind
Like I was hooked on hero-ine
Take the fire, turn it up and blaze whole forest down
Pullin from within' the inner insane warrior
California to the District of Columbia
Hella high octane, lookin' through a lazy eye
All ablaze, fire, flames, lightin' up the sky
Runnin' through the burnin' sun, yellin'
Ride, nigga ride, nigga ride.

(Rakaa)
Desire, the fire that inspires
I don't state facts, I state buildings, like empires
Passion
The journey, the learnin', the time-turnin'
The searchin', the mind yearnin' to wake and find morning
Passion
The ladies they love the long-lasting
Asking for action, braced for satisfaction

(Gift of Gab)
Passion
The black-skinned African jazz-men of the half in Aspen
Relaxed, gettin' my back rubbed

(Rakaa)
I'm still here, I've seen cats get killed here
I've seen cats make a mil but millionaires still fear
You can buy air play but you can't buy cheers
Blackalicious, Dilated, vibratin' your ears

(Gift of Gab)
Sent vibrations for years, I've been waiting for years
I've been patient for years, we ain't playin' this year
We hold stake in this here, it ain't safe for this year
We in the zone watch next level, takin' it there, this is

In her world, dwellin', hear the world
Yellin' for a leader

I don't bother with the dealers, I take it to the lab

patience,george michael,"It's like a conversation, where no-one stops to breathe
Is it my imagination, or did God already leave the table?
Such destruction, and pure white castles in the sand
No time for introduction
With all that money changing hands

And the satellite says, ""Take a look at all we have""
But the old man says
""You want my family, for your liberty... I can't do that.""

Look into the eyes of any patient man
Whether they be amber, green or blue
There's a piece of God staring back at you
But they see our children, and the old folk fend for themselves
They see our broken women
On imaginary shelves

But the satellite says, ""Won't you people look at all we have?
Don't you want it?
Can't you see the things that you lack?""
Children in his arms, he turns his back."
patterns,paul simon,"Oh, the night sets softly
With the hush of falling leaves
Casting shivering shadows
On the houses through the trees
And the light from a street lamp
Paints a pattern on my wall
Like the pieces of a puzzle
Or a child's uneven scrawl

Up a narrow flight of stairs
In a narrow little room
As I lie upon my bed
In the early evening gloom
Impaled on my wall
My eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life
And the puzzle that is me

From the moment of my birth
To the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow
Just as I must breathe each breath
Like a rat in a maze
The path before me lies
And the pattern never alters
Until the rat dies

And the pattern still remains
On the wall where darkness fell
And it's fitting that it should
For in darkness I must dwell
Like the color of my skin
Or the day that I grow old
My life is made of patterns
That can scarcely be controlled"
paula,zoé,"Yo sé que mentí, yo sé que fallé
Que te traicioné y que me alejé de ti

Tú sabes que eres mi otra mitad
Mi espíritu gemelo

Paula, no me olvides
Paula, para siempre
Paula, en el alma
Me falta tu mirada
Tu sonrisa dulce y tu cuerpo al despertar
¿Dónde estas?, ¿dónde estas?, ¿dónde vas?

Sé que te perdí cuando resbalé
Pero nunca jamás te dejaré de amar

pa,ryan adams & the cardinals,"Pa drove to town yesterday to pick up a friend
He found the locker she lay in
He drove to old man Ed Somerton's place
To finally disappear
He got there round about twelve
And he stayed 'till three
And the sun left him down in the valley
But the moon met him up in the hills by the lake
Reflecting the (?)
Suppertime came and went
No one heard from him

'Sis answered it
'Sis left his food on his plate
At the end of the table right next to mom's place
But nobody'd sit
Telephone rang about six
I answered it
I felt the news through the floorboards
Like a long Southern bone (?), like a wreck on the
Lake (?)
Like a joint (?)

So I drove to town yesterday
To pick up his bed
I found the locker he lay in
I drove to old man Ed Somerton's place
To find me some peace"

peggy gordon,sinéad o'connor,"""Peggy Gordon""

O Peggy Gordon, You are my darling
Come sit you down upon my knee
And tell to me the very reason
Why I am slighted so by thee

I am so deep in love that I can't deny it
My heart lies smothered in my breast
But it's not for you to let the whole world know it
A troubled mind can find no rest

I leaned myself on a cask of brandy
It was my fancy, I do declare
For when I'm drinking, I'm always thinking
Wishing Peggy Gordon was here

I wished I was in a lonesome valley
Where womankind cannot be found
And the pretty little birds do change their voices
And every moment a different sound

I wish I was away in Ingo
Far away across the briny sea
Sailing over deepest waters
Where love nor care never trouble me."
pendulum,broadcast,"Captured under hypnosis
Faster and faster images
Can a meaning be obtained
Or this mystery explained

I'm in orbit
Held by magnet
And the force fields
So much closer than love

Logic offers no defence
Underneath this influence
While this puzzle of intent
Holds emotion in suspense

I'm in orbit
Held by magnet
And the force fields
So much closer than love

Caught between the day and night
And a knot that pulls too tight

I'm in orbit
Held by magnet
And the force fields
So much closer than love"
penetration,pedro the lion,"Have you ever seen an idealist with gray hairs on his head?
Or successful men who keep in touch with unsuccessful friends?
You only think you did
And I could've sworn I saw it too
But as it turns out
It was just a clever ad for cigarettes

Cause if it isn't making dollars
Then it isn't making sense
If you aren't moving units
Then you're not worth the expense
If you really want to make it
You had best remember this:
If it isn't penetration
Then it isn't worth a kiss

And we're so sorry sir, but you did not quite make the cut this time
And we'd appreciate it if you cleared your stuff all out by five
Don't take it personal
Everyone knows you did your best
If it makes it easier you should look at it from our perspective end

Cause if it isn't making dollars
Then it isn't making sense
If you aren't moving units
Then you're not worth the expense
If you really want to make it
You had best remember this:
If it isn't penetration
Then it isn't worth a kiss"

Into ships, into ships

So sail away on your dreams
Unknown treasure in the hollow beams

They want to take my name away
I never want to waste away
They want me dead, don't end the day with them

That's how they win
They get you in the rain
And you forget about your promise

They want to take your crown away
200 years in your pain
I want to see my family
I wear the past as a second skin

Hey
You are a bird of paradise
Your songs are woven into life
Then when we get you out of it
I want to rise, to set alight

perfect girl,black lab,"Nobody ever, ever could tell her
What it's like to fall in love
Tired of searching, she wants to be perfect
Nothing's ever good enough
And i watch, i wait
Catch her eye and look away
Nobody ever, ever could tell her
But i tried

Now she keeps me hanging on the line
Praying at the sky
Every single night's the same
She's a perfect girl
Hanging by phone
Praying all alone
Everybody knows her name
She's a perfect girl

And she wanted to want me
Wanted to need me
Wanted all those distant stars
Wanted a surgeon, a full operation
But she couldn't bear the scars
And she cut me well
But she wouldn't be cut herself
And nobody told me i could be lonely
When i fell

I'm not perfect, what's a girl to do

perfect world,ace of base,"They say the time has come for us to start again
I believe that's true
They say the time has come for us to make amends
And I bekieve that too
Why tell me why?
Is it all so hard to find?
I pray each day

For a perfect world
Where children are laughing
Lovers romancing
Time stands still
A perfect world
There's nothing to cry for
No on to die for
Wonderful
In a perfect world

Our father's father says that things were better than
How easy they forget
On every page in every book of history a thousand tears were shed
There's hope in our hearts and love in our eyes
Day after day I keep searching
Why tell me why
Is it all so hard to find?
I pray each day

For a perfect world...

Show me the way I'm to understand
That you prove to myself that I'm a man
And you love, but you can't look from above

Travel cross the seven seas to be with you
Passion and desire will see me through
The road that I must travel will eind and curl
You're all I ever needed in a perfect world"
perfect,guster,"Played follow the leader
Keeping my steps in time
Counting on the wonder ahead
I leave the pain behind
It's on me
It's all mine
Go away
They're my mistakes
They're not your problem
Pinned down in this heaven
I'll die a thousand times
Aware of the damage ahead
I'll leave the pain behind
Another day
A perfect day
A twinge of pain
The sting of the needle
Starin at the walls provide
A brilliant sight through eyes of the needle
So warm at the bottom
Warm never felt so kind
And for a moment or two
I leave it all behind
It's on me
It's all mine
Go away, they're my mistake and not your problem
Black dog
White picket fences
Mow them down and dance in the rip tide
Face down in consequences
Crack me up and stay on your own side
Another day
A perfect day
A twinge of pain, the sting of the needle
Starin at the walls provide
A brilliant sight through eyes of the needle
I wish I may
I wish I might
I pray my soul to keep tonight
When all the walls start staring back
A perfect day
A sting for the last time"

White girls of the north
Filed past one, five and one
They are the fabled lambs
A Sunday ham
The ancient snow
And they could float above the grass
In circles if they tried
A latent power I'm known to hide
To keep some hope alive
That a girl like I could ever try
Could ever try
So we just skirt the hallway signs
A phantom and a fly
Follow the lines and wonder why
There's no connection
And weakened falling eyes
In cheap shots from the tribe
And we're off to Nemarca' porch again
Another afternoon
Of the goat-head tunes and pilfered booze
We wander through her Momma's house
The milk from the window lights
Family portrait, circa '95
This is that foreign land
With the sprayed-on tans
And it all feels fine
Be it silk or slime
So, when they tap our Monday heads
Two zombies walk in our stead
This town seems hardly worth our time
And we'll no longer memorize or rhyme
Too far along in our crime
Stepping over what now towers to the sky
With no connection

With plants

Chlorophyll cells take in carbon dioxide
Now that's the air that we breathe out
Combines it with water and exposes it to sunlight
And that's how plants can make their own food
Photosynthesis is why plants need light
And photosynthesis is why humans need plants
Because through photosynthesis plants make oxygen
And humans need oxygen to breathe

Please teacher, teach me something.
Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel.
That's not the worst.
My two feet haven't met yet.
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm going to learn to dance or burst.

GINGER:
Nothing's impossible, I have found.
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up, dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip.
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up; dust yourself off;
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired
'Til the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son.

Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again.
So take a deep breath;
Pick yourself up;
Dust yourself off;
Start all over again.

FRED:
I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang onto your hand.
Maybe by the time I'm fifty,
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Pick yourself up; dust yourself off;
Start all over again."

Weathered forever
Desperate clouds
Bellowing out
Seeing the future
Cautiously answer
It's only the plains
Sideways rain

The days whispered and shouted
And everything counted
The signs were around
We looked, so we found
Been seeking a pattern
None of it mattered
Watching the sky
Cycling by
Through windows of our past lives

We are seeing the same thing
But they are not laughing
The smoke from the engine
The bones of the plane
I notice this vaguely
But it couldn't contain me
And so i've been tamed
And so it remains
And i am ashamed
And hiding in the strangest hallway

Try to remember
Pen to the paper
Portion it out
What's it about?
The pictures are empty
Voices have left me
It's only the plains
Sideways rain
And i am ashamed
And i am ashamed
And every day is just the same"
planet x,(hed) planet earth,"""Planet X""

Honey, I'm home!
Would you come here and look at this?
There's something funny up in the sky!
Is it a bird? Is it a plane?
Honey, look it's your doom!

The Sky is falling Here comes Planet X!

The Mayan and the Hopi
Foretold it would come
The axis shift revealing
The Second Sun
It's time to face yourself
And all that you've done
And not done
Nibiru's on it's way
There's nowhere to run

The Sky is falling Flyby, shift,
The earth and many were lost
The powers of the world
Would just wanna last goodbye
The Family did survive
And took its first breath
Building our new world
We start once again

The Sky is falling Planet X is the force, needed to finally break the absolute control, that this hidden, reptilian race, has had over Earth since they won a battle in space, thousands of years ago.

Gaia was dying
But now she can
Show us her face
Darkness has left
Information
Will reign in its place
The gods hidden help
That the children
Could play on the beach
Five thousand, one hundred
Twenty five more years
To teach, and learn

Honey, I'm home!
Come out here and take a look at this thing.
There's something funny up in the sky.

The Sky is falling Planet X is incoming, and we're gonna have a global panic, but I and, others who have been understanding what I've been learning, are gonna jump for joy. I am going to be so happy, to see that planet. Does that sound crazy?"

You gotta get down, fight your own war

Who's that?
Your worst nightmare
A girl so driven
That's livin' in this world
That's right, your worst nightmare
A girl so driven
That's livin' in this soul

So pay the price! And close your eyes
And play the game and I'll make you cry
Come on
There's no way out
She's loaded but you can never trigger
Baby this is a rush so fast
So just you can't see me
Come on now
You know I got my body take a washing through my veins

Hah! Can't catch me now haha!
Yeah, better just break me now
Well G.O.D gonna punish me now?
Well you can never ever touch me now
Cause
I am the rule
I made the rule
You betcha I'm gonna own the night
Goodbye to the one last kiss
What's more loving than sound sleep?

Только тёмной мантии скольжение
Беды отражение
Я не заметить не смогла

Опять без правил играю
И на себя принимаю
Огонь, огонь
И это всё, что знаю
Я не ищу себе иную роль

Cегодня я просто player
Я ни о чём не жалею
Мечту свою мечту
И всё, что есть за нею
На карту мира смело отдаю

Опять без правил играю
И на себя принимаю

Тихо плыли в звёздной пыли
Небесные прожектора"
playmate,mc solaar,"Celle-là est dédicacée à,
À toutes les filles qu'on rencontre dans le train
Je suis le musicien, le mec sur le microphone
Fanatique de Rome comme Tifosi sous opium
Il faut qu'on donne le maximum sur le podium
Même si c'est dur comme l'iridium, nous sommes
Soudés à l'instar des grains d'maïs
Fatigués on résiste comme jadis aux franquistes, El Pais
C'est mon éthique, elle est plus stricte que les loubavitch
De Greenwitch Village soir de Shabbat dans un foyer Yiddish
Flow automatique. Illusion d'optique
J'ai vu la femme d'Elton John au Lavomatic
Puis j'ai rencontré une jeune nana dans le train
Je l'ai revue le lendemain avec des fleurs à la main
Elle verse des larmes, je l'apostrophe
Et dès la première strophe, je sens que c'est la catastrophe
Scènes de ménages, manèges. Elle déménage, s'allège
Elle a des fleurs et elle pleure son coeur est pris au piège
Je l'appelle Lise no good. Elle boude
Elle est comme une balle et le mec c'est Tiger Wood
La p'tite flippe. J'connais l'type. J'connais l'trip
Ne me quitte pas. J'connais l'titre

Playmate
Ce mec est un playboy
Un mister love mélangé à Castor Troy
Playmate
Fallait que j'te fixe
Il n'a pas pris la fuite
Il a six domiciles fixes
J'en suis désolé mais, je ne crois pas qu'il t'aimait
La journée il trimait. Et le soir il rimait
Le 8 mai. Il signait un deal, tu lui dis oui, mais
Arrête de l'ver les bras comme en 81, le 10 mai
Tu l'kiffais. Tu lui parlais vrai tandis qu'il frimait
T'es restée la même tandis que lui changeait, te brimait
Rouge Gemey sur les lèvres. Le soir tu fumais
Il est parti sans paix. Sans même allumer le calumet
Et dans l'TGV, vénère, tel la CGT
Elle regrette d'avoir même planifié le bébé
C'est un scorpion. Il les pique, toutes
De Krasnadar jusqu'à Knocke le Zout
C'est la vie quotidienne, ça se passe sous ta fenêtre, sur ta planète
C'est juste une question d'périmètre
Je sais qu'il reviendra. Sois forte
Si tu l'aimes ouvre lui. Sinon claque ta porte
Elle a rêvé de Californie, de lune de miel à Bali
D'aller visiter le Mali mais son visage a pâli
Son ex. Un playboy SDF
A 6 domiciles fixes de Brest à Budapest

please forgive me,david gray,"Please, forgive me if I act a little strange
For I know not what I do
Feels like lightning running through my veins

Every time I look at you

Help me out here, all my words are falling short
And there's so much I want to say
Want to tell you just how good it feels
When you look at me that way, ah
When you look at me that way

Throw a stone and watch the ripples flow
Moving out across the bay
Like a stone I fall into your eyes
Deep into that mystery, ah-aa
Deep into some mystery

I got half a mind to scream out loud
I got half a mind to die
So I won't ever have to lose you, girl
Won't ever have to say goodbye
I won't ever have to lie
Won't ever have to say goodbye

polly,keren ann,"Polly left on Christmas Eve
I will know as long as I live that it was all
You had in mind
She was turning 28
And I always thought it's too late to tell you
I never cried

There were so many ways to hide
In the hours of waste
And I will be
More than it takes
To you

It was different time and place
How we used to sit on the fence and wait for her
Like a game
Polly knew but never said
The very little time that she had was easy on that day

There were so many ways to hide
In the hours of waste
And I will be
More than it takes
To you"

Why shouldn't it be me?

Poor boy
Your wife is in hard labor
The rhythm you know
Is pulsing and drifting to the grave
When you come to
You'll be asking yourself just one question
Was I always this way?
Was I always this way?

Think back a year
When everything stood at the surface
But bandage you cuts 'cause you don't know what swims underneath

Hold tight
The bondage of this life is slipping
Why shouldn't it be me?
Why shouldn't it be me?

When I come back
You'll be the brightest star
In the black
When there are days
That you want the call we're all waiting for
Think back

Poor boy
Your wife is in hard labor
Go buy the flowers you'll leave on its grave
You went with the goal of movement,
Now one thing is different:
You don't want to change.
I don't want to change"
pop song,david sylvian,"Behind the iron gates
The shifts were workes in silence
Each weekend beckoned like Ulysses's sirens
And as the words were few
We'd listen to the radio
It was loud, and irritated me so

I'll tell you I love you
Like my favourite pop song

These promises won't keep
Though every road begins and ends with you
The fall still hurts, the bruise still blue
I'll paint you pictures of bright tomorrows
But the money goes and the time goes to

I'll tell you I love you
""Like the stars above you""
Like my favourite pop song

Wild, unwise, trivialised, untrue

We squander these gifts
Like another sunday supplement
Theres just so much cash in the hands of the government

I'll tell you I love you
Like my favourite pop song"
poppy,tv on the radio,"I'm not looking for a mommy
Don't seem like you need a poppy
Plenty of time till you're an old lady
And the same for me before I'm an old man

We could celebrate it monthly
How we stayed individuated
Oh kid, congratulations
You've held on to your dear, dear, dear identitiy
Even while spending so much time with me

I see two blackbirds in the yard
They are paired together
They are feeding
They are flying
They are fucking

I see two dragonflies do the same in midair
There is something special in the air

We wake up in the same bed
But with different bodies
God bless our separate heads
Oh, desire will run about

That's what the geese were all roaring about
The fact that our love
Is not that kind of love
Not that selfish love

Says what's yours is mine
And what's mine is yours

I don't need to turn you out
You don't need to turn me into your whore
We are not some rutting pair of wild boars
We're just psyched, so psyched
So psyched, so fucking psyched

That's what the geese are all roaring about
That's what their hearts were all open about

Our love
That kind of love
Unselfish love"

posters,jack johnson,"Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else
Because the posters on the wall they don't look like him at all
So he ties it up, he tucks it in, he pulls it back, and gives a grin
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all

He gets his courage from the can, it makes him feel like a man
Because he's loving all the ladies but the ladies don't love him at all
Cause when he's not drunk he's only stuck on himself
And then he has the nerve to say he needs a decent girl

Looking at herself but wishing she was someone else
Because the body of the doll it don't look like hers at all
So she straps it on, she sucks it in, she throws it up, and gives a grin
Laughing at herself because she knows she ain't that at all

All caught up in the trends well the truth began to bend
And the next thing you know man there just ain't no truth left at all
Cause when the pretty girl walks she walks so proud
And when the pretty girl laughs, oh man, she laughs so loud

And if it ain't this then its that
As a matter of fact
She hasn't had a day to relax
Since she has lost her ability to think clearly

Well i'm an energetic hypothetic version of another person
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in here
Well i'm a superficial, systematic, music television addict
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in
Here comes another one, just like the other one
Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else

Because the posters on the wall they don't look like a him
And so he ties it up he tucks it in, he pulls it back and gives a grin
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all

Sick of niggas lyin', actin' like they tryin'
To be kamakazi, when they scared of dyin'
No alibi, I got the power no one will testify
Take this lead shower and the black flour where you left to die, ooh
Still life is so soothin', it hurts to see you movin'
So I counteract, take a step back and start shootin'
Terror hit a hollow-tooth frame, you and your dame
So when he wind blows, your bodies whistle likes cranes
Call me by celebrity name, I readily aim
And hit you in your chest, now your shirt redily stained
If there's one I didn't gun down, believe he'll be run down
Because I'm killin' every nigga from, sun up to sun down
Finish them, all adversaries diminishin'

You got tough talk, but your walk, feminine
We startin' out wit' full clips, then empty 'em
From a pair of still siamese twins, that cripple men
We can handle this like outlaws to gentlemen
And I die for the love of the dough's my sentiment
But for now, we be invading your block and tenament
Opposite end of a glock gun, power, you ain't got none
Comply wit' every word that I say, your only option
And by full right, send your ass in full flight
Running over niggas like stampedes in bullfights
Power in our relationship, oh so intimate
Our love is limitless, we caress and deep kiss
Money's my only bitch so I get the stash out
Got me whipped on this shit, eat her and lick the ass out
We gon' live like it ain't no tomorrow in this shit
I'm going to wallow in it yeah, got her swallowin' my shit
Have wax and flames on her, whips and chains on her

The tenderest of care

Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

Angels with silver wings
Shouldn't know suffering
I wish I could take the pain for you

If God has a master plan
That only he understands
I hope it's your eyes he's seeing through

Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

I pray you learn to trust
Have faith in both of us
And keep room in your hearts for two

Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give"

High levels of tension
Shifts, to memory fragments, attempts
By means of the sense of perception

To confront these trivialities with ease

Like crossing a river by jumping its stones
Building a track, take him back to the other side

That is just when his brain peceives the increasing
Levels of tension
In the area of the sense

There where the sense of present tense
Prevails
To bring all that
That is aware
Into focus at one spot
That spot we call

Sliding down now
With the black lights shining

Black as the night is day filled with no sympathy
Marching down the hall for a misery
I don't care where you go you won't get away from me
You won't get away from me X2
Get away from me
You won't get away from me

Mouth tastes of sick
My stomach twisting inside
Everything's wrong
And I can't get away

The gravity of fear
You can feel it coming near
It's coming straight for you,
It'll twist and drag you down

I don't care where you go you won't get away from me

Marching down the hall for a misery

pretend,nat king cole,"Pretend you're happy when you're blue
It isn't very hard to do
And you'll find happiness without an end
Whenever you pretend

Remember anyone can dream
And nothing's bad as it may seem
The little things you haven't got
Could be a lot if you pretend

You'll find a love you can share
One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes, she'll be there
You'll never be alone

And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?

And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?"
pretentious,bibio,"You pretend that you pretend
You don't know that you know that you don't know that
You pretend that you pretend
You try hard to fake faking your smile
Hiding your hiding place in your own home
You will lie that you lie about lying
You pretend that you pretend

You profess that you avow
You were hoping that your faith is a way to hope
You amend what you amend
You act like you're acting to yourself
Thriving on hiding all your precious thoughts
You pretend that you pretend
You pretend that you pretend"

prisoners,regina spektor,"All of the prisoners serving life sentences
Wait for the earth to suddenly shake
For the walls to somehow suddenly come crumbling, tumbling, and
For the bars to somehow magically break

Aw, there's nothing wrong with them
That a thousand bucks can't fix
That a thousand arms can't hold down.
In the ground, they're tattooing the stones with
Cusses like cavemen—yo' momma was here

But they want to run through the air with no barriers or obstacles
Gunmen or guard dogs or priests
And to rise from the mud and start over and over
With the people all dead

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
If Hans Christian Andersen could've had his way with me
Then none of this shit would have ever gone down...
In my cell, I'm tattooing myself with
Mermaids and swallows, and though I do swallow
My mama thinks I'm grown, but I'm really still little and.
Someday I will remember
Someday I will remember
Someday I will remember"

Give that girl wings and that's all she wrote
Twilight zone
Twilight zone
I'm floating in the dark alone and
Is there any love out here let me know
A laser lights pinpoints the top of my dome
Then through my body
As if Scotty's beaming up a wayward soul
Mutant races in an ancient universe
Dark shadows humans rhymin' in a raggae verse
It's gone if you blink
I can see it as soon as you think it
Dancehalls crystal balls
On sidewalk malls
Psychic people outdoors reading palms
I believe that you know more
To survive the dimension if four

My pretty oh oh prisoner
Look at the way she's searching
Trapped in a world that's hurting
So bad it makes her cry
But I won't let her say good bye

I'm floating in the dark alone and
Is there any love out here let me know

Setting the pace of our stride

We raise our heads and look
When the bridges burn
We leave our homes in flames

This is the noise of our blood
Telling the age of our nerves
This is the price of our lies
From my lips into your breath

This is the voice of our past
Turning the tide of our lives
These are the tears that we cry
With my tongue I touch your mind

Free me from this great debate

Rearrange and see it through

Go where you think you want to go
Do everything you were sent here for
Fire at will if you hear that call
Touch your hand to the wall at night

puff the magic dragon,"peter, paul and mary","Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee

And brought him strings, and sealing wax, and other fancy stuff

Oh, Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist, in a land called Honah Lee
Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist, in a land called Honah Lee

Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princes would bow whenever they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name

Oh, Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist, in a land called Honah Lee
Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist, in a land called Honah Lee

A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys
Painted wings and giant's rings make way for other toys
One gray night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar

His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave
So Puff, that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave

Oh, Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist, in a land called Honah Lee

pumpkin soup,patrick wolf,"Sometime evening, I find a green spot in this town
And hide myself
Thinking of those circling skies
It takes me back to another time of Duffel coats
And drawing lines in the late September evening sand

The pumpkin soup on the table
The late September sun
A glow from the future
A sorrow yet to be undone

Autumn's brown sturdy fingers
Are embedding bouquets
Up and down your spine
Embrace the moment 'cause everything changes and all this will too
Today you debut your birthday bike on the hill
It's so beautiful, but things are gonna change

The pumpkin soup on the table
As warm as an evening sun
A glow from the future
A sorrow yet to be passed on

The circling sky of seagulls
The late September sun
I dream of a future
A dream that sorrow has undone
Undone

Pedal home, pedal home
Your mother is baking your favorite apples this evening
There's soup on the table but don't let it go cold, no, no, no
As you push your bike up the garden path, you turn to the ocean
You watch as autumn takes its last breath of summer
Its last breath of summer

The pumpkin soup on the table
The late September sun
Just dream of a future
And then the sorrow is undone"

You're hollow within
More how I'm to slowly
Let their harm
Give us some

Like flowers untamed
Shine out ends

Love me
Life is our find
Hollow is he

I can't breathe and I can't see
MTV moves too fast, I refuse to understand
You go your way and I'll see mine
Feels like wasted time
And it feels like I must be blind
How'd you like yourself?
You don't know yourself

To a hollow kind, don't mind
Love is some of you
Don't dabble in fall of failure
How bad, ooh, ooh

I smell of she and I fail to be
Well anyway, well anyway, well anyway

See how high
Go on

Don'tya know I'm a one man show

Raise your finger and I'll perform
Cracker-Jack till the crack of dawn

If you want-a see me do my thing

Pull my string
Pull my string.
Puppet man
Puppet man
Puppet man.

Baby
Baby I'm all you need

Satisfaction guaranteed

Any time you feel uptight

I'm at your service morning noon and night

I do what you want me to do

I'm a puppet just for you

If you want-a see me do my thing

Pull my string
Pull my string.

Can I come and visit?
I'll be at your house tonight

I can hardly wait to feel that pussy too

To hide that kind of pussy is a crime
You say your pussy's clever and so slick
But I think you're pussy's kind of sick

I wanna see your pussy, show it to me
Let me see your pussy, show it to me
Show me your pussy, show it to me
I want to pet your pussy, show it to me

I want to bet your pussy ain't as pretty as mine
I don't hide my pussy like you do all the time
My pussy's just the sweetest thing that you've ever seen
Compared to mine your pussy's really ugly and mean

I bring my pussy everywhere I go, mm-hmm
To watch my little pussy is a show
You say that your pussy's clever and so slick
But I think your pussy's really thick

I wanna see your pussy, show it to me

Show me your pussy, show it to me
I want to pet your pussy, show it to me

She turns into a tiger when she's ready to eat
My pussy's always hungry for a big chunk of meat
So lay your little pussy right next to mine
You can bring her over around dinner time

My pussy is the hippest thing around, that's right
She's always been the talk of the town
You say your pussy's clever and so slick
But I think that your pussy's mighty thick, meow baby

pyramids,noonie bao,"I've done my time of waiting
Done my time for life
I'm gonna leave and find my way out
You had me over thinking, but I've realized
That all you did was wrong, I was right

Have you been feeling sad lately?
You need my help again
Been kind of low and you, you need a friend
Sentimental words to me
Won't be the same again
Life doesn't hurt without you!

And now I'm on the top of the pyramids, unwind
And I'm never gonna come back down
So if somebody trying to take me out
Better not be scared of heights

I'm on the top of the pyramids, unwind
And I'm never gonna come back down
So if somebody trying to take me out
Better not be scared of heights

I used to run for cover
Running into the wild
I shut my mouth, and never ask twice
I guess it's hard to be brave when you're paralyzed
But now I see the truth in your lies
Or can't be feeling sad lately

You need my help again
Been kind of low and you, you need a friend
Sentimental words to me
Won't be the same again
Life doesn't hurt without you

And now I'm on the top of the pyramids, unwind
And I'm never gonna come back down
So if somebody trying to take me out
Better not be scared of heights

I'm on the top of the pyramids, unwind
And I'm never gonna come back down
So if somebody trying to take me out
Better not be scared of heights!

What you need from me?
What you need from me when all that you need is the love?
What you need from me?
What you need from me when all that you need is the love?

And now I'm on the top of the pyramids, unwind
And I'm never gonna come back down
So if somebody trying to take me out
Better not be scared of heights

I'm on the top of the pyramids, unwind
And I'm never gonna come back down
So if somebody trying to take me out
Better not be scared of heights

I'm never coming back down
Better not be scared of heights
I'm never coming back down
Better not be scared of heights

I'm never coming back down
Better not be scared of heights
I'm never coming back down
Better not be scared of heights"
pyramid,nightbox,"Started off as passion, turned into a fashion,
the sun's nightly journey lead us to the pyramids.
The sky has conceived us, you shouldn't have left home,
Now you're alone and I'm on the pyramids...

It was so simple
It was so simple

I'm counting crystals, in my sleep.
While you're sitting there, on that broken chair.
I don't even know, what colour it was.
While we're still young, let's echo, echo.

(Pyramid)

Scratching the surface, I did this on purpose,
it never snowed when we stood by the pyramids.
Burn all these paintings, they're all so tainting
each one looks the same, now we've left the pyramids.

So ordinary. Everything looks So ordinary.

I'm counting crystals, in my sleep.

quantum leap,tenacious d,"Since the beginning of time
There had to be a man with a plan
To push man, forward
There was a caveman who, invented wheels
And with those wheels he pushed man forward

Someone had to come up with a new concept for life
Had to push the mighty rock upon the mountain top

Got to work it out
Got to think outside the box
You got to think outside the bun
If you want to be the magic one
Who will lead the trail, blaze the rail
Be the one that you will know must me
Genius

Everybody looks to the hero to lead the way, to change our way of life
To show us something that is meaningful
When you look to the hero you must seize the day and shine a ray of light
Gotta shine it on something that is beautiful
With the bravery to see, a new form of arts
A blazing of our consciousness, we're talking quantum leap

When you think outside the bun
It's scary out there
There's also lots of stinky poo
But sometimes when you go outside of your comfort zone
You might find something brand new
To help the humans leap
Forward, do a simple leap
Never be they same, they leap
Across the f*cking annals of time
Quantum leap, leap

Einstein, Shakespeare, Leonard Nimoy Doctor Drew
Bell Biv DeVoe, François Truffaut, Moses Tenacious D

That's a list of the people who have made the quantum leap
It gets pretty scary out there because they got to know themselves, yeah
When you look at the people who have made the quantum leap
You feel like a turd cause you haven't accomplished anything yourselves, no
With the bravery to see, a new form of arts
A blazing of our consciousness,
We're talking quantum leap, leap, leap, leap

question,moody blues,"Why do we never get an answer when we're knocking at the door
With a thousand million questions about hate and death and war?
'Cause when we stop and look around us, there is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution that is burning in its greed

Why do we never get an answer when we're knocking at the door?
Because the truth, it's hard to swallow, that's what the war of love is for

It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way that you mean it
When you tell me what will be

And when you stop and think about it
You won't believe it's true
That all the love you've been giving
Has all been meant for you

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the the love I knew could safely lead me through

Between the silence of the mountains
And the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she's waiting there for me

But in the grey of the morning
My mind becomes confused
Between the dead and the sleeping
And the road that I must choose

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew could safely lead me to
The land that I once knew
To learn as we grow old the secrets of our souls

It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way you really mean it
When you tell me what will be

Why do we never get an answer when we're knocking at the door
With a thousand million questions about hate and death and war?
'Cause when we stop and look around us, there is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution that is burning in its greed

Why do we never get an answer when we're knocking at the door?"
quicksand,incubus,"Okay
Now the monster is awake
It won't
Rest until there's nothing left

Maybe ever and none
I forget about the pain

The flowers lean towards the sun

Some people fall in love and find quicksand
I hover somewhere in between I swear
I can't make up my mind."

Donde el viento es amigo, la brisa, un suspiro
Que abraza tu cuerpo, pequeña, al pasar

Quiero que tú me acompañes, mujer
Que mi canto amanezca dormido en tu piel
Y decirte al oído, sin miedo al olvido
Mis versos queridos, mis versos de ayer

Quiero perderme en tu cuerpo y anclar
En tu puerto mi barca vacía de amor
Escribir en la arena mi llanto y mi pena
Dejar que las olas borren mi dolor

Quiero que tú me acompañes, mujer
Que compartas conmigo tu vida y después
Cuando el viento en otoño acaricie tu sien
Estar juntos y unidos iguales que ayer

Quiero enseñarte un camino en el mar
Un lugar donde nadie ha podido llegar

quiet,john mayer,"Midnight
Lock all the doors
And turn out the lights
Feels like the end of the world
This Sunday night

There's not a sound
Outside the snow's coming down
And somehow I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind

3:02
The space in this room
Has turned on me
And all my fears have cornered me here
Me and my TV screen

The volume's down
Blue lights are dancing around
And still, I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind

Daylight is climbing the walls
Cars start and feet walk the halls
The world awakes and now I'm safe
At least by the light of day

At least by the light of day"

Jump out that - motor
Get in my flying saucer
I'll make you call me daddy
Even though you ain't my daughter
Baby, I ain't talking books when I say that I can take you across the borders
I'm young and free, I'm London G (I'm London G)

I'm pushing through just to make you melt away
Are you all alone? Is someone home?
Is there nothing left for us to take?
Cause if you believe, we can surely find a way
What more can I say?

Does it radiate?
Does it break your heart in two?
Does it take you down
When you don't know where you're running to?
Does it save your faith?
Does it ever go that far?
What else is it for?

We can run away, leave the world behind
The human race and this imaginary grace
(I can see us breaking)
Is there something more?
We won't know till we try
The future's open wide

Does it radiate?
Does it break your heart in two?
Does it take you down
When you don't know where you're running to?
Does it save your faith?
Does it ever go that far?
What else is it for?

Twisted bent turned around
Just about lost inside your maze
We can let it go and take a chance today
Are we better off on our own?
Nobody to tell us what we've got and what we don't

Does it radiate?
Yeah it does for me
I can take you down
It will knock you over to your knees
Let it save your faith
We can let it go that far, what else is it for?

Twisted bent turned around
Just about lost inside your maze"

Gather round

I prefer poor advice
And showed her the door

This is your goodbye in case opportunity
Thought you were burning me down, but I'm finally free

If you miss me, don't
If I never wanna see you again, I won't
If you get an invitation, I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'm in this situation

Oh the sun came up
Tell me, where'd I park?
We did it again
We had some fun, did some things, we got drunk
But I want it to end

'Cause I only give in when I get the need
I'm only coming around 'cause I get to leave

If you miss me, don't

If I never wanna see you again, I won't
If you get an invitation, I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation

Can't read, I can't see
Thinking 'bout the mess that you're in
Some things I couldn't see
What about the rest of you?
Well you're under my skin
But I can't let you in
Though you don't see scars
That's exactly what they are baby

Na na na na na na na na

radio,girlicious,"I was wondering if I could
Take you off somewhere
Me and you alone
Doing things we probably not supposed to (to)
I wanna get close to (you)

And I'll grab the both of your hand
Put them 'round my waist
We'll start slow dancing
While the disc jockey's playing our song
I'll give it to all night long, ooh yeah

I'll let down my hair
Take off all my clothes
Up and down the stairs
'Til we end up on the floor
It's just me, you, and the radio
Me, you, and the radio

If you touch me there
I might lose control
I hope you ain't scared
To let your body go
It's just me, you, and the radio
Me, you, and the radio

Just give me an instrumental
A sexy beat that makes me move
And I'm gon' be on you
I hope you're ready
'Cause this feeling is strong
And you know that it turns me on

I'll let down my hair
Take off all my clothes
Up and down the stairs
'Til we end up on the floor

I'ma take my clothes off
We gon' break it on down
Me, you, and the R-A-D-I-O
I know
That you're ready for me
I'm gon' jump on it
You just gotta keep it steady

And when my jam hit
I'm gon' have a damn fit
I'm gon' do the damn thing
I hope you can handle it
Got a couple candles lit
Couple bottles of that Trón
Promise I won't do you wrong
When that D.J play my song
It's gon' be on

I'll let down my hair
Take off all my clothes
Up and down the stairs (all my clothes)

rainy days and mondays,carpenters,"Talkin' to myself and feelin' old
Sometimes I'd like to quit, nothin' ever seems to fit

Hangin' around
Nothin' to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down

What I've got, they used to call the blues
Nothin' is really wrong, feelin' like I don't belong

Walkin' around
Some kind of lonely clown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down

Funny, but it seems I always wind up here with you
Nice to know somebody loves me
Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me (the one who loves me)
What I feel has come and gone before

No need to talk it out (talk it out)
We know what it's all about
Hangin' around (hangin' around)

raise hell,brandi carlile,"I've been down with a broken heart
Since the day I learned to speak
The devil gave me a crooked start
When he gave me crooked feet
But Gabriel done came to me
And kissed me in my sleep
And I'll be singing like an angel
Until I'm six feet deep
I found myself an omen and I tattooed on a sign
I set my mind a wandering and I walk a broken line
You have a mind to keep me quiet
And although you can try
Better men have hit their knees
And bigger men have died
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on, now, ring that bell
It came upon a lightning strike
And eyes of bright clear blue
I took that tie from around my neck
And gave my heart to you
I sent my love across the sea
And though I didn't cry
That voice will haunt my every dream
Until the day I die
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, oh, raise hell
Go on, now, ring that bell
(Ooh)
I dug a hole inside my heart
To put you in your grave
At this point it was you and me
And mama didn't raise no slave
You took my face in both your hands
And looked me in the eye
And I went down with such a force
That in your grave I lie
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one's telling
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on, now, ring that bell
Go on, now, ring that bell
Go on, now, ring that bell
Go on, now, ring that bell"

To be who I thought you wanted

And if it's all a lie
The truth's not far behind
We could try
To live right for the moment

It's less than what I felt

Have nothing to fear from?

rape,pharoahe monch,"(Woman screaming)

I'm obsessed with multiple nude photographs of the beat in my room on the wall
Pondering the verse, fondling my balls
Witness a nigga who will take rap and chase it
Through an occupied dimly lit staircase and rape it
Grab the drums by the waistline (scratches)
I snatch the kick, kick the snare, and sodomize the bassline
Never waste time, I give the verse rabies
Cum on the chorus, tell the hook to swallow my babies
Maybe I might... switch! Let the witch live
The original plan was to kill the bitch on the bridge
Ditch the body parts off somewhere near the cresendo
When my innuendos elapse... my nezuenno attacks
The instrumental elapses,
Perhaps that's the only reason that I spared her life
You could solo my fuckin' vocals and I still get trife
Slice the rhythm... disfigure the face of the groove
For any fader that flies or knobs or button that moves

Consider this: the loops are similar to clitorises exposed
On your miss is a hole, a vicious cycle of SIN!
That doesn't end til' I stop fuckin'
A million emcees and they ain't sayin' nuttin'

Ain't fuckin it right, they ain't fuckin' it right
They ain't fuckin' it right, they ain't fuckin' it right
They ain't fuckin' it like... ME.

(Scratches)

She had the nerve to take the case to court
Knowin' I rape for sport
Took the stand cryin' denying her whole involvement, lying
Why would an ex-cop lie in a sex shop, fly linen down grinnin'
With my coat over my shoulder sittin'
Browsin' pornography (uhh!),
The stenographer smilin' the whole time
While jotting verbal photography
Her eyes mahogany
I flashed to a photo in my mind of a body bludgeoned with slashed arteries
Pardon me, back to the case, slap in the face
Examinin' the jury similar to cracking a safe
What happens to bass? It was anistic, I would inhale eighths
Sniff that, sat her ass all over my face and taste it
To hell wit' 1980 remixes, fuck disco
Turned on the 3000, stuck my dick where the disc go
Yokonaz, ripped the sexy MPC 60, buyin' a ticket to hell
Verbally dickin' the 12 down, sound shitty
I knew she used to be pretty
Too many impotent emcees in this God forsaken city

Ain't fuckin her right, ain't fuckin' her right
Ain't fuckin' her like... ME.

Consider this: the loops are similar to clitorises exposed
On your miss is a hole, a vicious cycle of SIN!
That doesn't end til' I stop fuckin'
A million emcees and they ain't sayin' nuttin'

Ain't fuckin it right, they ain't fuckin' it right
They ain't fuckin' it right, they ain't fuckin' it right
They ain't fuckin' it right, they ain't fuckin' it right
They ain't fuckin' it like... ME."

Falling down for quite some time

Falling down for quite some time

Oh, my friends

Lost myself just thinking about the two of us
From each other drinking
Begin with the lips, fingertip and kissing
Turn me inside out, I do my best for you

Yeah, yeah, aw, mm, mm

Up and down we go, from the top you push me
This is such a thrill
Lost in love and dancing, shake your tambourine
You blow my head open
Of one thing I'm sure, that I do my best for you, I do
Ow, for you I would crawl through the darkest dungeon
Climb a castle wall
If you're my Rapunzel, you let your hair down
Right in through the window
Good they locked the door, 'cause I do my best for you

Yeah, aw, aw, mm

I think the world of you
All my heart I do
Blood through my veins for you
You alone have all of me
I give my world to you
To you I will be true

Oo, ah

Too good to be real
The smell of something cooking, my soul up to steal
Of more food we're filling
What you've given me
For it there's no measure
Of one thing I know, 'cause I give my best for you

I think the world of you
With all of my heart I do
'Cause the blood in my veins for you
You alone have all of me
From you my strength is so full
To carry your burdens too
I give my world to you

Oo, oh

Ha, hip lock up so tight, you drive me crazy
Crazy is all right with you looking at me
You make me feel high
Every single thing you do to me is like I'm drunk
I do my best for you, I do

Giving me, giving me shivers, oh, oh"

We are lovers true and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone
To satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need
Real love
I'm searching for some real love
It's always in my heart
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Oh when I met you I just knew
That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration
Lead me towards a real love
Real love
I'm searching for some real love
It's always in my heart
Real love
I'm searching for some real love
Oh, baby
I thought that love was you
I thought you were the answer
To the questions in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe I'll find a
Real love
I'm looking for some real love
Oh oh oh Real love
I gotta have some real love
So I try my best and pray to God
He'd send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me
Towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all and all
And give you good lovin' through the summertime
Winter, spring and fall
Real love
I'm searching for some real love
Oh oh oh
Real love
I gotta have some real love
You see I'm searching for a real love
And I don't know where to go
I've been around the world and high and low
And still will never know
How it feels to have a real love
Cuz it seems there's none around
I gotta end it in this way
Because seems he can't be found

But I forget
That you thank God and pray
Some things just never stay
And we all just slip away

The shadows come but no one seems to care

But blood is pain

Somewhere I know that I'm not all alone
With this bated breath I hold
My lungs want to explode

red queen,cire,"A moment to pause and rest my oversized,
overpriced head.
I'm gazing at the edges of our geometric nests
against a backdrop of atmosphere, and squinting to blur it all clear.
Realizing that there's no distinction,
I see the red queen winking at me and laughing,
because I thought I was ahead, but the world is a treadmill.

At the core of our minds we risk all to leave a piece of us behind.

(chorus)
We're still standing so we're still winning,
but every parasite that kills its host, kills itself.

red right hand,nick cave,"Take a little walk to the edge of town
And go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge
Past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms
Tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
It took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole
Heal your shrinking soul
But there won't be a single thing
That you can do
He's a god, he's a man
He's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
Through this disappearing land

But hidden in his coat

Is a red right hand

You don't have no money?
He'll get you some
You don't have no car?
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect
You feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy
'Cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio

And the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands

Stacks of green paper in his
Red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
He ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head
On the TV screen
And hey buddy, I'm warning
You to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god
He's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
In his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
His red right hand"
redeemed,big daddy weave,"Seems like all I could see was the struggle
Haunted by ghosts that lived in my past
Bound up in shackles of all my failures
Wondering how long is this gonna last
Then You look at this prisoner and say to me son
Stop fighting a fight it's already been won

I am redeemed, You set me free
So I'll shake off these heavy chains
Wipe away every stain, now I'm not who I used to be
I am redeemed, I'm redeemed

All my life I have been called unworthy
Named by the voice of my shame and regret
But when I hear You whisper, Child lift up your head
I remember, oh God, You're not done with me yet

I am redeemed, You set me free
So I'll shake off these heavy chains
Wipe away every stain, now I'm not who I used to be

Because I don't have to be the old man inside of me
'Cause his day is long dead and gone
Because I've got a new name, a new life, I'm not the same
And a hope that will carry me home

I am redeemed, You set me free
So I'll shake off these heavy chains
Wipe away every stain, 'cause I'm not who I used to be

I am redeemed, You set me free
So I'll shake off these heavy chains
Wipe away every stain, yeah, I'm not who I used to be
Oh, God, I'm not who I used to be
Jesus, I'm not who I used to be

he's not afraid to die...

The highest ledge of the worlds highest window
The first lap is finished but the race isn't run
It's only just begun

Where will we run to?
Where will we hide?
Where will we rest our heads tonight?
Where is the party?
And who will be there?
Angels or devils, we don't care

regrets,ben folds five,"I thought about sitting on the floor in second grade
I couldn't keep the pace
I thought i was the only one moving in slow motion
While the other kids knew something i did not
But if i acted like a clown
I thought it'd get me through, it did
But that don't work no more
You're not a kid no more
I thought i'd do some travelling
Never did

Regrets, regrets

I thought about the hours wasted
Watching t.v., drinking beer
I thought about the things i thought about
Until immobilized with fear
And all the great ideas i had
And how we just made fun
Of those who had the guts to try and fail
And then i ended up in jail

Regrets, regrets

...but just for a day
Seems the police had make a computer mistake
Said there must be thousands like me with the
Same name
Anyway, i thought about the things i settled for
Or never tried
I never visited my grandma even once
When she was sick before she died
So i don't blame you if you never come to see me
Here again

Regrets, regrets"

Regret
Loneliness...

Visions of love and hate
A collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter
Echoes of silent cries

I wish I didn't know now that
I never knew then...
Flashback
Memories punish me once again
Sometimes I remember all the pain
That I have seen
Sometimes I wonder what might
Have been...

Visions of love and hate
A collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter
Echoes of silent cries

And sometimes I despair
At who I've become
I have to come to terms
With what I've done

The bittersweet taste of fate
We can't outrun the past
Destined to find an answer
A strength I never lost
I know there is a way
My future is not set
For the tide has turned
But still I never learned to live
Without regret"

She unbuckled my belt, pulled back her hair
And sat in front of me on the bed

She said, ""Honey, how's that feel
Do you want me to go slow?""

And down to the road below

I felt my stomach tighten
As the sun bloodied the sky
And sliced through hotel blinds
I closed my eyes

Sunlight on the Amatitlan
Sunlight streaming through your hair
In the Valle de dos Rios
The smell of mock orange filled the air

We rode with the vaqueros
Down into cool rivers of green
I was sure the work and the smile coming out 'neath your hat
Was all I'll ever need

Somehow all you ever need's
Never quite enough you know
You and I, Maria, we learned it's so

She slipped me out of her mouth
""You're ready"", she said
She took off her bra and panties
Wet her fingers, slipped it inside her
And crawled over me on the bed

She bought me another whiskey
Said, ""Here's to the best you ever had""
We laughed and made a toast
It wasn't the best I ever had

Yeah, yeah well I kind of sort of knew what was going to happen when
She put her number down on a restaurant napkin
She said goodbye I think the words were when you're back in
Town let's have each other again
I'll come around and see you again

Like Jessica Rabbit
She corrects bad habits gets her drinks for free
Animated vixen
Stole Cupid's arrow and came to rescue me
In the blink of an eyelid
My lid opened up and I could see
That she'd come to rescue me

I tasted southern sin with a girl who was just perfection
Had a two room condo back in a wealthy section
Of the Florida flatlands where
She had me kept in a wicked trance for a day
Yeah, yeah well I kind of sort of knew what was going to happen when
She and a friend came and met me in Atlanta
I professed my love in an animalistic manner
Like an endless foreign flick
My subtitles were sick

Like Jessica Rabbit
She corrects bad habits gets her drinks for free
Animated vixen
Stole Cupid's arrow and came to rescue me
In the blink of an eyelid
My lid opened up and I could see
That she'd come to rescue me

Yeah, yeah well I kind of sort of saw the sirens coming
She was running toward me wearing almost nothing
And my heart beat skipped when she bent down at the hip
And her lips pressed against mine

Like Jessica Rabbit
She corrects bad habits gets her drinks for free
Animated vixen
Stole Cupid's arrow and came to rescue me
In the blink of an eyelid
My lid opened up and I could see
That she'd come to rescue me

She'd come to rescue
She'd come to rescue me

Here she comes to rescue me
I'm not gonna blink cause I wanna see
I wanna see her come
Here she comes
Here she comes"
resignation,face to face,"You can't be right
You're full of prejudice and spite
You think you've got me pegged but you're wrong
Out of my way
There is a consequence to pay
You think you've got me pegged but you're wrong

I am someone who'll burn the whole world down
I'm the one to bring it right around

You're giving up on me
But what else have you got

You're losing sight
I won't give up without a fight
You think you've got me pegged but you're wrong
I'm not afraid
I'll take the chance I have to take
You think you've got me pegged but you're wrong

You can't expect the world to bend to you
You only feed the fire of anger and our disbelief

I can't be everything to everyone
And I can't be everything you think that I should be"
respectable,don mclean,"Ah, it ain't so easy is it? You almost lost your place
And perhaps you're wondering how
You're going to cope with your disgrace
Well your wealth is well established and your friends were never few
And all the things they told you of you're finding to be true
Well if truth can free the guilty while the innocent must die
Then I respect, respect, respect the coldest lie

And you talk of human justice while you drive on fancy wheels
And you push them to their limit just to see how nice it feels
Well it doesn't really matter if she's living or she's dead
You just drive away forgetting that your bumper's dipped in red
Well if that's the kind of justice that our hall of justice claims
Then I respect, respect, respect old Jesse James

And most cordially they caught you and they asked you to obey
And they threw you into prison, just in case you could not pay
Well King Arthur jousted Lancelot, who stole away his wife
And your lawyers jousted with the court to save your precious life
Well if living is what matters though you lie with every breath
Then I respect, respect, the ones we put to death

And you won your case most easily and soon you will be free
But there will be a million more who lose their liberty
Not because of what they did, but what they did not do
They did not pay a lawyer or a judge to see them through
Why, they had no friends to call on
And they could not raise their bail
Well if winning is what matters, I respect the ones who fail"
restless,alison krauss,"Honey I know, you've been alone some
Why don't you fool some, 'cause I love you
And honey I know, I've been away some
I've had to pay some, and you have too

But the one thing I know that when I, I turn out the light
Visions of you dear, dance in the night. I've been
Put down, pushed around, apprehended and led downtown and I
Can't help it if I'm out of sight, 'cause I'm restless tonight

I just can't stand bein' alone
Gonna have to change that someday
There's a restless feeling in my bones, and I know
That at times, it just won't go away

So if it's all the same honey
Can't take the blame baby
Can't play a game honey
'Cause true is true

And if in the end, the temptation wears you thin, honey I'll
I'll just pretend that I leave it up to you

But the one thing I know that when I, I turn out the light
Visions of you dear, dance in the night. I've been
Put down, pushed around, apprehended and led downtown,and I
Can't help it if I'm full of fight, 'cause I

The one thing I know that when I, I turn out the light
Visions of you dear, dance in the night, I've been
Put down pushed around,apprehended and led downtown and I
Can't help it if I'm out of sight, 'cause I'm restless tonight"

And found poor Billie Joe)

Ah, a little head cold, that's all ya have
You fix it right up with a jar of Vicks salve
It's first time ever that the family been together
It's so nice that we all get along so well

To do somethin' for his mama before she died
Now, I don't mean to criticize your cookin', no I don't
But I think that you could add a little bit of pepper

I told you my mama didn't raise no fool
I can do anything if I got the right tool

Mama, make Willie quit bitin' at me!
Mama, ouch! Ouch! Mama, just make Willie quit it!

Why yes, I guess

Doesn't Sally look tacky in her silly little dress?

Go off to Memphis by herself)

Some digital delay had obscured
And it secured phased my view
Of the wicked hand you played

Run out, ah you better face it
Ah, this thing's run amok, this luck
I do know how to replace it with revenge
Oh, sweet revenge

I gave you a wristwatch, baby
You wouldn't even give me the time of day
You want to know what makes me tick

For the ghosts of our love have dried, have died
There's no use faking it
Ah, the spirits gonna close in on you tonight
High time, I was taking my revenge
Sweet revenge

All the gold and silver
Couldn't measure up my love for you, it's so immaterial

Yea, Yea, Yea
(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one

My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap, I'm loco
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm
(Your music usually has them)
(But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't)
(Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan)
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts are entertaining
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small
It says ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with white walls
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to Die Hard
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card

Hip hop ain't dying on my watch

But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got,
Don't care, don't have two shits to give

Let me take you by the hand to promise land
And threaten everyone, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

(What's your name?) Marshall

(Who's your daddy?) I don't know him, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Ha-ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)

No! If he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad
I'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and
Makes you want to get up and start
Dancing, even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens, to be rapping, blue lights flashing
Laughing all the way to the bank, lamping in my K-Mart mansion
I'm in the style department with a
Pile in my car, ripping the aisle apart
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content
Completely, despondent and condescending, the king of nonsense
And controversy is on a,
Beat killing spree, your honor, I must, plea, guilty
Cause I sparked a, revolution, rebel without a cause
Who caused the evolution of rap to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(Hip hop is the devil's music) Is that me? It belongs to me?

Cause I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, cause it's the...

It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And this time, give it to you easy, when I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands, and torture everyone, that is my plan

My job here isn't done,
Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

(What's your name?) Shady
(Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)

So, yeah, dad let's walk, let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block
Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm always so bananas, I appeal to all those walks
Of like, whoever had strife,
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
Cause I, related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle, cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles, yeah, uh-oh
Better beware knuckleheads, the sound of my hustle says don't knock
The doors broken, it won't lock,
It might just fly open, get cold cocked
You critics come pay me a visit,
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite,
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house to kick rocks
Then you wonder why I lash out,
Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
So spread the word cause I'm promoting my passion til I'm passed out
A completely brain dead Rainman, going a bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas,
I'm angrier than all eight of the reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryna look for a fucking reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a CRIMINAL
Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my GENITALS
The last Mathers LP that went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go EMERALD
When will the madness end, how can it when
There's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to sing
Is: Dad, I'm back at it again, bitch"

And Every time I think about
what might have been
I jump in my car

But I'm coming out this club with some twins, my dear
And we headed to the club where we can smoke right here
Got the girls, got the Henny, got the coke right here
Now she calling me her baby like I'm in a high chair
I swear, I fear not a thing right here

I kick rhymes all the time, I get high all the time
Can't nobody stop the vibe that I'm feeling right here
Bitch, dimes on the grind, you can't cop it for the nine
Can't nobody stop the tribe and how we living right here
And we rolling, we rolling, we smoke and blow
Ain't nobody stop the vibe that I'm feeling right here
And we rolling, we rolling, we smoke and blow
Can't nobody stop the tribe and how we living right here

How you feel about me caressing your breasts? Lesson after lesson
Like an adolescent that constantly getting in trouble
That bad ass need a whooping, whoopie cushion belt pushing
With the wolve in his nature, group huddles?
The kush is in the jar and the blunts are in the car
Blow Indian Indica cause like Jafar we be who we are
And we do what we does cause we does what we do
Spark the weed, Pikachu, pizza, booze, we can chew
And drink the same time and think the same mind

Mental telepathy, leprosy, letting C, running through
My legs and feet, walking what we preach
We don't gotta teach, just put one in the air, my dear
I swear, it's hundred percent everything right here

And we rolling, we rolling, we smoke and blow
And can't nobody stop the vibe that I'm feeling right here
And we rolling, we rolling, we smoke and blow
Can't nobody stop the tribe and how we living right here
And we rolling, we rolling, we smoke and blow
Ain't nobody stop the vibe that I'm feeling right here
And we rolling, we rolling, we smoke and blow
Can't nobody stop the tribe and how we living right here

I kick rhymes all the time, I get high all the time
Can't nobody stop the vibe that I'm feeling right here
Bitch, dimes on the grind, you can't cop it for the nine
Can't nobody stop the tribe and how we living right here
And we rolling, we rolling, we smoke and blow
Ain't nobody stop the vibe that I'm feeling right here

right now,naked aggression,"So much war, so much destruction, lives are wasted for production
So much anger, so much hate, if things don't change the human race will end

Will the 90's be another decade of apathy? Are you just going
sit by and watch things get worse and worse? NO!

The rich will stop at nothing to control the world and keep their power
They all live like royalty at the expese of you and me

RIGHT NOW in this new world order, RIGHT NOW no one is free
RIGHT NOW Corporations own this world
RIGHT NOW we are victems of thier greed

Buying off the govt. Destroying the enviroment.
Making sure there's not enough, so they can keep the prices up.
There's food rotting away in warehouses while people starve to death.
Big business won't give it to these peopel to save their lives.
because they won't make a profit! AAAAAHHHHH!

Every country must obey what these corporations say.
If they choose not to comply, troops will be sent there and they will die.

Are you prepared, do you have what it takes?
To ovelook your selfishness and create a better place.
First we must destroy the system!
If things don't change, the human race will end!"

Across the deep blue sea
I've been working, time over
Never shoulda let a woman take ahold of me
Gimme, gimme, ring my bell tonight
Baby, ring my bell
She gets her water from the rich man and gives her loving to the poor
And when she's taken to the times man
A headstart for the door

riptide,robert palmer,"Live was as calm as a summer sea
When silver moonlight beams
And then a new love beckoned me
Wrecking the ship of my dreams

Riptide caught in a riptide, torn between two loves
The old and the new
Riptide lost in a riptide
Where will it take me what shall I do?
My heart is tossed on a sea of emotion
One love offers romance
The other devotion
A new love is calling
The old love is pleading
I'm caught in a riptide what shall I do?

There's something about a day like this that
Makes me want to raise my fist and say
Let's rise and shine
It's time to face the world

If I died tonight, I'mma keep living through words I've used
Standing out in the rain singing the curbside blues
See I'm a street smart rapper with a nerd's IQ
Just staring down at the world giving my bird's eye view
This life's short so I'm taking it one day a time
Then I relive it through the stories that I say in my rhymes
Stay in my grind
And I'm praying to find
A way to design the colors that display in my mind onto the song's canvas
I'm trying to write out all my wrong answers
And beat the odds cause they say that I ain't have strong chances
Success always starts with a dream but
The closer that it gets it's like the farther it seems
Growing up I never cared about the stars on the screen
And never fell for the marketing schemes targeting teens
I'm a free spirit, experienced life and breathe lyrics
My momma taught her son to be fearless
And I'm laid back because the west is my home
I got these bill collectors calling me and texting my phone
I left them alone, decided they were stressing my dome
I knew it all when i was younger and so much less when I'm grown alone
A lost angel in the city of dreams
It ain't as pretty as it seems on the video screens
It's hideous things, but still I got the sun in my face, running in place
But we gonna make it one of these days because

There's something about a day like this that
Makes me want to raise my fist and say
Let's rise and shine
It's time to face the world
There's something about a day like this that
Makes me want to raise my fist and say
Let's rise and shine
It's time to face the world

Tomorrow is not what it used to be
And although forgotten, the youth I see walk in my shoes
Opportunity knock and soon to be lost when obstacles move in between
If all I got is the shoes on my feet
I refuse to be part of the cycle
And although my parents won't view it as me
Truth is I see more of them features creeping through as we speak
Trying to grow as an artist and a man
When your life is in the music and it all begins to blend
It's a give and take, of all the more I can
That's always been a part that's so hard to understand
I know some day, I want to be a dad
But the thought of fatherhood makes you got to get a grasp on your life
And any problems that you had
Can't wander when the kid is there, walking in your path
Trying to find some peace in myself
And at the same time maybe reach someone else
At the least I can speak what I felt
In the moment knowing that I leave nothing held back
If I was blessed with a second turn
I search for what direction works and step with purpose
Wouldn't stress against a worry
Being less I hurry I guess it's a lesson learned

There's something about a day like this that
Makes me want to raise my fist and say
Let's rise and shine
It's time to face the world
There's something about a day like this that
Makes me want to raise my fist and say
Let's rise and shine
It's time to face the world

Sometimes we gotta fight
So don't you complain
Cause I never promised this
Would be easy babe

You and me are gonna rise up
And they will be surprised, yep

And every things weird
But soon they'll be gone
Cause are whispered words
Are louder then bombs
So don't you lose faith
Say its no fun
Cause we've come to far to stop
Before we're done

You and me are gonna rise up
And they will be surprised, yep
You and me are gonna rise up
And they will be surprised, yep

Sometimes we get lost
But soon we'll be found
This is far to important
To turn back now

You and me are gonna rise up

You and me are gonna rise up
And they will be surprised, yep

rise,american music club,"The things you love don't give us too much hope
When you've lost your appetite and you're sick and tired
Maybe what you need is some food for your eyes
To make them rise

Don't tell me how to tell the truth
You're like a store that only sells guns and knives
Tell me how to make something beautiful
Flash before your eyes
Let them make you rise

It only costs a buck for three tries
Though money never buys enough of anything
And I'm a moving target trying to shake some lead
From your eyes
Let them make you rise"
rite of spring,angels & airwaves,"I was locked all day in the summer heat
In a small brown house in suburban streets
The skateboard and my shit guitar
I dream all day that they would get me far

My dad would ask me about my grades
The asshole sports that I never played
And then I'd ask about the girls he'd date
Behind our backs when mom would stay up late

It was near when I turned sixteen
Got kicked out of school and so it seemed
That things were closing in and ready to blow
My dad moved out about that year or so

It took an hour to start a punk rock band
To offset my fucked up family land
And as I held my mom would start to cry
I swore ourselves a better life.

If I had a chance for another try...
I wouldn't change a thing...
This made me all of who I am inside...
And if I could thank God

That I am here and that I am alive...
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie...
The whole wide world is mine...

The summer's gone, the years have passed
My friends have changed, a few did last
The smallest dreams got pushed aside
The largest ones, that changed my life

And all I've wished for has come to pass
From rock'n'roll to love and cash
It's all success if it's what you need
Do what you like and do it honestly

If I had a chance for another try...
I wouldn't change a thing...
This made me all of who I am inside...
And if I could thank God

That I am here and that I am alive...
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie...
The whole wide world is mine...

Yo, oh, oh-oh

Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping, no longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive?

Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Becoming one with our ritual

Singing songs of the old days
Try to remember what's gone by
Stronger in new ways, don't care what they say
This is your life, it's time to rejoice

Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Becoming one with our ritual

Our destiny is what we learned
Together wanting something more
Their misery and demons burn
A feeling that's worth fighting for

Rise up and celebrate your life

Sing for what you feel inside
Becoming one with our ritual
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside

Forgets its gentle ambling
Becoming heat, becoming steam
Becoming luminescent glee
Atoms splinter, sparkling
Alive and nimble symmetry
And all along, this glistening
Blankets we and everything
Shadows dance triumphantly
A wordless whisper sighs and pleas
Little deaths envelope thee
You and I and a flame make three
You and I and a flame make three
You and I and a flame make three

And you are not glassy bay to me
And you are not glassy bay to me
Though my tired fleet abides in your gentle breeze
And you are now vast and open sea
And my mind travels you endlessly
And you beckon, toss and toss and swallow me

And once this spark met kindling
Forgets its gentle ambling
Becoming heat, becoming steam
Becoming luminescent glee

roadkill,pulp,"The feel of my arm around your waist, the pale blue nightdress that you wore.
Your hair in braids, your sailor top: the things I don't see anymore.
You lost your suitcase in my hotel room, a subway token from your Ma.
The sun reflecting off the water on your face & the way you drove your car.
All these things I can't forget tho' I don't see you anymore.

Drove to the airport thru' a traffic jam; a deer lay dying in the road.
Maybe I should have seen it as some kind of sign, except I don't believe in them no more.
No, no - but I believe these things I can't forget, tho' I don't see you anymore.
Yes, I believe these things I can't forget, 'cos I see them - tho' I don't see you anymore."

Gonna drive past the Stop & Shop
With the radio on

I'm in love with the modern world
Massachusetts when it's late at night
And the neon, when it's cold outside
I got the radio on
Just like the Road Runner
Goin' around the highway

I walked by the Stop & Shop
Then I drove by the Stop & Shop
I liked that much better than walking by the Stop & Shop
'Cause I had the radio on

I felt in touch with the modern world
I felt in love with the modern world
I felt in love with Mattapan and Roslindale
'Cause I had the radio on
I felt like the Road Runner
With the radio on

Now I said hello to the spirit of ol' 1956
It was patient, in the bushes, next to '57
Well, the highway was my only girlfriend, 'cause I went by so quick
And suburban trees were out there, and consequently, it smelled like heaven

Out in Route 128, by the power lines
It's so exciting there, at night
With the pine trees in the dark
It's so cold, here, in the dark
With 50,000 watts of power
We go by faster miles an hour
With the radio on

Roadrunner, roadrunner (radio on)
Goin' faster miles an hour
I'm gonna drive by the Stop & Shop
With the radio on
See, I'm in love with the modern world
Massachusetts when it's late at night

You see I have the radio on
Like the Road Runner

Got the sound of the modern loneliness when it's cold outside (radio on)
Got the sound of Massachusetts when it's blue and white (radio on)
The sound on Route 128 on the dark and lonely (radio on)

I feel alone in the cold and lonely (radio on)
I feel a-, I feel alone in the cold neon (radio on)
I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel alive, I feel a rockin' modern love (radio on)

""Rock and roll for the black people""
Hi ma.

""Well that was just wonderful"""
rock 'n' roll,die apokalyptischen reiter,"I am a rocket I am a gun
I am always on the run
I am possessed by a beautiful sickness
Rock n roll is my business

Give me money for life and action and
I bring the good vibes to your nation
I guarantee you satisfaction
I am the only real attraction

Rock n roll means soul
Rock n roll is god's tool
Rock n roll is what you need
Rock n roll is what we preach

Hide your wives - I know they can't resist
If we come to your town at next
To bring you what the gods made us for
Rock n roll the revelation

Come on baby feel the ecstasy
Don't let your body rest, make you free
We give you a new religion
The healthiest addiction"
rock me to sleep,jill sobule,"Six in the morning
Been up since three
I wish I had somebody to rock me to sleep
The sun won't be melting these snowy white sheets
Wish I had somebody to rock me to sleep
Rock me to sleep
Rock me to sleep
Wish I had somebody to rock me to sleep

The book on the bed stand
The little TV
The drink and the ashtray
Keep watch over me
The long dark shadows of the sycamore tree
Wave and keep me company
Keep me company
Company
The long dark hands of the sycamore tree

Take me in your arms and hold me
'Til I close my eyes
'Til the streetlamps die
And the traffic rumbles

Rock me to sleep
Rock me to sleep
I wish I had my mother
I wish I had my father back
I wish I had my baby
I wish I had somebody to rock me to sleep"
rock me,one direction,"Do you 'member summer '09?
Wanna go back there every night
Just can't lie, it was the best time of my life

Lying on the beach as the sun blew out
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud
Oh, my my, they could never shut us down

I used to think that I was better alone
Why did I ever wanna let you go?
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea
The words you whispered I will always believe

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

Yeah, we were together summer '09
Wanna roll back like press and rewind
You were mine, and we never said goodbye, ay-ay

I used to think that I was better alone (better alone)
Why did I ever wanna let you go? (Let you go)
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea (stared at the sea)
The words you whispered I will always believe

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

Rock on, they see the jewels is so sick, l like flu spit and flu cough
Take it off and you lost, the tough talk get tooled off
Keep the 4 iron near, keep on thinkin that it's for golf
Nickel Plate on your head, silverware's food for thought
Grammy winner the haters is like ""How could this happen?"" (how?)
On the red carpet so much they mistake me for Aladdin (wow?)
How I'm a rapper with revenue like a rock star?
If I'm near you can believe the black card is not far
""Teen Spirit"" ain't what they smellin, they yellin ""Where that Nirvana?""
The crowd is rockin 'n rollin, them swishers full of marijuana
They judgin me like your honor, your daughter's here with her mama
They tell me that I'm a charmer, more freakier than Madonna
Famous look right at me and said ""Know why i got my ligher up?""
'Cause like the throwback P. Diddy alias I'ma Puff
See how we rippin up tickets that police be writin us
Do like Michael Jackson's complexion Mr. and lighten up

They treatin me like I'm Elvis
Naked pictures she mailed
She licked on a stamp and melted
So save your rap for the rookies, 'cause there ain't no rappers here
A show you do in a club is a show we do in the ampitheatre
We packin stadiums, ladies come in I'll introduce ya
It's too packed to maneuver, crowd look like LolaPalooza
We outshinin the losers, know I ride with the Ruger
You know I'ma producer, weapon upside ya medulla
Got no time to seduce a Super Head type of seducer
Groupies tyrin to snake me, but Koopa denyin' Medusas

rocket boy,jets to brazil,"Headlights and red eyes
A warm beer between your thighs
Mess of pills, Hollywood hills
The red lights read me my rights

Going in a circle, getting tighter every turn
Think you're getting better but you're never quite sure
Say it's all ahead of you, how far can you see?
You're living on your knees

Driver, please find your feet
The light's green but you spaced the keys
You're going fast but it won't last
You're all speed and no gas

Going in a circle, never getting to the point
Burning up the atmosphere, my rocket ship boy
You say there's a finish line, you're already beat
You're living on your knees

Rocket boy, my only son
You look so sad but you're so young
You get so high, you're all alone
Rocket boy, come home

Notebook, some notes you took
A big hit with a crooked hook
Your best friend is you again
You can't win but you won't give in

Going in a circle, getting lower every time
Say it isn't hurting but I never see you smile
Asking for the doctor and calling you a priest
You're living on your knees

Rocket boy, you burn so bright
And I believe, you lie so beautifully
When you get high you're all alone
Rocket boy, come home

Dad it's me again, I hate to call
Could you come down? There's been an accident
Were you involved?
Yes, sir, no, sir, they say I was

Got home, cried alone
The video will surely show
No one knows I came this close
To being me, but I lost us both

Going in a circle and it's keeping you around
You've been here forever but you've never been found
You didn't want a witness and I didn't want to see
You living on your knees

Rocket boy
Rocket boy, come home"
rocketship,shiny toy guns,"Can we get away?
Far away
Let's leave this place

Will you come with me?
Are you down
To turn your world around

It's you and me tonight
Leave it all behind

Let's go for a ride

Say goodnight to gravity
Hold on to me

The passing stars light the way
The future's here today

It's you and me tonight
Leave it all behind

Get in my rocketship
We'll leave the light of day
Staying on the turning away

There's no tomorrow
Just today
Together we will follow
Fly away
Never mind tomorrow
Just today

(Leave it all behind)

And rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me

Rocket 'til waterfalls
Rocket 'til waterfalls
Rocket 'til water falls
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass
Baby, I'll put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be your piece of sunshine
Inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines, you and I create
Rocket 'til waterfalls

So rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep

rockin' chair,tom waits,"Well I'm sittin' right here in my rockin' chair
Running my fingers right through my hair
Fire is flicken with a yellow and gold
Makin' me quiver in the snowy cold

I got a lazy old woman
Screaming 'bout my money
Man she took every cent
And she didn't leave me any

Times were never this good
Gotta fly for food
Got no woman to spend my money
Well she blew and took all my money

So I'm sittin' right here in my rockin' chair
Running my fingers right through my hair
Spider caught the fly in his web
Do believe it he may be dead

Times were never this good
Gotta fly for food
Got no woman to spend my money
Well she blew and took all my money

So I'm sittin' and I'm sittin'
And I'm sittin' right here in my rockin chair
Watchin' my old dog loosing his hair"

Sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah,
Turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
Nobody's romancing because it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music.

Bright lights flashing to cover up your lack of soul
Many people, so many problems, so many reasons
To buy another round, drink it down
Just another night on the town
With the big man, money man, better than the other man
He got the plan with the million dollar give a damn
When nobody understands he'll become a smaller man
The bright lights keep flashing, the women keep on dancing
With the clowns, yeah, yeah, yeah
They pick me up when i'm down, yeah, yeah,
The rodeo clowns, yeah, yeah, yeah,
They pick me up when i'm down, yeah, yeah,

The disco ball spinning, all the music and the women
The shots of tequila, they'll say that they need ya,
But what they really need is just a little room to breath
Teeny bopping disco queen, she barely understands
Her dreams of bellybutton rings and other kinds of things
Symbolic of change but the thing that is strange
Is that the changes occurred, and now she's just a part of the herd, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man i thought that you heard, yeah, yeah, the changes occurred, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just a part of the herd

Lights out, shut down, late night, wet ground
You walk by look at him, but he can't look at you, yeah,
You might feel pity but he only feels the ground
You understand moods but he only knows let down
By the corner there's another one
Reaching out a hand, coming from a broken man, well,
You try to live but he's done trying
Not dead, but definitely dying
With the rest of the clowns, yeah, yeah,
With the rest of the clowns

Sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah
Turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
Nobody's romancing because it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music"

Livin' my life like a rolling stone

All that I know is life on this road
Long way from home
In this rodeo
Rodeo
Rodeo
Rodeo
Rodeo (not my home)

Another day, another night on stage
Lights go down, time to turn the page
Was this all I ever wanted to be?

600 miles, the highway calls
Another long day, now the hours get small
Riding out this rock 'n' roll rodeo

All that I know is life on this road
Long way from home
In this rodeo

All that I know

Long way from home

Spinning all around and around for a while baby

You let your clothes fall to the floor

Now I'm running and I won't stop, I don't wanna go
I think about it every day and night, I can't let go
And hey, I'm never the same

They say I'm dangerous
But I'm never alone

You want your kicks for free
You'll be a rolling stone
Got an A in attitude
Spent money on drugs to suit my mood
I guess I'm just like you
Being young is over-rated
One day I'll be old and understated
But before I'm through....
I'll run naked through the streets
Be a rolling stone
Defiance in defeat, enjoy being alone
I know that you're like me
You want your kicks for free
Be a rolling stone
When we die we'll find out other ways
For getting drunk and throwing it all away
Today is tomorrow and not yesterday
It's all in your head
So get out of your head
And now your heart kicks up a fuss

I wanna steam you open
Wanna swim your ocean
We would fly
I wanna suck your motions
Exorcise devotions
Never die
And growing you inside the star's eye
You fascinate the loops with open belt
If dreams were we
I'd be the sea
And you're some crazy fisherman
Your line's on fire
You're caught in my tide
Your sky's exspiring
You're rolling again
I wanna let you see it
Wanna truly free it
You and I
I wanna bleed your cedar
Until it gives me fever and I'm high
And knowing you, you'll ride the far side
You liberate the moon from it's hung shelf
If dreams were we, I'd take the lead
You're down on your knees
The wave is rising
A blink is all you need
Now you're inside me

And get inside

room with a view,tina dickow,"I need a room with a view
An armchair by the window
a cup of coffee and a cigarette or two
Watch the sky turn from hazy gray to black
Watch my neighbours go to work
and look exhausted and burned out when they get back
Thinking about you
Thank God for this beautiful view

I recall you took me swimming
the sea was dark and cold
You'd been there many times before
with many different girls, I'd been told
But what's a man without a past
We love him for his lies
and then we try to break him down to make it last
'til they come true
Thank God for this beautiful view

Beautiful view
You, you, you...
I still love you

The dark is falling and the city fills with lights
Cars like shining pearls on strings
moving through the emptiness of night
The wine is running to my head
I'm spellbound by the moment
can't get up, can't find the strength to go to bed
Without you
Thank God for this beautiful view

Beautiful view
You, you, you...
I still love you

I've been blind too blind to tell false from true
I've been so busy running
never stopped to think where I was running to
But I've learned my lesson from the tears I've had to cry Sometimes it helps to take your time
to sit alone and watch the world go by
Cause every day it's new
Thank God for this beautiful view
Every day it's new
Thank God for this beautiful view
Thank God for this beautiful view"
rosa,devendra banhart,"Tanto, tanto, tanto claro
E tanto gris
Que raro, raro, raro, raro
Que seja tanto assim
Sonâmbulo o um esquilo
Te faço gargalhar

Será que sou assim
Me vou sem ver o que não vi
Será que penso que
Me vou ainda fico aqui

Rubro, rubro, ouro, rimo
Desnuda o mineral
E qualquer nome lhe foi dado
Assim tá sem pensar

Pensam que na sabe nada
Que tu não pode amar
Dizem que é ver pra crer
Que é inútil explicar

Te tiram da tua calma
E tua mãe a te buscar
Sem meu lábios sem parar
Não pode tem encontrar

A ver na rosa

Estranha rosa

Índio limpo, limpo, lindo
Sangue e algodão
Montanha viva, sacra
Ferida, doce e celestial

Começa assim com tal tristeza
Termina tudo igual, tudo igual
Termina tudo igual, igual

roses,kanye west,"I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin', like, ""What kind of doctor can we fly in?""
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now, she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church for thirty five years
Things supposed to stop right here?
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""
""Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?"" But still
I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
They outside of the emergency room, room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now, she 'sleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus, my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Klaye and Aunt Jean
So many aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just ""1 Thing""
When they said that she made it, you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
'Cause with my family, we know where home is
So instead of sending flowers, we the roses
I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine, oh
I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosie goes away
'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (say)
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait, for the clouds to break

Oh oh oh oh no no, say
Tellin' you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh uh
I won't wait, no"

round here,counting crows,"Step out the front door like a ghost into the fog
Where no one notices the contrast of white on white
And in between the moon and you
The angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right

Well, I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again
Where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying
Through the door, I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

'Round here,we always stand up straight
'Round here, something radiates

Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walks along the edge
Of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus

She parks her car outside of my house
And takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

'Round here, we're carving out our names
'Round here, we all look the same
'Round here, we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
'Round here, she's slipping through my hands

Woah oh oh
Sleeping children better run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

She says it's only in my head
She says, shh, I know it's only in my head
But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says, Man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?

Then she looks up at the building
Says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something

'Round here, she's always on my mind
'Round here, hey man, got lots of time
'Round here, we're never sent to bed early
And nobody makes us wait
'Round here, we stay up very, very, very, very late
I, I can't see nothin', nothin' 'round here

You catch me if I'm fallin', you catch me if I'm fallin'
Will you catch me? 'Cause I'm fallin' down on you
I said I'm under the gun, 'round here
I'm innocent, I'm under the gun, 'round here
And I can't see nothin', nothin' 'round here"

I've been told all my life
I've been told I'm living a lie
I've been told all my life

I haven't got more than one dress
Mostly I wear it out walking to work
Who else am I?

Getting it wrong almost every time
Where else, where else am I?
Living alone in my head

Rowboat left in the rain
Drifting out on the lake
Where could my one love be?

Oh, rowboat left in the rain
Drifting by on the lake
Rescue my one love from the grief"

runaways,sage francis,"(Sage Francis)
It's time to rethink every fact that is imaginable
Survival instinct dwells in a past that is inhabitable
I happen to pull fast ones over the slow parole board
Who likes to speak to de-fanged wolves who cry sheep
Time seeps into our skin, age indicates how long we've been lost in space
I keep putting expression-less upon my face
An awful waste of human skin who waits for Autumn to begin
My fall from grace, will do me in too late
(I'm out of seasoning)
No spring chicken, summer romance novel writer could win a prize
It's Nobel, go to hell in a riding vehicle that he winterized
I change my mind more often than my undergarments
Abide abortion and other nonsense
I'm an orphan who comes from Providence
I am a sign from God! For the parentally misguided

(And I know...)
State is not an ocean, not an island, not a road
If I don't know where I come from
How do I know where to go?
It's not where you're from, not where you're at
It's where your going... and I am going home

It's not where you're from, not where you're at
It's where your going... and I am going home...

...to where? The land of the lost souls
Feeling the loneliness that really only exists in abandoned foster homes
How many images of missing kids can be fit onto a milk carton?
Framed, they're starting to look the same
Starting to say his name, and claim privileges
As if they found HIM!
The strangest little kids surrounding the circle of false friendship
Rings of fire are connected at the elbow
Cause they're tired, moms unexpectedly let go
The Velcro light component that keeps there unit cohesive
It's the music! So we give reasons to get sober
Life experiences to hum to
These kids play Red Rover? I look for weaknesses to run through
With reckless abandon, they're standin', refuse to go down
The pinballs in their machine bounce between abusive homes now
If its fight or flight, they'll just choose to throw down
Ain't nothing like beating a dead horse, riding it through a ghost town
I move with no sound... I used to think I was invisible
Til they stopped me mid-stride and said
""I think I seen a picture of you...""
Picture that, I said ""Nah I just got one of them faces
Placed next to an expiration date that changes.
I kind of look familiar, my name is on the tip of your tongue
The lost look on my face makes you play dumb.
Say something colloquial
I need to get my bearings and a feel for where I'm at
But you ain't hearin' that.
They shout ""freeze!"" I'm a tourist trapped by townies
Who put bounties on armies and all surrounding counties
Before I bounce, I hear them shout
""Someone help us out, PLEASE!""
We're all alone in the foster home
Killin' ourselves with the house keys...
Not every broken home can come equipped with a fix-it man
And it's a smelly mess once the shit hits the fan
Kids just stand in their circle jerks with there dicks in the sand
Saying ""FUCK THE WORLD"" cause they aint got no girl
But who do they think I am?
Think again, I'm not that quick to plan ahead of time
I'm two steps behind their schedule, they pretend to have read my mind
I think they just misread the lines in the palm of my hand
Cause, they're random scars caused from slap boxin' with landlords
I ran with the dogs till I realized they were all mutts
Turned bitch once the dog catcher caught up
Forced into trucks, boarded up, put to sleep in the pound
Being an orphan sucks, but I'm through with sneaking around
I see my frown posted up on street lights
And telephone poles, from what they show it seems like
I never grow old, from what they show it seems like
I never go home, and that doesn't seem right
Cause they won't let me grow...

And this is where some go
To avoid the sunrays and the noise of subways
Emerging introverted, unemployed and unshaved
I feel rewarded offering a finder's fee that I know no one will pay

One shot and the whiskey goes down, down, down

Addicted to the numb livin' in the cold

Sick of being tired and sick
Of waiting for another kind of fix
The damage is damning me down, down, down

Inner peace and tranquility inside

Breaking down the defenses of my heart

And this is my life

The stranger in my mind

I'm running away, running away from you
Though I beg you to stay, I'm running away from you

I'm running away from predictable
Miss Reliable, so methodical
Wanna be individual and original
So radical and desirable

Watch it sail across the ocean blue
So free of limitations
A vision I can only fantasize
I'm floating in a new direction
As this is my life

Make shadows of trees

Where muscles are faithful

when we were winding down

mile to the board of separation

White coat
You carry me home

And take this pinecone

Until then, we pray and suspend
The notion that these lives do never end

And all day long we talk about mercy
Lead me to water, Lord, I sure am thirsty
Down in the ditch where I nearly served you
Up in the clouds where he almost heard you

And all that we built
And all that we breathed
And all that we spilt
Or pulled up like weeds
Is piled up in back
And it burns irrevocably

We spoke up in turns
'Til the silence crept over me

And bless you
And I deeply do
No longer resolute
Oh, and I call to you

But the water got so cold
And you do lose
What you don't hold

This is an old song
These are old blues
And this is not my tune
But it's mine to use
And the seabirds
Where the fear once grew
Will flock with a fury
And they will bury
What'd come for you

And down where I darn with the milk-eyed mender
You and I, and a love so tender
Stretched on a hoop where I stitch this adage
Bless our house and its heart so savage

And all that I want
And all that I need
And all that I've got
Is scattered like seed
And all that I knew
Is moving away from me

And all that I know
Is blowing like tumbleweed

And the mealy worms
In the brine will burn
In a salty pyre
Among the fauns and ferns

And the love we hold
And the love we spurn
Will never grow cold
Only taciturn

And I'll tell you tomorrow
Oh Sadie, go on home now
And bless those who've sickened below
And bless us who have chosen so

And all that I've got
And all that I need
I tie in a knot
And I lay at your feet
And I have not forgot
But a silence crept over me

Exhume your pinecone, Sadie"

To see what I can see
Crawling on the floor to reach you
I'm a recusy
When you're far from home now
Makes it hard to believe

So how you're gonna love
How you're gonna feel
How you're gonna live your life like the dream you have is real
And if you lost your way
I will keep you safe
We'll open up all the world inside so you come alive tonight
I will keep you safe

We all fall down
We all feel down
'Cause rainy days and summer highs
The more we break the more we feel alive

How you're gonna feel
How you're gonna live your life like the dream you have is real

How you're gonna love
How you're gonna feel
How you're gonna live your life like the dream you have is real

I will keep you safe
We'll open up all the world so you come alive tonight
I will keep you safe

You're giving it all away
When you've got nothing

How many times a day
You feel like walking?
Taking a holiday from
All the shy

But I live by the river
Live by the river and
I'll die by the river

The bull by the horns, my friend
It's the only way to go

And when the story's told
We can go home

So what are we gonna do
When you've stopped crying?
What ever you're going through
It's not worth dying

Keeping away the blues
You know I'm trying
What've we got to lose
And testify

'Cause I live by the river
Live by the river and
I'll die by the river

You see me swallowing my pride
She's got me crawling on the floor

saltwater,julian lennon,"We are a rock revolving
Around a golden sun
We are a billion children
Rolled into one
So when I hear about
The hole in the sky
Saltwater wells in my eyes
We climb the highest mountain
We'll make the desert bloom
We're so ingenious
We can walk on the moon
But when I hear of how
The forests have died
Saltwater wells in my eyes
I have lived for love
But now that's not enough
For the world I love is dying
(And now I'm crying)
And time is not a friend
(No friend of mine)
As friends we're out of time
And it's slowly passing by
Right before our eyes
We light the deepest ocean
Send photographs of Mars
We're so enchanted by
How clever we are
Why should one baby
Feel so hungry she cries
Saltwater wells in my eyes
I have lived for love
But now that's not enough
For the world I love is dying
(And now I'm crying)
And time is not a friend
(No friend of mine)
As friends we're out of time
And it's slowly passing by
Right before our eyes
We are a rock revolving
Around a golden sun
We are a billion children
Rolled into one
What will I think of me
The day that I die
Saltwater wells in my eyes
Saltwater wells in my eyes"
salvation,engel,"Another battle, another lost hope
We've all been fighting for nothing
Another fire, another false score
We've all been dying for something

A world that has fallen behind
Starts to unravel mankind
Listen to me my old friend
See we will lose in the end

I feel the evil eyes closing in
A wrath that will strike you all down
I hear the last of love crying out
Salvation is fading away

I honour the brave who fight
For the rest of us
I know that you'll set things right
As I'm standing my ground

Fight, back, don't let their hate grab a hold
Of, our, love that's worth dying for

We need to find a way out of this
The fear will be broken in half
It feeds on all of us who believe
A world that someday will be free

Another battle, another lost hope
We've all been fighting for nothing

I honour the brave who fight
For the rest of us
I know that you'll set things right
As I'm standing my ground

Fight, back, don't let their hate grab a hold
Of, our, love that's worth dying for

I honour the brave who fight
For the rest of us
I know that you'll set things right
As I'm standing my ground

san francisco,alkaline trio,"Choking on the thought of leaving
Drinking to keep from sobbing
4pm, 4 dollar pints
The SFO, the time and price

With all my happiness aborted
The PA painfully starts boarding
I sink deep, 30 thousand feet
Into my window seat electric chair

And I was drinking you goodbye
A heart floats in the bay
From sour home Chicago
I hear it beating far away

And there's no telling what I'll do
If I don't return to you

Hopeful thoughts of soon returning
Can't put out my stomach burning
Plastic wings and plastic smiles
Unsalted peanuts to stretch my miles

Choking on the thought of leaving
Drinking to keep from heaving
5 PM 5 dollar pints
Hell bound Airlines, time and price

And I was drinking you goodbye

santiago,tunng,"Remember the first and last goodbye
Looking for answers to untie
We traveled the long road
And at night we dreamt that we could drive

Racing short and taking hope
We're biding our time and growing old
Encircling questions
Looking for direction and self control

Why did we go, Santiago?

Memories fade in late July
She's looking too close and feeling shy
It's taken forever
While love will have to lead us awry

Remember the first and last goodbye
A place is to grow and hide for life
We traveled the long road
It gave us sight for the price of desires

Why did we go, Santiago?"

You come and hold me
It's you and me forever

Oh, won't you smile a while for me, Sara?

But why don't you stay until tomorrow?

Chewing fingernails in her shit-eating grin

They cut out her heart when
She was a little girl
And in the fishing boat she thought
She saw the shadow of God

He never came at all
And when she died, she was going nowhere
Nowhere, nowhere

The tarmac of a melting motorway
She gave me her clothes and told me to take her place, her place

Who's gonna play with me?
Six in the morning, baby
I've got a long, long day ahead of me

The parents are sleeping soundly
The neighbors are dead as wood
I'm gettin' up and comin' over
We've gotta rock the neighborhood

Nothing's ever gonna happen 'round here
If we don't make it happen
Sleep away the day, if you want to
But I got somethin' that I gotta do

It's Saturday morning
And this ain't the place for me
I'm giving you warning, baby
We've got a whole, big, fat world to see

Nothing's ever gonna happen 'round here
If we don't make it happen
Sleep away the day, if you want to
But I got somethin' that I gotta do

It's Saturday morning

Six in the morning, baby

saturday night,mcfly,"With my parents outta town
I got all my buddies 'round
Said we're gonna have a party tonight
If your dad has got the truck
Then I'll come and pick you up
And anyone who wants to come for a ride
And if you wanna have a drink
There's some bottles by the sink
Over 20, 000 people inside

You know that everybody likes to party
On a Saturday night

We've got every girl in school
In the deep end of the pool
If you wanna take a dip bring your trunks
When we start to dim the lights
Gotta find a girl you like
And you better hope she's already drunk
And if somebody's feeling sick
Get them in the garden quick
'Cause we don't want them to spoil all the fun

You know that everybody wants to party
On a Saturday night

We're waking everyone asleep
When we start the party in the street
We want the neighbors to complain
'Cause the music's driving them insane

And if it's goin' to your head
Get behind the garden shed
It's where everybody goes to get laid
Or if you want another beer
Then there's plenty in the rear
No one here to check, if you're underage
And if you think you're having fun
Then the party's just begun
Anyone who leaves will wish that they stayed

You know that everybody likes to Party
On a Saturday night

We're waking everyone asleep
When we start the party in the street
We want the neighbors to complain
'Cause our music's driving them insane

When my parents come back home
I'll say we've been alone
But we don't know how the mess got this bad
I'll be grounded for a while
All I have to do is smile
And I'll get a little talk from my dad
And the next time they're away
All my buddies can stay
We'll do our best to drive the neighborhood mad

You know that everybody likes to party on a Saturday
Everybody wants to party on a Saturday
Everybody loves to party on a Saturday night"
saturday's gone,isobel campbell,"If we're good ? for dusty highways and such
Be alright to look her up
The faded priestess of the highways and crutch
Calling when you're down on luck
By the disused railroad road station you go
To the house of dirty pearl
Her existential situation you know
She is not like other girls
She may ask you, ""Do you believe?""
You can't stay, though you'll never leave
See the sapphire in the skylines so blue
See the diamond in the dirt
When you think the subject won't turn to you
She got demons up her skirt
Isn't sure of her reflection at all
Is seduced by all things past
A pleasure-seeker of dejection
Gazing into her looking glass
She may ask you what you believe
But the mirror doesn't see me
Saturday's gone
Saturday's gone
Saturday's gone
Saturday's gone
She may ask you, Ã¢??Do you believe?Ã¢??
You can't stay, though you'll never leave
Saturday's gone
Saturday's gone
Saturday's gone
Saturday's gone
Now a sundown comes, a new day for her
Tired of dress and ??
You'd be a fool to ask her to lift you up
Why go up when we go down?
You should tire of ties that bind you
Film of fever leaves so fast
You've got trouble far behind you
Well knows nothings' made to last
See how God hears a lion roar
Watch the serpent crossing the floor
Saturday's gone
Saturday's gone"

Though the motions I've been going through have failed
And I'm coasting on potential towards a wall
At a hundred miles an hour

Two more weeks
My foot is in the door, yeah
I can't sleep
In the wake of Saturday (Saturday)

With promise and precision and mess of youthful innocence
And I read about the afterlife
But I never really lived more than an hour (more than an hour)

Different in our hearts filled with

Let the narrow-minded sleep we better do some action
Across the universe you smell the smell of lies

Repeat bridge / See them run they know no fun
And look what they have done
In this world full of rules

I can't seem to find my way

You've been saved... this time
You've been saved... this time
You've been saved... this time
This time

If there's a way, I think you've lost it
Turned and fell and lost your ground
If you make it through you'll want me back
I'll be needing you, next time

You've been saved... this time
You've been saved... this time
You've been saved... this time
This time"
save,the rocket summer,"I'm not feeling touch
I'm not making that much
And I guess I am blessed
But sometimes it's just hard to see it as such

I'm stuck and alone in the traffic lines...
While couples in love in the HOV fly by
I don't get it, I'm not asking for much
But everybody wants to just have something

So I'll be picking me up,
Breaking me down,
I was lost, was I found.
I want to feel everything
When everything feels wrong with me
Take a look, and brace myself
Everybody wants to make it count

Save me
'Cause I could never float, sinking
Amaze me
And I would be there holding on for life

Sitting again
Sitting inside this drab apartment
The walls are blank,
It's like they're talking to me.
I put a picture on the wall
I took a chance, I took a fall
She took off fast and gracefully,
Yes I was blind and now I see.

And I was picking me up,
Breaking me down,
I was lost, was I found.
I want to feel everything
When everything feels wrong
Take a look, and brace myself
Everybody wants to make it count

Save me
'Cause I could never float, sinking
Amaze me
And I would be there holding on for life

And I could tell
From the picture I could feel
I was sinking.
Pull me out, bring me back to life
The colors that my eyes had never seen,
Well I can see it now

Save me
'Cause I could never float, sinking
Amaze me
And I would be there holding on for life

Save me
'Cause I could never float, sinking
Amaze me
And I would be there holding on for life

So save me
Save me
Save me
Save me"
saving grace,rumer,"I was running out of cafe conversation
I was weary of fashion parade
And it seems like there's a whole lot of people
From out of town 'round here these days
And in the streets, the preachers say
""If you wanna go to Heaven, why don't you walk this way?""
All day I prayed for 5 o' clock
I'm thinking maybe I should quit this job
And as the lights turn on the corner, I see your face
And I light up like a child
'Cause you are the one who makes me see
You are my saving grace
You make me want to make me want to become
Become better
'Cause when you walked in, you truly changed my world
When you take my hand, you make me strong
And when I'm weary, I don't have to explain myself
When I crawl the stairs, you let me rest
I never thought I'd ever see the sun again
Bitterness was beating down my door
Now I'm picking up the telephone, I read your name
And I light up like a child
'Cause you are the one who makes me see
You are my saving grace
You make me want to make me want to become
Become better
'Cause when you walked in, you truly changed my world
When you take my hand, you make me strong
And when you want me, I'll be there, you know I will
Just take my hand and I'll make you strong"
saviour,memento,"And we've tried so hard
To erase you
And we've tried so hard
To pretend you were dead

I walked the earth
Just to escape you
And now, I walk the earth
Just to touch you again

Come on down
My saviour, my failure
Come on down
My saviour, my failure

To save myself, I betrayed you
And these swollen lips
Whisper only for revenge

To spite myself, I became you
If I stop the lies
Will I see you in the end?

Come on down
My saviour, my failure
Come on down
My saviour, my failure

No don't let go, no, no, no
No don't let go

Oh, swimming through the red
With nothing up ahead
I cannot buy a friend
I came here to tell you
I miss you, I miss you

Come on down

Come on down

We broke up a month ago
And I grew up, I didn't know
I'd be around the morning after

It's always been wait and see
A happy day and then you pay
And feel like shit the morning after
But now I feel changed around
And instead of falling down
I'm standing up the morning after

Situations get fucked up
And turned around sooner or later
And I could be another fool
Or an exception to the rule
You tell me the morning after

Crooked spin can't come to rest
I'm damaged bad at best
She'll decide what she wants
I'll probably be the last to know
No one says until it shows, see how it is
They want you or they don't

scarborough fair,carly simon,"Are you going to Scarborough Fair:
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
Remember me to one who lives there.
She once was a true love of mine.

On the side of a hill in the deep forest green.
Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested brown.
Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call.

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt:
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
Without no seams nor needle work,
Then she'll be a true love of mine.

On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves.
Washes the grave with silvery tears.

A soldier cleans and polishes a gun.
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call.

Tell her to find me an acre of land:
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
Between the salt water and the sea strand,
Then she'll be a true love of mine.

War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions.
General order their soldiers to kill.
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten.

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather:
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
And gather it all in a bunch of heather,
Then she'll be a true love of mine."

scars,blackfield,"Thousand miles away I see the light of day
A day that knows no tomorrow
Distant memories are buried in the past
They only bring me pain and sorrow

A story not yet told
Facing a wall of silence

The scars I have inside of me never leaving me alone
Forcing me to be on my own trusting no one but myself
I'm trapped in a barren reality where nothing ever stays the same
Trusting you was my last mistake but the scars they will remain

Many years have past and the soul never last
Tearing a hole in my heart
Falling down through life I'll never be the same
Sleeping while my mind rips apart

See myself living a lie inside a castle of treachery
The future's wide open for me but I walk down a dead end street
Feeling the demons arise my body is numb from the unspeakable fear
But still I cannot face the real me"

Ask you to stay
Would that scar upon your lip

Cause I don't want to have to let you go

Let this part of me
Remember how lovely we are, we are

If you saw in my mind
How I felt
You would hold me tight
And ask nothing else

I want you but I hate to say those words
But here I am

Standing right in front of you
Asking for a hand
Cause I don't want to have to let you go

Let this part of me
Remember how lovely we were, we were, we were, we were

So scream, a Halloween serenade
Illusions shattered, wait 'till you're really afraid
You're gonna, ah-ah

Run and hide (please) from my embrace
In the night (ah), I love a chase
Tell me no, (tease) before we kiss
Nice and slow (ah), I live for this

Should I let you remember? I can't resist
Gonna haunt you forever

You scream, but there's nobody to hear, it doesn't matter
It's only you and me and all of your fears
So scream, a Halloween serenade
Illusions shattered, wait 'till you're really afraid
You're gonna, ah-ah

Underneath the setting sun, something wicked your way comes
Who am I? Just a dream
Sent to take you, shake you, make you scream

Try to see (deep) behind my eyes
Destiny (ah), won't be denied
Don't you know? (Sweet), you're what I need
Flesh and bone (ah), you're gonna bleed

Should I let you awaken? I can't resist
Look around you, you're forsaken

You scream, but there's nobody to hear, it doesn't matter
It's only you and me and all of your fears
So scream, a Halloween serenade
Illusions shattered, wait 'till you're really afraid
You're gonna, ah-ah

You scream, but there's nobody to hear, it doesn't matter

sea breezes,roxy music,"I've been thinking now for a long time
How to go my own separate way
It's a shame to think about yesterday
It's a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame

We've been running round in our present state
Hoping help will come from above
But even angels there make the same mistakes
In love, in love, in love, in love

Now that we are lonely
Life seems to get hard
Alone, what a world lonely
Alone, it makes me cry

Thought-train set in motion
Wheels in and around
Express our emotion
Tracks up then it cracks down, down, down, down

Now that we are lonely
Life seems to get hard
Alone, what a world lonely
Alone, it makes me cry
I cry, I cry, I cry

We've been running round in our present state
Hoping help will come from above
But even angels there make the same mistakes
In love, in love, in love, in love"

sea song,craig armstrong,"The time has come
For me to leave this place
The light, the sound of the cars
Have made me broken
If you could change your mind
If you could change your mind
Going back to the sea
Your skin and the sky light
Are fading to the distance
The soul of the light I must have
Echoes through the building
If you would call my name
If you would call my name
Going back to the sea
If you would change your mind
If you would change your mind
I'm going back to the sea"
searchin',stephen simmonds,"The truth has just been compromised and left the deeds undone
I know that I'm not there, but I've begun
The humble man must sacrifice with love for everyone
Patiently prepares his heart is one I wanna feel the love so I go

Searchin', been lookin', everywhere now I need someone to guide me deep within
Seachin' but after all these years, still undiscovered inside me they won't win

As I await my unborn fate, I trust the insecure
But no matter what I give, they all want more

they all awake, but always late, possessions keep the score,
I look for love, but now my eyes are sore, I wanna feel the love so I go

All the wisdom you possess, where is the love you wear to hide your inside like a dress
You never were sincere,

All the time I gave you, I guess
I lived to learn, now I'm letting all the fake inside me burn, so I amâ"
searching,change,"Hit the town in the cold of the night

Warmth of the light

You can make this your home
If you want to

It was brighter inside
Someone come and asked me my name
Taken back by surprise
What I saw with my eyes
A girl in a love's disguise

She said stop! stop! stop!
Get out your heart
Haven't got a lot
But play the part
Mister stop! stop! stop!

What I've got's hot stuff
The night is ours
Coffee glass that had
Fell from my hand
Like a child couldn't
Quite understand
What was I doin there
Far away from nowhere
On my own
I was tired and awake for some time
Just the light playing
Tricks with my mind
Was she there in a crowd
Was the music too loud
Was I dreaming
Searchin, Searchin (For so long)
Searchin (I dont want
Romance I just want my
Chance searchin)
Searchin, Searchin (Yeah)
Searchin
Just came by here by chance
Only wanted to dance,
No news, no her, no, no, no one
Taken back by surprise
What's in front of my eyes
This girl in a love's disguise

seattle,the classic crime,"My real estate
My life is dull
And dried up like the sound
A voice makes when the heart grows cold
And it's going that way

I think I'll move out of state
Somewhere far from Seattle city lights
They burn my eyes
California sounds nice but California's a lie
Maybe I'm out of luck
Or maybe I'm just blind
All this time

Rain on my hopes
Rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous
The pursuit of this dream
We thought we'd be there long ago

My life is like a rolling river
So muddy and absurd
And although I might be mistaken
I know that I'll be heard
And I find the second I try to pull away
I'm thrown back in line
All this time

So
Rain on my hopes
Rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous
The pursuit of this dream
We thought we'd be there long ago

Rain on my hopes
Rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous
The pursuit of this dream
We thought we'd be there long ago

And we are all looking for the same thing
The same thing

Seattle is calling me back home
Back home

So
Rain on my hopes
Rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous
The pursuit of this dream
We thought we'd be there long ago

Rain on my hopes
Rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous
The pursuit of this dream
We thought we'd be there long ago"
second best,barenaked ladies,"Everything's a lie
We're all gonna die
Before we say goodbye, let's attack

I admit it's bleak
But I give it a week
Until our friends the meek give it back

Is it true? Well it's true enough I guess
Join the chorus of the second best

Second best (several times)

What's left of you that's real
A mutated ideal
With limited appeal, I suggest

If winning is an art
Then it's drawn us apart
When you erased your heart and beat your chest

Is it you? Well it's you enough I guess
You're an angel in a see-through dress
Is it true, yes it's true enough I guess

Second best (Several times)

Perhaps it's just as well
That I still look like hell
At least the world can tell us apart

Is it true? Yes it's true enough I guess
Come join the chorus of the unimpressed
Is it true, yes it's true enough I guess
Sometimes it's better to be second best

Second best (several times)"
secrets,alice smith,"The morning after
The only laughter
Echoes from the night before
I'm feeling broken
Words already spoken
Lay crumpled
And hurt on the floor

Except for those
That I should not have said
Guarded secrets
Locked inside my head
Oh, what did I tell
Precious gems entrusted to me
Those were struggling to be free
Uncontrolled
From my mouth they fell

Oh, secrets, some mine
Some his, some hers, secrets

The truth's so easy
'Cause i'm so lazy
It comes so naturally
Oops, I told him
Just where you've been
Perhaps
I should not have told him

Please in future don't burden me
With your lies and your secrecy
I deal with my own
Because from my mouth they fell
I have trouble
Keeping things on the DL
When they're not seeds
That I've sown

Oh, secrets, some mine
Some his, some hers, secrets
Oh, secrets, some mine
Some his, some hers

Thought I'd keep it
Underneath my hat
But temptation won me over
Just like that
Thank you not
For the extra guilt I got
When you said what you said
I'm just a child
Wild and free
I need the time
To take care of me
Take the time to care
For number one so

Please in future don't burden me
With your lies and your secrecy
I deal with my own
Because from my mouth they fell
I have trouble
Keeping things on the DL
When they're the seeds

To live and not to die

Then I could see a little light
I could find some peace of mind
I don't know where you are
Maybe near or maybe far
I just need a little light

Hear a clock ticking on a life that could have meaning
If I could find the love light in your eyes
See a million people
Everyone's so lonely
But we don't have to be alone tonight

serenade,arab strap,"And I'd serenade you every night
But you'd never be home to hear it.
I wrote your name with fireworks in the sky
But you never turned up to see it.

So let me take you out and buy you drinks
And I can mumble through an explanation.
I hear you know that's when you're getting old,
When all you really want's a conversation.

Don't get me wrong, I've always had plans
For your lips and my lips.
The first time I saw you I saw all my future
Right between your hips.

You're a woman who can teach me stuff.
The kind of girl I want to bathe and dance with.
But just ignore me now I understand;
I only go for girls i've got no chance with.

Look up right now, the sky's on fire.
I want your breath when I retire.
I want your feet to scratch my shin,
To make me bleed and scar the skin."

I can feel the fire, crawling on you like you're superman
But I would pay to watch you burn

All the love you have disintegrates
No one saved you but your apathy
I can see the knives hung on the wall
All the blood stained dreams I can't recall come

Take back this pain you gave
All the love you have disintegrates
All that saved you was your apathy
I remember all the knives you hung
And all the bodies stretched across the wall
All the drama that they made me think
Couldn't be real, must be fake
I can see the bodies on the wall
All the nightmare dreams I can't recall come"

In a prison yard at night

In the attic of a house
In the slats of light which creep across the room
In a forest grove at dawn
Where the animals sleep hidden in the gloom

On the 97th floor overlooking Tokyo
In Camden road in a second floor flat with
Dilworth down below
There is only one thing
There is only one thing

In a cancer ward where the patients sit
Waiting patiently to die
In an aeroplane high above the place
You finally left behind

In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I
In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I

In every single place that has ever, ever been
Hiroshima, Los Angeles and each town in between
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
One thing

In the darkest part of you that you have ever seen
In the smile of the child staring at the TV screen
In the diary of a priest, in the sheets that lie upon his bed
Out there amongst the waves and inside your lover's head

There is only one thing, there is only one thing
There is only one thing, there is only one thing
There is only one thing, there is only one thing
There is only one thing

20 years asleep before we sleep forever
20 years asleep before we sleep forever
10 years on the coast figuring out the weather
Another decade getting high until you're free
There's nothing after that but you and I
Nothing after that but you and me
20 years asleep before we sleep forever
20 years asleep before we sleep forever"
seven days,azure ray,"Seven Days of low worth
Keep me hovering above the ground
The nights just blend into the morning
Definition is the first to go down

If I were to stay here between us
I might forget where I'm bound
So I can't stay in between us
Guess I'll walk away

I'm here to read the future
But forced to breathe out the past
And too many conversations
To uncover what was purposefully lost

I know we all look so desperate
Showing the guidance that we lack
And we used to be so wistful
I guess we feel it's safer holding back

If I were to stay here between us
I might forget where I'm bound
So I can't stay in between us
Guess I'll walk away"
seven years,norah jones,"Spinning, laughing, dancing to her favorite song
A little girl with nothing wrong is all alone

Eyes wide open
Always hoping for the sun
And she'll sing her song to anyone
That comes along

Fragile as a leaf in Autumn
Just fallin' to the ground
Without a sound

Crooked little smile on her face
Tells a tale of grace
That's all her own

Fragile as a leaf in Autumn
Just fallin' to the ground
Without a sound

Spinning, laughing, dancing to her favorite song
She's a little girl with nothing wrong
And she's all alone
A little girl with nothing wrong
And she's all alone"

I've been to the doc, he's got the means
He's turned me into a Sex Machine
He's given me a pair of enormous balls
That could even fill the Festival Hall
With schoolgirls *screaming* for more and more
(*sometimes creaming or even squeaming*)

(Chorus:)
I'm going to the doctor's
It's easy you see
No need for operations
And you'll know how it feels

Tomorrow I get my hands done
With fifteen fingers and a phallic thumb
I'll rattle the girls till they come and come
The stomach lining change has really done the trick
It brews alcohol and give me kicks
And makes me have supersonic sicks

(Chorus)

I've got pricks on my toes and one on my nose
And some on my back that nobody knows
And the one I got first still grows and grows
I've got a set of clits hanging in my ear
I went to the doc to get a smear
He told me I had gonorrhoea

I nuclear prick is hidden up my bum
I tried it on a lady who likes some fun
And she got blown to kingdom come

Instead I chose to take a fall,

And I've me to blame

Left with all my shame

Shouting in my head,
Things that were bright yellow,
Are now black instead

I had a secret meeting with a strange desire,
I couldn't get enough it only took me higher,
Now I see

I didn't realize they had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,

It's not replaced with dust,
And your fingerprints are gone,
And now loneliness is a friend of mine

The girl's too young
She don't need any better
It's all coming back
I can feel it
The girl's too young
She don't know any better
It's all coming back
I can feel it
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
The girl is beautiful
You're giving me moves that hit from all sides
And when you are hitting like that you melt my eyes
The girl's too young
She don't need any better
It's all coming back
I can feel it
The girl's too young
She don't know any better
It's all coming back
I can feel it
And though I never know you
I look at your face
To tell you that I love you
Don't know what to say
You're everything I got, you beautiful girl
The only thing I live for in the whole wide world
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
The girl is beautiful
I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
Going to throw it away
And talk to you
She looks good
She looks good
And it's true
And it's true
The girl is beautiful
She is beautiful
I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
Only living one time
And I want you

she is love,parachute,"I've been beaten down
I've been kicked around
But she takes it all for me
And I lost my faith
In my darkest days
But she makes me want to believe

They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need
She's all I need

Well I had my ways
They were all in vain
And she waited patiently
It was all the same
All my pride and shame
But she put me on my feet

They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need
She is love, and she is all I need
She is love, and she is all I need"
she moves through the fair,fairport convention,"My young love said to me
My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you
For your lack of kind
Then she stepped away from me
And this she did say
""It will not be long love,
Till our wedding day"".
She stepped away from me
And she moved through the fair
And fondly I watched her
Moved here and move there
Then she made her way homeward
With one star awake
As the swan in the evening
Moves over the lake

I dreamt it last night
That my dead love came in
So softly she moved
That her feet made no din
Then she came close beside me
And this she did say
""It will not be long love,
Till our wedding day""."
she said,the pharcyde,"I guess everybody needs somebody to love
You can't leave love lonely
'Cause being naive to it, you can just lose it like that
See kisses for bruises don't make it heal back
It be the sex appeal that's from the next and, not necessarily the sex and-
One might appeal to the intellect having a greater affect on how they feelin'
Stimulation breaking down their shields for the real and-
As it stands mysteriously, curiosity it kills the cat and-
Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in, behind
These fantasies with no action searching for a remedy
Now she loves her man but there is just a different type of chemistry
That flairs when her desire's on fire
Quick is the fuse, another loves for hire

And she said
""It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight""
So I granted her wish

And she said
""It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight""
So I granted her wish

I was high like the vocal tone of my nigga Bootie Brown
Decided to take a ride to see what's really going down
Up on the North side of town
Of course I brought the quarter pound
Of bomb hemp, feeling alright like Johnny Kemp
On a Friday night
Looking right 'cause my shit is tight
Blazing blunts to city lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights
Bounce to the House of Blues then I slid in free
With tennis shoes, sweatshirt, jeans, and no ID
Soon as I step inside the plizace, I recognize the fizace
Of an epp with an iz-ass more amazing than grace
So waste no time to kick my line
I say, ""How ya doing?"" She say, ""Hey, I'm doin' fine""
So I commence to macking to baby to see what's cracking

So maybe I get her back at the cabin and start attacking
Threw back a shot of yack and started jabbering
Jibbing, fibbin', and ad libbing just to get her to my crib then

We was chilling on the bed, bumping some Isley
Thought I was about to spread the thighs but she surprised me
When she said, ""Oh like that? You know I don't get down""
I know my homies gonna clown 'cause I let her stick around when-

When she said
""It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight""
So I granted her wish

Now Daddy's home
But she's been waitin' all night so we could be all alone
This is an everyday thing so we hang out by the phone
Trying to build something real, working fingertips to the bone
Too much love's gone astray that it won't be coming home
No time soon
So I dance with the silhouettes beneath the moon

And she said, if satisfaction's guaranteed
Nothing else could come between the flight of a new love baby, yeah
Maybe we could be cool
Instead of sharing this here ship with the fools
You know that, right now, right now, right now, baby
Right now, right now, right now, baby
And she said
I'll give you the world if you want it
I'll give you the world if you need it baby
You got to have it
And she said
You know that she said (Let's make love)
And she said
And she said (I'm loving you)
And she said (Come make sweet love to me)
And she said (I wanna make sweet love to you)
And she said (Get it on, get it on)
I'll give you the world if you want it (I wanna make sweet love to you)
I'll give you the world if you need it baby
I'll give you the world if you want it (What you wanna do)"
she's gone,tindersticks,"She's gone
And it's quiet now
Took her mother with her
Left town
Took her mother's eye
Stole her mother's heart
It's a compromise

We nurture that part and she's gone
Says she can walk now
Says she can walk now
Thinks she can walk
Seen her walking
She totters and falls
And when I'm not looking
Leans onto the wall
And she'll hold on to me only when she wants
And she'll fall and be up again
It's part of the fun
But she's gone
Thinks she can walk now
Thinks she can walk now
Thinks she can walk

She's gone
And it's quiet now
Took her mother with her
Left town
Took her mother's eye
Stole her mother's heart
It's a compromise

We nurture that part and she's gone
And it's quiet now
Took her mother with her
Left town"
she's my baby,mazzy star,"She's my baby
She belongs to me
But yesterday she walked home all alone
Everybody else
Looks at my baby
Then they want to know her name

But baby's feelin' bad today
She said she's thinkin' of goin' away
Oh, baby, I'm cryin'
And my body's flyin'
But I remember you

She's my baby
Ain't that something?
But I know she belongs to you

Yesterday was another day
When I saw your baby
Walkin' home alone

I'm feelin' sorry
I called you but I guess that I forgot your name
But baby's feelin' bad today
She said she's thinkin' of goin' away

But she's just like lightning
She goes right through you
Then you know you'll never
Be the same

Now everybody looks
All around the corner
Just to see your baby
Walkin' home

She's my baby
Ain't that something?
But I know that she belongs to you
She belongs to you"
she's not me,madonna,"I should've seen the sign, way back then
When she told me that you were her best friend
And now she's rolling, rolling, rolling
And you were stolen, stolen, stolen
She started dressing like me and talking like me
It freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night
What's that about?

I just wanna be there
When you discover
You wake up in the morning
Next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast
And love you in the shower
The flavour of the moment
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (it won't be the same)

I should've seen the sign when you were here
Under a different light, it's all so clear
She was stealing, stealing, stealing
And now you're feeling, feeling, feeling
She started dying her hair and wearing the same perfume as me
She started reading my books and stealing my looks and lingerie

I just wanna be there
When you discover
You wake up in the morning
Next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast
And love you in the shower
The thrill is momentary
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (it won't be the same)

She is licking her lips
And she's batting her eyes
She's not me
She's got legs up to there
And such beautiful hair
She's not me
Oh, devoted for life
Make a beautiful wife
She's not me
If you spend some more time
I guarantee you will find
She's not me
(I know I can do it better)

If someone wants to pimp your style
And hang with you a little while
And make up for the things you lack
You're gonna have to watch

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (it won't be the same)

(Never let you forget)

She's not me
She's not me and she never will be

(Never let you forget)

She's not me
She's not me and she never will be

Gotta funny way to show your feelings
I guess it was some bullshit, saying, ""You love me, love me""
Guess my expectation hit the ceiling, uh
When you come back, it could cost, just trust me, trust me
Wanna be

She's not me, she's not me
She's not me and she never will be
She's not me, she's not me
She's not me and she never will be (she never will be)
Never will be, never will be, never will be
Never will be, never will be

Never will be, never will be, never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
She's not me and she never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be

She's not me, never will be, never will be

She's not me and she never will be (she never will be)"
she's the one,caribou,"Call her thief
Call her shallow and insincere

'Cause you'll never see just how perfect she could be

Then she's gone and my friends can come along
And they tell me that I'm happier
One more fight, yeah, you tell me all the time
How do I swallow my pride?

But she's the one
She's the one
But she's the one
She's the one

Time and time I hear things that can't be true

And it's only talk 'cause she'll never be so cruel

Every night there's a new name on her arm
That I don't think I recognize
And it's never strange just how long she stays away
I guess I'll have to compromise

Though she's the one
She's the one
But she's the one
She's the one

Though she's the one (she's the one)
She's the one (she's the one)

she,elvis costello,"She
May be the face I can't forget
A trace of pleasure or regret
May be my treasure or the price I have to pay

She may be the song that summer sings
May be the chill that autumn brings
May be a hundred different things
Within the measure of a day

She
May be the beauty or the beast
May be the famine or the feast
May turn each day into a heaven or a hell
She may be the mirror of my dreams
A smile reflected in a stream
She may not be what she may seem
Inside her shell

She who always seems so happy in a crowd
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud
No one's allowed to see them when they cry
She may be the love that cannot hope to last
May come to me from shadows of the past
That I remember till the day I die

She
May be the reason I survive
The why and wherefore I'm alive
The one I'll care for through the rough and rainy years
Me I'll take her laughter and her tears
And make them all my souvenirs
For where she goes I've got to be
The meaning of my life is
She, she, she"

Nah they. they clean.
I mean. what?
You wanna look at the bottom of...?

My shoes are clean girl, how about yours?
Here we are sitting on your living room floor
Listening to some records from your collection
Boredom; in between a coma and an erection
Staring at the skin on your shoulder blades
And you don't take your eyes off my poker face
I'm wasted, and your as sober as Jehovah
Knocking door to door, trying to walk to road
That the Mormon's paved
If she was here on your sofa with a beer on a coaster
She'd of told 'ya that my game was way over played
Make no mistake
I love the way you taste like yogurt and some clover cigarettes
Girl show me leg!
So I'ma gonna trade these shoes for rollerskates
And I'ma stay happy just as long as there is a whore to pay
But some of us already spent the rent
So we can't be content until there isn't no more today

(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Those are your shoes
These are my shoes
We've got issues

My shoes are muddy girl, how about yours?
Here we are loungin' on your bedroom floor
I'm really drunk so I'm looking at your carpet like
Man, fuck the permit, I know where I'ma park tonight
It's closing time, the spins are gonna visit me
They're rolling thick like they know they taking victory
But not tonight, right, I'ma make some history
Get up in your system and direct it like a symphony
Let me get to be the man of your mystery
'Cause them meddeling kids don't understand your sensitivity
Show some sympathy
Let me kiss your feet
Let's talk about a pretty bird and a busy bee
If I live to see fifty, I'ma be a tipsy, dirty old man
Still following my kid beliefs
I know it isn't really your responsibility
So we'll be strait once I take a hit of Listerine

(Chorus)

I can't find my shoes girl, how about yours?
Here I am naked on your bathroom floor
I got faded, and you fell asleep
And I'm thanking God that this date was hella cheap
Sitting down, trying to keep the liquor down
Light, stars and sounds everything flickers now
Sick bound, the whole room twists around
In front of the toilet assume the position to drown
Here it comes! Whiskey out bounces all over the floor
Now I'm sitting in the bitches mound
I'm just a clown and I'm sorry I found it funny
When you tripped over my shoes and hit the ground
Didn't know you would rip your gown
Didn't think you would shout and get so loud, get so wound
Yeah I'm drunk, but I'm more than a little proud
I'm leaving, fuck the shoes you keep them, I'm getting out

Yo, it's time to bring the day in, fresh out the crib sauteein
Around the way-in, swerve on, surveyin
That's when I saw her, the kind you wanna see more of
The sexy aura, it made it hard to ignore her
Expression her posession of property skyrocket
I'm investin in her presence and in time it profits
I take a acre for you, fertilize the soil
And make it boil, til it produce black oil
The Shorty sweet as, the flavor of forty divas
Photos and features, worth more than Mona Lisa's
It's lady lucious, tender touches my blood rushes
Smiles and blushes, on billboards and buses
And me, I'm just a bronze skinned calm gentleman
Slim fit and open arms mellow wit a Don's grin
Ghetto disciplined, could be your confidant beyond friend
It's one of Allah's men, Rakim, show me love

Promise you won't do me wrong (uh)
If I turn you on (go ahead, uh)
Promise you'll stay all night long (uh, yeah)
Makin love til dawn (turn me on love)
Promise you won't do me wrong (mmm)
If I turn you on (mmm, mmm, yeah)
Promise you'll stay all night long
So we can get it on (check it out)

I'm in effect mode, I keep the ep sewed
When you express your finesse to your dress code
Every step's a pose, you've been blessed and it shows
My interest grows, the effervesce explodes
Because this chick's, characteristics, mystic
Hips are thick, just a little bit of lipstick
Can't resist it, description Egyptian smile
Queen of the Nile, that means she dipped in style
She re-mind of Nefretiti, yes indeed-y
But it's hard to get it like hieroglyphic graffiti
Studied her exhibits and checked her colorful curves
Intellect with swerves I coulda wrecked my nerves
That's my word, diggin her enigma that exist
In a sister, carefully wrapped in her figure
We connect like a collision and hug, just to knowledge
Her wisdom, speed up my metabolism, show me love

Promise you won't do me wrong
If I turn you on (uh, yeah)
Promise you'll stay all night long (YEAH)
Makin love til dawn (check it out)
Promise you won't do me wrong (go ahead, go ahead)
If I turn you on (yeah, yeah)
Promise you'll stay all night long
So we can get it on

Your M.O. is hard not to notice, so my motives
Is to stay focused, body moves like aerobics
Attractions, vibes I caught came from your ways
And actions but mindframe hard to explain
No actin or mindgames, but thinkin of what can happen
Is migraines, the x-rated though remains
We relaxin, and you naggin me for the agony
To your anatomy, by the fractions
Your measurements, the pleasure's in every inch of your temple
I travel twenty-three million miles of your mental
Chemistry, between you and me, in harmony
Causin angles to meet, like trigonometry
Or pyramids, that's where your deepest, treasures are hid
Then it gets, odiferous, cause I know where it is
I mastered that, cause it's easy when you react
The all-natural aphrodisiac, show me love

Promise you won't do me wrong
If I turn you on (yeah)
Promise you'll stay all night long (go ahead, go ahead)
Making love til dawn (uh)
Promise you won't do me wrong (straight up)
If I turn you on (go ahead, uh)
Promise you'll stay all night long (yeah)
So we can get it on (show me love)
Promise you won't do me wrong
If I turn you on
Promise you'll stay all night long
Making love til dawn
Promise you won't do me wrong (uh, yeah)
If I turn you on (check it out, uh)
Promise you'll stay all night long (and you don't stop)
So we can get it on (uh)
Promise you won't do me wrong
If I turn you on
Promise you'll stay all night long
Making love til dawn"

Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong
Got this little song for you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious

Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in the Louboutins
What you want, what you need

Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down

Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—

All just happen when you pass my way
What can I do to make you stay?
I know it's getting late, but girl I don't want you to leave
You tell me you're just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I'm not trying to say I don't believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it's worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won't forget me
You'll be happy that you let me

Lay you down, down, down

Shut the fuck up! x2

On your right side there was
Nothing left, and on the left side
There was nothing right
Your head's bigger than your cowboy hat
I'll pick your teeth with my baseball-bat
A slingshot and a band grenade
You trying target
Practise in the dark
You only brag about your dirty deeds
But your storm's not coming

And we all know what to do
Wrong bit

sick,chelsea wolfe,"This suffering brings me closer to you
And time is broken and moves slow
Your pure heart, your white light
I should be put to death for ever being cruel to you
You washed me clean like no one ever could
Come closer now and step right into
The wide mouth, the sharp teeth of the one you love
I'm not the kind of sick that you can fix
Don't you worry about me baby
I've got no enemies and i've got no time
The song, we carry on
Even though you pushed us down
We carry on
When you try to blind my eyes i can see tenfold
It's nothing that my heart can't take, 'cause your hate has made me strong
And stronger men than you have tried to break me
Stronger men than you have tried to break me
Leaning toward the golden days
Forget about the older days
And everything we left behind
To stand here in another life
We carry on, even though you held us down
We carry on, with the song
We carry on, even though you pushed us down
We carry on"

signals,verse,"So here's a story about a city with a secret
Everyone one here is the life of the party
And everyone who's anyone is everyone's biggest fan.
If they've got what you need.
Everyone whispers and sends out a secret nod
The congregation's in 5 minutes
""Meet me in the bathroom."" Or maybe tonight the lines
Will get drawn right in front of you.
The life you live is a life of stupidity
Like those on pages of a Hollywood magazine.
See the stars in your eyes and the glamor you'll never see
Because you live on your knees.
Money burns like your nose, you comfort yourself and stay in the smoke screen.
You've found true love inside an empty scene.
You live in a bad dream.
She's just searching for acceptance, and He's afraid,
But still puts himself out there.
They all came in search of a good time.
Approaching the night with closed eyes.
Pull the shades down, to hide the beautiful person you are on the inside.
Your photocopied reflection: distorting your actual size.
You live in a bad dream."

The fire you have lit inside of me

And wonder where you might be
They look up without realizing
That they're standing right there in the palm of your hand

I just love You

It's common knowledge
That you've been dead for a while
It's well known that the cross is only a burden
With pains and trials
But then again how come my shoes are so light
How come I can walk for miles
And still just love You

So I think I'll stay
Caught up in a silent prayer
Cause I believe in silence
Our hearts speak the same word
So why don't we just walk along
The shoreline with our silent song
Cause I believe in Silence
Our hearts speak the same word

We have to prove
That our love is real over and over again
But let them think what they want
Cause I know it will never end
Because I know where it began
And my heart still pounds twice as fast
Whenever you walk by
Cause I still love you

So I think I'll stay
Caught up in silent prayer
Cause I believe in silence
Our hearts speak the same word

So why don't we just walk along
The shoreline with our silent song
Cause I believe in silence
Our hearts speak the same word, the same word
The same word
The same word
The same word

So I think I will stay
Caught up in a silent prayer
Cause I believe in silence

simple twist of fate,jerry garcia band,"They sat together in the park (note 1)
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate (note 2)

They walked along by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far off played (note 3)
As she was walkin' by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up, the room was bare (note 4)
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks (note 5)
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again, how long he must wait
Once more for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within (note 6)
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring
She was born in the spring, but I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate"

First B-side is freedom of speak
If you don't speak, well I ain't losin' no sleep.
See me on the cover of your Double X-L (L)
Takin' a holiday at the hotel (tel)
Fans keep sending me back the fan mail
Heavyweights keep it on th grand scale, when we doin' it.

Chorus (Crowd Cheering and Clapping)

(Pos)
Hey, yo, The sky swallowed the sun
Spitted out the moon and stars
Puttin' out shiners that gave the cause
ArmorAll-ed down, the downtown activity
I'm bout to have fun without the problems that live with me
Not tryin' to be posh, but lets stay out the mosh pit
Tonight keep my nose out of trouble
Everybody in my bubble's been breifed:
NO BEEF, JUST PARTY!
Of course your gonna have some clown niggaz try to
Take us off course
Always lower levels tryin' to bring out the devil in us
Not condoned but its known
That a party ain't a party if the thugs don't try to shut it down!
Tight security and its still soft
Can't offset the thirty or plus caught in the rush
Keep the door sealed
Cause the floor's filled with action and we don't need
Any distractions tonight ya'll.

(Dave)
Introduce me to your madaam? Mauzel?
I'm Tarzan and she's my gazelle
I live at Biggs and say its notorius
Travel through minds, emotions and euphorias
Glorius (echo) as I get great (echo)
Still kinda smooth like way back in my oldschool tapes
I bring it pronto
Rep the BX like Billy Blanco

(Crowd cheering and clapping)

(Pos)
Treat your troubles like colds
Sweat it out, get it out
So we can get in the right mode
Let it out
No need to pull on the throttle
If I could bottle this love I wouldn't hesitate
Get it straight
Wonder why I can medicate the soul
While takin' its toll
Just for Simply (Simply!) Havin'(Havin'!)
The right record that could bring in the pull
And this must be the right run ya'll
Cause the dancefloor's full CUZ!

Chorus to fade (Cheering, Clapping, Horns)"
singer,"jump, little children","The singer steps forward
He's not a tour-sung hero
He's not the embodiment of a soul brother
The unassuming troubadour
Sings to himself softly
And not a word escapes his lips
They don't even try.
His words would rather stay with him
As long as possible
But his melody is for me and for you.
I prefer to be alone when you're not around
Sometimes when I speak, I can't stand the sound
Of the voice. This great big destructive machine
That takes too much time to say what it means.
They tell me that my father is sick once again
With the plague that has decimated many old men
I settle once more into the long sad dread
That reminds me that all loved ones soon will be dead.
This is why I spend so much time making love to you
In your arms I was searching for things that were true
This is why I spend so much time making love to you
In your arms I was searching for things that were true
It's a memory of mine that I'm watching for a moment
I'm distracted just a bit by something less important
I'm here for the part of the day that I crave
I have caffeine in my system makes me feel brave
The chill in the air is exactly what I want
And with the sun on my face
And my eyes tightly shut
It's important for me to remember these things
It's important for me to remember these things
I'm pretending we're in Prague picking sodas by the square
And the clock brought the masses to the ceremony there
Every hour little puppet spun around the clock face
Each figure represents one of the human race
And somehow we were always on time for the show
We'd arrive to the chaos of the people right below
Those large chiming bells that had a song to sing
It's important for me to remember these things
Absinthe and sex; black garters; cheap wine
A hotel in Prague; a moment in time
We were hungry and scary and so much in love
We laugh with each other as we push and we shove
Absinthe and sex; black garters; cheap wine
A hotel in Prague; a moment in time
We were hungry and scary and so much in love
We laugh with each other as we push and we shove
And the singer keeps singing
And the singer keeps singing
And the singer keeps singing
Keep singing singer…
That was the first time I really caught your eye
In the small italian shop with the coffee that you liked
And when our eyes met I couldn't look away
My mouth opened to speak but there wasn't much to say
I was froze, transfixed, by the way that you looked
How you grabbed me and pulled me into a small nook
Where we kissed like we had never tasted lips before
And I still wanted more… I still want more
I'm frightened of what these words might bring
But it's important for me to remember these things
I'm frightened of what these words might bring
But it's important for me to remember these things
You're too far away for this to make sense
I feel in my heart every mile of distance
I don't want him to stop because I know what that means
The song will be over and so will you and me
The song will be over and so will you and me
The song…"

sinner,jarboe,"And what do I do
With the gift you present to me
The one no one else would buy
They would not accept the filthy premise
Of your most terrible innocence
So let them say how you were wild
For what you really were was tender
Yes how you screamed all through the night
Yet silent tears streamed down in morning light
Most beautiful my lonely sinner

So come over dear sister
Let them say how you ran wild
So come over dear sister
You gave birth to this devil child
How you screamed all through the night
In your glass cage and crimson neon light
Most beautiful my lonely sinner

So come over dear sister
Though you were born down there in the dark shack
These pearls you now wear once hung down my Duchess' back
So carefully wrapped round the precious throat
Just twisted this here shiny rope
Beautiful my lonely sinner
Most beautiful my lonely sinner
So carefully wrapped round the precious throat
And yes did she -like you- thus... choke"

Help you dress yourself up fancy
And bathe you when you get sore

Be all you would want and more and more

Be proud when you dazzle the wand'rers
Glitter your eyes for the town
Tell every last boy that you're my man

sirens of the sea,bruno coulais,"I'm known as the siren of all seven seas
The breaker of hearts by the bay
So if you go swimming with bow-legged women
I might steal your weak heart away

A big-bottomed sea witch may bob through the waves
And hope to lead sailors astray
But a true ocean goddess must fill out her bodice
To present an alluring display

Oh, beware now of old oysters too large in the chest
Let's banish them from the buffet
I'm far more nutritious

You smell like the fishes!

Did I hear a banshee?

You're sea-green with envy

This mermaid enchantress

No! I, birth of Venus

Will send sailors swimming all day"

sleepwalking,modest mouse,"Last night you know I couldn't sleep
I was tossing, turning, and counting sheep
To tell the truth
The next thing I knew
I woke up on the outside
In the middle of the avenue

A policeman spied me traffic there
In my t-shirt and my underwear
He said, son, son
It sure don't look good
The way you've been calling for your baby
All over the neighborhood

It seems I was sleepwalking
Again last night
The way I was sweet talking
It must have caused a terrible fright
Last night when I was sleepwalking

Someone saw me at a doughnut shop
I was sitting, crying on a tabletop
It was not a pretty sight
I was out of control
The way that I was carrying on
About my sweet jelly roll

I said officer please
My baby's got me down on my knees
Lying in bed
Late at night
Sometimes I just go out of my head
At night
And I go out sleepwalking

Later on down at the jail cell
I was hoping things would turn out well
Because I don't recall
That masquerade ball
And I don't remember nothing y'all
About that blown up rubber doll

So lately I've stopped going anywhere
And I've taken to sleeping with a teddy bear
It's a very full and rich
Imaginary life
And it's sure enough better than dreaming y'all
About any imaginary wife"

I feel my heartbeat slowing down
My mind's released and free to wander
As I sleep

The past buried deep inside my head
All the words that have gone unsaid
I just want to let them go

Life on a distant star
Or a boat to where the wild things are
I just want to let it flow

Deep in the night when I hear no sound
I feel my heartbeat slowing down
My mind's released and free to wander
As I sleep

If you're quiet you'll hear the sound
Bits of the world as it spins around
We feel lost and we feel found
When we sleep
When we sleep
When we sleep
Sleep

Two worlds colliding in my head
I watch you as you sleep

Two worlds colliding in my head
Two worlds colliding in my head
Two worlds
Colliding in my head"
slide,low,"They tell you come tomorrow
Nothing for you now
You listen so intently and slide
Slide, slide, slide

Hearing only yourself
You wait for the truth
How can you get it
When all you do is slide?
Slide, slide, slide"
slip away,david bowie,"Oogie waits for just another day
Drags his bones to see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers gray
Oh, they Slip Away

Once a time they nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They Slip Away
They Slip Away

Don't forget to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world and war torn
How I wonder where you are
Sailing over Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are

Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982
The joke we always knew
What'sa matter with you
C'mon, let's go
Slip Away

Don't forget to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world and war torn
How I wonder where you are
Sailing over Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are"
slippin,dmx,"Ha ha ha ha ha ha, uhh

See, to live is to suffer but to survive
Well, that's to find meaning in the suffering

Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

I been through mad different phases like Masons
To find my way and now I know that happy days are not far away
If I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids
Doing something more constructive with they time
Than bids I know because I been there now I'm in there
Sit back and look at what it took for me to get there
First came the, the drama with my mama
She got on some fly shit till I split
And said that I'ma be that seed

That doesn't need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed and a heart that doesn't bleed
I'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Baggin' when I caught a buzz
For thinking about how short I was
Going too fast it wouldn't last but yo I couldn't tell
Group homes and institutions, prepare my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcin' me to be a man
When I was just learnin' to stand without a helpin' hand

Damn, was it my fault, somethin' I did
To make a father leave his first kid at 7 doin' my first bid?
Back on the scene at 14 with a scheme
To get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be living high off the hog
And I never gave a about much but my dog
That's my only, I had offered my last
Just another little, headed nowhere fast

Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

That ain't the half get's worse as I get older
Actions become bolder heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a to touch
Didn't need a click 'coz I scared a that much
One deep went to gids startin' for kicks
Catchin' vicks throwin' bricks gettin by bein' slick
Used to get high just to get by used to have
In the morning before I get fly

I ate something a couple of forties made me hate somethin'
I did some now I'm ready to take something
3 years later showing signs of stress
Didn't keep my hair cut or give a how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side livin' the cruddy life
Like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fuckin' up
I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up

Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Wasn't long before I hit rock bottom
Like damn look how that rock got him
Open like a window no more Indo look at a video
Sayin' to myself that could've been yo nigga on the TV
Believe me it could be done somethin's got to give
It's got to change 'coz I've got a son
I've got to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more getting high drinking forties

So I get back lookin' type slick again
Fake jump back on my again
Nothin' but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my that kept it real
Be strong kept a nigga from doin' wrong
Who they is and this is yo song
And to my boo who stuck with a through
All the bullshit you'll get yours because it's due
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Can't get up, I gots to get up

So I can feel all I want to know

I'd prefer to look into your beautiful face
What a waste
And the stars continue to fly by
I don't have one desire to understand why
I don't try
Slow, slow
As slow as you can go
I want my senses to overflow
Slow, slow
And doesn't it show?
I don't need a race in my bed
When speed's in my heart and speed's in my head
Instead
It's tempting for fools to rush in
When something's so good why should we rush and fail?
It's the same
Slow, slow
Slow as you can go
That's how I like it

I don't need a race in my bed

small things,ben howard,"Oh, my mind
I walk down Mayflower Road again
The wailing sun
Echoes from the park, seems so absurd
The bus takes hours
I knew it would, but I can't shake the sting
Can't spend my time on everybody else
If buildings fell at least we'd be in matrimony
I can't control the words kaleidoscope inside my head

Has the world gone mad or is it me?
All these small things they gather 'round me, gather 'round me
Is it all so very bad? I can't see
All these small things they gather 'round me, gather 'round me

Saw the police
Screaming something trivial like, ""Keep the peace""
The world moves on and you can't shake the sound
I know she's home
Waiting on somebody loathe in light
All in my mind
The anvil and the weight upon my back

Has the world gone mad or is it me?
All these small things they gather 'round me, gather 'round me
Is it all so very bad? I can't see
All these small things they gather 'round me, gather 'round me

And I can't see, my love

Has the world gone mad or is it me?
All these small things they gather 'round me, gather 'round me
Is it all so very bad? I can't see
All these small things they gather 'round me, gather 'round me

And I can't see, my love

And I can't see, my love"
smoke and mirrors,poets of the fall,"I danced a tango with my hubris high on youth
We swept across the dance floor to subjective truth

But there was no harmony there
No reason for coexistence
Nothing to span the distance, now

Do we even know who we are
Living like all life is forfeit
Like we can just go redefine it
Regardless what we broke

Who died and made us stars
With our intellectual gambits
Our millionaire flair and our antics
We're like mirrors seen through smoke

I tried a shanty with the fool to find my pace
Anything from puns to jests to intertwine our ways

But there was no loyalty to hope
And funny the need for mercy
How it makes us bleed all mercy, now

Do we even know who we are...
Living like all life is forfeit
Like we can just go redefine it Regardless what we broke

Who died and made us stars
With our intellectual gambits
Our millionaire flair and our antics
We're like mirrors seen through smoke

Now the melody's void of sympathycos that shit's in byte size bits on YouTube

So tell me what am I supposed to do

When the malady's no remedy Till we reach the lowest absolute

And necessity will finally force something through what's walling you

Do we even know who we are...
Living like all life is forfeit
Like we can just go redefine it
Regardless what we broke

Who died and made us stars
With our intellectual gambits
Our millionaire flair and our antics
We're like mirrors seen through smoke"
smoke gets in your eyes,roxy music,"They asked me how I knew my true love was true
I of course replied
Something here inside cannot be denied

They said someday you'll find all who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride, tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes"

And let it flow, this cruelty
Of youth as you fall again, alone
In the compromise of truth

It's in the eyes
I can tell, you'll always be danger
We had it tonight
Why do you leave it open?

And the stakes
Remain too high
For this silent mind
And the shake, the lonely itch
That course down my spine
To leave a love divine
Don't leave a love divine
It's a water tight excuse

It's in the eyes
I can tell, you'll always be danger
We had it tonight
Why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes
I can tell you'll always be danger

How does the earth around your feet
Just slip away?
And the bandit that greets you in the night
With snake eyes
The most precious time

It's in the eyes
I can tell you'll always be danger
We had it tonight
Why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes
I can tell you'll always be danger"

They say its past the deadline
They say they've lost control
They let you see their nightmares
Through eyes of coal

Guilt is your own anger
You who did not win
Dream a dream of somewhere
As the rope is wearing thin

Go

Piece of mind, some kind of love, my love?

I know I'd throw it all away,
And if you go,

so close,hall & oates,"They met on the dance floor in the old high school gym

And out of the door, yes, you did

Yeah, a man loves a woman, but he can't understand
Why she's sad when she stares at the ring on her hand
Or she sits in some club where the long shadows fall
Drop a coin in the jukebox, not the phone on the wall

We're so close, so close, yet so far away

Every light has been left on
But there is no one home

So you'll go
To where the strangers roam
Hoping you'll be sit
From what you've always now

How far we're going to go?

Waves crash along
Battered lonely lighthouse
Tomorrow she's gone
And if not, someday, somehow

Are these hands a waste?

Is scaring me to death

solitary confinement,rhyme asylum,"(We the dawn of a new species, adapt or perish...)

[Verse 1: Possessed]

I'm born invincible and second to none, desolate one
Putting out lit cigarettes on my tongue
Plant my flag in Mount Doom
Put my money where my mouth is and raise my face value
Your talk is cheap, doped up on Thorazine
Spit one time for your mind like the thought police
In my prime till I die
I'll ""Dial M for Murder"" now your life's on the line
Swear by the whites of my eyes
That the imagery I'm bringing is so vivid it gives sight to the blind
Christ the divine
My brain is a smart bomb, combined with Oppenhiemer design
Mind blowing, samurai ronin
Sleep with my third eye open (scoping)
Candles are played out
On my next birthday, make a death wish then blow my brains out

[Chorus: Psiklone]

Eleven Letters never get it confused, we better than you
(Independent) Yeah the legends are true
This here, ""Solitary Confinement""
Alone in this mental asylum
Eleven Letters never get it confused, we better than you
So start spreading the news
This here, ""Solitary Confinement""
Alone in this mental asylum

[Verse 2: Psiklone]

Straight out of London - crazy motherfucker named Psiklone
From a mad clan of savage insane psychos
Nasty bastard
In your local morgue dancing with a frozen corpse just to get the party started
I don't hold microphones
Closed my eyes and told the mic to float with mind control
Exit earth climbing lightning bolts
Rappers got no backup like broken Sky remotes
Destiny's physical form
Chalk outlines for murder scenes minutes before the victims were born
Force vivid subliminal thoughts
I strangled my Siamese twin with the umbilical cord
Bury your head in desert sands
Link words that rhyme in my verse and draw webs of connecting pentagrams
Stretch imaginations on torture racks
Jump up mid-autopsy asking for my organs back

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3: Skirmish]

Let's enter inside ""Solitary Confinement""
Sentenced to life in this mental asylum
Hell spawn
We amongst the 13 ghosts between the 14th and the 12th floor
Ahead of my time an intelligent mind
That everything that I know is self taught
Without R.A no way you can spell raw
Mentally disturbed signs hanging on my cell door
Marked the game with carved initials
We perfected the art, you perfected the artificial
Impossible to restore my faith
I'm negative, forever live in war and hate
Born insane in the mind
I'm so far gone, so say your goodbyes
Best to leave now
Or pay with your life, when I bid you farewell to the flesh, you rest in peace out

[Repeat Chorus]"

Often, often

I won't forget all the things we did

someday never comes,billy valentine & the forest rangers,"First thing I remember was asking papa, ""Why?""
For there were many things I didn't kno
And Daddy always smiled, took me by the hand
Saying, ""Someday you'll understand""
Saying, ""Someday you'll understand""

Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause, someday (someday) never comes
No, no, someday (someday) never comes

Well, time and tears went by and I collected dust
For there were many things I didn't know
When Daddy went away, he said, ""Try to be a man
And, someday you'll understand""

Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause, someday (someday) you'll understand
Oh, someday (someday) you'll understand

And then, one day in April, I wasn't even there
For there were many things I didn't know
A son was born to me, Mama held his hand
Saying, ""Someday you'll understand""

Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause, someday (someday) never comes (never comes)
No, no, someday (someday) never comes

Think it was September, the year I went away
For there were many things I didn't know
And I still see him standing, trying to be a man
Saying, ""Someday you'll understand""

Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast, you better learn it young

No, no, someday (someday) never comes (never comes)

I've lost my voice - I'm still a quiet one...

Half the sunlight for a rainy day

So when it's brown I'd have some green

It's already getting better (You will never leave me)
It's already getting better (You will never leave me)
It's already getting better (You will never leave me)

Somedays I'm so close to you
That I can feel
That sweet song singing to me in my ears
Somedays I just don't want it to end
Somedays the rain comes pouring and the color fades
The music once so loud slips away
And I'm left standing all alone

It's already getting better (You will never leave me)
It's already getting better (You will never leave me)
It's already getting better (You will never leave me)

'Cause good things come easily and good things go
Feelings are these feelings I'm feeling
So I can't let the joy be depending on the sunrays

It's already getting better (You will never leave me)"

somethin' stupid,robbie williams,"I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me

And if we go some place to dance
I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me

And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid
Like: ""I love you""

I can see it in your eyes
You still despise the same old lines
You heard the night before

And though it's just a line to you
For me it's true
And never seemed so right before

I practice everyday
To find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come true

But then I think I'll wait
Until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you

The time is right
Your perfume fills my head
The stars get red
And oh, the night's so blue

And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid
Like: ""I love you""

The time is right
Your perfume fills my head
The stars get red
And oh, the night's so blue

And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid

something beautiful,great big sea,"Hey You, you lost your only friend
You can't believe you're broken heart will ever mend
But every mountain has its faces that'd make you want to stop
On this so unwelcome journey from the bottom to the top.

Move along
I believe there's Something Beautiful to see
Move along
I believe there's Something Beautiful
Just waiting for you and me

I know you'll never count the tears you've cried
Though you've asked a million questions
No one could tell you why
A single soul is chosen to be the one put to the test
But there will be some consolation for a heart that never rests

The years will make us older
The winters make us colder
And there's one more thing I've come to know for sure
There's no bitterness that smolders, no chip on any shoulder
That a random act of kindness couldn't cure

Hey You, you lost your only friend
You can't believe you're broken heart will ever mend
But every mountain has its faces that'd make you want to stop
On this so neverending journey from the bottom to the top."
something else,gary jules,"They never tell you truth is subjective
They only tell you not to lie
They never tell you there's strength in vulnerability
They only tell you not to cry

But I've been living underground,
Sleeping on the way
And finding something else to say,
Is like walking on the freeway

They never tell you you don't need to be ashamed
They only tell you to deny
So is it true that only good girls go to heaven?
They only sell you what you buy

And I've been living underground,
Sleeping on the way
And finding something else to say,
Is like walking on the freeway

I've been living underground,
Trying not to burn
And finding something else to learn,
At Hollywood and Western"
something i need,ben haenow,"I had a dream the other night
About how we only get one life
Woke me up right after two
Stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldn't lose my mind

And I had the week that came from hell
And yes, I know that you can tell
But you're like the net under the ledge
When I go flying off the edge
You go flying off as well

And if we're only here once, I wanna live with

You've got something I need
In this world full of people, there's one loving me
And if we're only live once (hey)
I wanna live with you (you, you, you)
You've got something I need
In this world full of people, there's one loving me
And if we only here once (hey)
I wanna live with you (you, you)

Last night I think I drank too much
Call it our temporary crutch
With broken words I tried to say
Honey, don't you be afraid
If we've got nothing, we got us

And if we're only here once, I wanna live with

You've got something I need
In this world full of people, there's one loving me
And if we only here once (hey)
I wanna live with you (you, you, you)

I know that we're not the same
But I'm so damn glad that we made it
To this time, this time now

You've got something I need
Yeah, in this world full of people, there's one loving me
And if we're only here once, I wanna live with you, yeah
You've got something I need
In this world full of people, there's one loving me
And if we only here once (hey)
I wanna live with you (you, you, you)

You've got something I need
In this world full of people, there's one loving me

something stupid,frank sinatra,"I know I stand in line, until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me

And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid like ""I love you""

I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you
For me it's true, it never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right your perfume fills my head
The stars get red and oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid like ""I love you""

The time is right your perfume fills my head
The stars get red and oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid like ""I love you""
I love you

sophie,benjamin francis leftwich,"Caught a bird and let it go
Had a rope and don't you know
When I pulled it down, it settled on the ground
Caught a bird and in a trap, had a lot to give back
When the sun came by you opened up your eyes

Oh brother, will you let me in again?
Oh sister, I am stumbling again
Oh Sophie, will you be my good friend?
Oh Sophie, will you be here in the end?

Then you whispered in my ear
I am lost, but you're here
As the scene unfolded, truth got moved away
Caught a bird and let it go
Had a rope and don't you know
When I pulled it down, it flew from the ground

Oh brother, will you let me in again?
Oh sister, I am stumbling again
Oh Sophie, will you be my good friend?
Oh Sophie, will you be here in the end?

Even though the scene was never golden.
All the while you're bones have gotten frozen.
You stood still

Oh brother, will you let me in again?
Oh sister, I am stumbling again
Oh Sophie, will you be my good friend?
Oh Sophie, will you be here in the end?"
sophisticated lady,jaco pastorius,"They say into your early life romance came

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want?
No, sophisticated lady,
I know, you miss the love you lost long ago
And when nobody is nigh you cry

Wrong number

She was so confused
From her point of view
I would be confused too
I'm so rude
What was I thinking?
But, but
She dug my hair and new suede shoes
So much she dragged me straight, straight to her room
And I was forgetting what I knew I would do
Two hours later we lay on the bed and I said

I'm sorry sorry for making your life a living hell
Yes I'm, I'm sorry sorry for making your life a living hell

space travel is boring,modest mouse,"Won herself a pass to some far off moon
It was second class but what's to lose?
And looking out her window she could more than assume
You can't see air or time

She's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place
They gave her a mirror so she could talk to a face
She still got plenty lonely but that's just the case
With time, time, time

Started hearing voices sometime in June
She knew she could go crazy but didn't think that soon
Now she doesn't feel lonely but she'd just as soon
Try, try, try

Man shot to the moon
I bought a paperback and want to go real soon
I'm shot to the moon
Been here a half an hour and wanna go home soon"

Space is my heaven... Woh

I can see the planets turning,
It's like something that's not true
I'm really sure I must be dreaming
'Cause I'm here from out of the blue

Understand I play the part of the stereotypical man
And regret the pain that I may have left my flame

Your charm must have calluses from the grip
That it has on my heart that I ain't tryin' to rip
But by now we both should know
That it's no longer where you at but where we tryin' to go
So do you background checks so I can pass through these borders
And stamp my name on a little man or a daughter

No one'll know where you are

Running speed trials still standing in place

When the socket's not a shock enough
You little child what makes you think you're tough
When all the people you think you're above

I scratched my head and the answers were gone

From hand to hand, wrist to the elbow
Red blood sand, could dad be God?
Crosses cross hung out, like a wet rag
Forgive you, why? You hung me out to dry

And maybe I'm crazy
But laughing out loud make the pain pass by
And maybe you're a little crazy
So laughing out loud make it all subside

Holding, I'm holding
I'm still falling, I'm still falling

Spoon in spoon, stirring my coffee
I thought of this and turned to the gate (to the gate, ah)
But on my way crack lightning and then thunder
I hid my head and the storm slipped away

Well, maybe I'm crazy
And laughing out loud make it all pass by
And maybe you're a little crazy
So laughing out loud make it all alright

Laughing out loud

Some move ahead while some lag behind
It's like the balloon that rise and then vanish
This drop of hope that falls from his eyes)

Spoon in spoon, stirring my coffee
I think of this and turn to go away
Well, as I walk their voices behind me saying
Sinners sin, come now and play

Come now and play

Come in from the cold for a while
Everything will be alright
Come in from the noise for us
Everything will be alright

Everything will be alright
From now, goodbye

And I can't believe what they're saying
They're saying I can change my mind
Start over on Spring Street
I'm welcome anytime

Well there are Spring Street storefront daisies
Floating on their neon stems
There are new shirts on the clothes racks
Should I feel like one of them
I can find a small apartment
Where a struggling artist died
And pretend because I pay the rent
I know that pain inside

Yeah, let's watch the tour bus stop and tell us
Here's the scene of a spring green life dream
Take the best part
Write it in your caffeine diary

And I can't believe what they're saying
They're saying I can leave tonight
Start over on Spring Street
I'm welcome anytime

This year April had a blizzard
Just to show she did not care
And the new dead leaves
They made the trees look like children with gray hair
But I'll push myself up through the dirt
And shake my petals free
I'm resolved to being born
And so resigned to bravery

Yeah the one who leaves this also grieves this
Too much rain on a prairie flood plain
Houses floating, love is like that
We built on the river

And that's to say, yeah I'm leaving
But I don't have to go there
I don't have to go to Spring Street
'Cause it's spring everywhere... """
springtime,annuals,"Well I never meant you harm when I laid you down
Told a story about your life as a kid
With every word I say, let one tear drop
Until it all comes clear
Just unlocks in time to hear
Springtime sing

Through every living core, there tolls a chime
It tethers life and love
And every time it rings
It's the promise that it brings you life
Absolve the rain it's drop as all who hear
Make springtime sing"
spring,the innocence mission,"Look out for spring
The life underground
The life underground

The thawing and the overflow
Oh early, early in the morning we'll go

Seven shades of green
Are painted on your door
Painted on your door

The field alive under the snow
Oh early, early in the morning we'll go

Oh world of rooftops, hearing one field song
The walk in raincoats, the wait for Easter, Tom
We are awake or waking, awake or waking from
Here that day comes

Look out for spring
The life underground
The life underground

The thawing and the overflow
Oh early, early in the morning we'll go

Oh world of rooftops, hearing one field song
The walk in raincoats, the wait for Easter, Tom
We are awake or waking, awake or waking from"
spun,chelsea wolfe,"I lift my eyes, I slow my gait
And I never wanna see you again
You leave me restless, you leave me hung
You leave me coiled, you leave me

Spun, spun, spun

Awaken in a tangle of wire
I slept desperate, trying to reach you
You leave me reckless, you leave me sick
I destroy myself and then I want it again

Spun, spun, spun, spun
Spun, spun, spun

Heavy love
Coiled and spun

A brute, an angel, and a madwoman
A most elegant impediment
Was there from the start
Waiting and repeating within me
Waiting and repeating
My problem is their downthrow and upheaval
And my enquiry is as to their working
And my effort is their self-expression
But I was only rock, dust, water, and ice
And animal instincts all along
The hyperosmia and the base sense
The prodrome and the aura
The shadows and the sleep deprivation
The trichomes and the deliriants
Cut through the fear conditioning
To finally understand
It was all and everything or nothing

And all and everything or nothing
And all and everything or nothing
And all and everything or nothing
And all and everything or nothing
And all and everything or nothing
And all and everything or nothing
And all and everything or nothing
And all and everything or nothing
And all and everything or nothing"

I was just another stranger in your bed
But I remember showing you, one thing you won't forget
So here's a little note for you, it says: ""please reply

No heart or head or mind
No season could erase
We set you down
To care for us

A vision fading fast
A million hearts to one
So restrained
She turns away
Stanlow

I've seen her face in every day
The same routine along the way
Tonight in the rain
Alone

And then again it's been so long
Since one single promise kept
All to say to
Reason
We wanted a heart
To say what we want to

A morning comes just as it left
A warmer feeling seldom owned
And tonight
All I see
Alone
And as she turned we always knew
That her heart was never there"

Earphones glued to my head

And I'd be better than I was before

I'd feel so important

If only I knew you

There I got to meet you
And your gold glitter fell all over me
Then I shook your hand
Took some of your lustre
I told my friends that you were just a man
Real nice, not tough
None of that phony star stuff
And I'm better than I was before
Because I have you

Once again, I find myself with my friends, dancing the night away,
Its like the party never ends.
Then again we don't want it to stop, 'cause tonight's the night it goes sweatbox, laser beams, flashing lights, wild cards,
Men from Mars, dressed in Stars and stripes,
Eclectic electric
Ladies of the evening
Drinking booze and mingling .

Mashing to the music, I can do anything
Freaky dicky star speckles and pink butterflies
And life is nice, so nice.
I walk into a club and I've found paradise,
I'm seeing stars, I can't believe my eyes.

Like the record spins on the trails we blaze
The walls are closing in but that's ok because I've been waiting all week to feel this way and it feels so good, so good.
I'm on top of the world the coolest kid in the neighbourhood
So let me be your star for one night that's right.
Sweatbox, laser beams, flashing lights, you've got to feel the rush, feel the spice of life.
Love-life, Shifty rolls the dice snake eyes surprise.
Iceing.Mesmorizing. the minds are sick ones 'cause what we are, is victims of fun.
Come on, come on, the fun is just begun; come on the fun is just begun. Ha Ha!

For the mirror on the wall
Dreaming that the looking glass is you
Catching my fondest gazes
Livin' through my fickeled phases
I love you

Spend my dimes on phones
Trying just to talk
But you don't answer
You let it ring
Spend my nights alone
Catching falling stars
To give to you love
There just for you

Stars fall ev'ry time
A lover has to face the truth
And far to many stars have fell on me
And as they trail the skies
I burn their paths upon my eyes
I cry

And it's getting easier
Each day to weep about you
Harder ev'ry night to sleep
Without you

How many years must I be
Driven by this dream of love

Won't be no scenery, no part of the machinery
I go on and on but never below
So, now you see me and know, you can check it and go

'Cause I'm so bored that I can't even pretend no more
It's so pathetic that I'm rolling around on the floor
Laughing at one big gag
And every now and then they pull another rabbit out of the bag

Of sad diversions, useless tedious excursions
Roll into unrealistic, crypto-fascistic
Comedy doctrine, kick the ballistics
Again and again and again, just say when

Ya had enough, sad enough or mad enough
To do something simple and kind
Now is the time
A change of state of mind

I am a loner, a zoner, I utilize the microphone
And if they try a tap, I leave 'em hangin' on the telephone
Wasted, so wasted, so
They're waiting for the visitors so they can go and try again

On the next step, on the next one
Come on and get some, jet some, static
Solid state, automatic
Sporadic and random 'cause nobody planned 'em

Anarchy, free thought can't be bought
So, disregard the lessons and the shit you've been taught
I'm saying it and now they're playing it to me
Larger than life every day and this is what they say

Shut your mouth and get back in line
And if you don't like it, well, it suits us just fine
We pull the levers, we hold the strings
And these are just a few of our favorite things

Learn the words of the company song
White is right is right is strong, come on children all sing along
'Cause if you think you can change
You were never more wrong

No, fuck that, you won't take me, you won't break me
And you'll never make me, step in line and step march in time
Well, you can violate my body but my soul is still mine
You must think that I'm fucking stupid, man

If you think I'm gonna hang with the program, some fool schedule
I don't give a shit about what is or isn't cool
I make the rules, I stand alone
And if they try a tap, I leave 'em hangin' on the telephone

One of these days I'm gonna get sectioned
I bet they even say it's for my own protection
Rejection leads straight to correction
Look out, here comes a strange injection

They've got a drug to numb my erection
But they won't take this from me
My state of mind, it won't change me
My state of mind, state of mind

Ohh, change me, ohh, change my fate
State of mind"

Hope your're feeling very clear

Thoughts of changes that
Keep ourselves intact

And yes
It's hard to fake but I'm faltering
In the steps I'm about to take
I am sure it's true

Would turn to flesh with teeth of pearl
Would they be kind enough to comfort me
The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free

So we wait and see
How this backward chapter reads
In verse inadvertently
And it feels like fading light
But that's all that's left

Only what's left is right

Jumping from a balloon
A carried aloft by a parachute in June
Twisting round and round
Well I hope the ground is what you find

The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free"

Slipped out from this aching bruise
Status: Weapon is defused.
Ooh, c'est tout
Broken girls, when rag-doll used,
Can't be expected to be true

You beg for mercy, but I refuse
Step off!
You have been excused

You are twisted and unsure
You see her lipstick and pearls
And want to devour her
But now she's tearing up your insides
All claws and fur
Get up!
Give us a smile
Get up!
Get out of this
At least for a while
Get up!
Ooh, c'est tout
Tortured dolls will become cruel
Porcelain repaired with glue
Can't hush the shrieking of a wound
So deep it's feral through and through

That you were there
Along my side companionship so true
You'd pick me up when I was down
You took my fist without a sound
Made me smile with no one else around
Now you're gone

Well I miss you so much more than words explain
Well I hear your name
And I need you farther more than ever, now

A loyal love you gave to me everything
That I needed free
Everything I wanted the pedigree
But then you had to go away
I know I'll see you again someday
Promise me you'll remember the good old days
While you're gone

Well I miss you so much more than words explain
Well I hear your name
And I need you farther more than ever, now

Memories now haunting me I never took the time
To say I'm sorry darling
For every time I crossed the line
So can you please forgive me
And let me show to you
How I go insane
When I hear your name
Remember all the pain that I caused to you

Well I miss you so much more than words explain
Well I hear your name
And I need you farther more than ever, now"

Sideways, back and forth
Wake up, hit the floor
Oh no, where'd you go?
It will come to you

One more day like this
One more poison kiss
One more hand to fist

Touch the bottom you and i

Stay or leave i want you not to go but you did

You used to laugh under the covers
Maybe not so often now

Was loud and hard

Just to hear it fall is the sweetest soundin' thing
And to see it fall on your simple country dress
It's like heaven to me, I must confess

'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
I always have to steal my kisses from you

Now I've been hangin' 'round you for days
But when I'm leanin', you just turn your head away
Woh, no you didn't mean that
She said, ""I love the way you think, but I hate the way you act""

'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you

Rise to the top, never stop
Drop like cream
U bring the body and
I'll bring the steam

Going out while the tides in

Hard or nice n' easy
Smooth with the move to sooth
Dry or greasy

Here is your friend
Kindred spirit of ethereal blend
Meet me on a cloud
Go on a journey, sure
I'll take your body on a mystery tour

The clock upon your wall
Is tickin' slower and slower
Time disappears as I go
Lower and lower
I know your final fantasy
But I can't repeat that
Doubting about me
Bet you doubt, I'll defeat that
I'm your spiritual dancer
Your emotion enhancer
Anyway you wanna go
Whether below or on top

I'm your lover non stop

Outside it's raining but inside is wet"

And when you've been out through the night, and I gently ask
You, ""where you've been?""
You trip out on me, make my world come crashing down

With no more angry words to say can come alive
Get into a car and drive to the other side
Into the night, into the light

We are young but getting old before our time
We'll leave the TV and the radio behind
Don't you wonder what we'll find
Steppin' out tonight?

You can dress in pink and blue just like a child
And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile
We'll be there in just a while, if you follow

I'm still alive I will never give up

Just turn off the lights
Don't wanna see me die
I look like I'm dead
But when you look at me
I am still alive

Just open your eyes
Don't wanna see me cry
I'm right here where you want me to be
Fighting with myself, with myself

Just turn off the lights
Don't wanna see me die
I look like I'm dead
But when you look at me
I am still alive

Won't you open your eyes
Don't wanna see me cry
I'm right here where you want me to be
Fighting with myself
I'm right here where you want me to be
Fighting with myself
I'm right here where you want me to be
Fighting with myself, with myself.

Ooh, I look like I'm dead
But when you look at me
I'm still alive"
still breathing,green day,"I'm like a child looking off in the horizon
I'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens

I'm like a soldier coming home for the first time
I dodged a bullet, and I walked across a landmine
Oh-oh-oh, I'm still alive

Am I bleeding?
Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
My way to you

I'm like a junkie tying off for the last time
I'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime
Oh-oh-oh, I'm still alive
I'm like a son that was raised without a father
I'm like a mother barely keeping it together
Oh-oh-oh, I'm still alive

Am I bleeding?
Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away, away

As I walked out on the ledge
Are you scared to death to live?
And I've been running all my life
Just to find a home that's for the restless
And the truth that's in the message
Making my way away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away (My way to you)
'Cause I'm still breathing (My way to you)
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
My way to you"

stolen car,patty griffin,"I met a little girl and I settled down
In a little house on out on the edge of town
We got married, swore we'd never part
Then little by little we drifted from eachother's hearts

At first I thought it was just restlessness
That would fade as time went by and our love grew deep
In the end it was something more I guess
Tore us apart and made us weep

I'm driving a stolen car
Down on Eldridge Avenue
Each night I wait to get caught
But I never do

She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote
When our love was young and bold
She said last night she read those letters
And they made her feel one hundred years old

I'm driving a stolen car
On a pitch black night
And I'm telling myself
It's gonna be all right

I drive by night
And I travel in fear
That in this darkness
I will disappear"

Why don't you look into your heart boy
You've got to set her free
Or just let me be
Cause I can't live in the back seat

A different kind of love is
What you're giving to me
Stolen moments are too few
Cause I want to spend my life with you

I'm at your beck and call
Though you do me wrong
You've got to choose between her and me boy
Can't take this tug of war
Can't take it anymore
It seemed you were the one for me boy
I've done the best I can
And now it's up to you
All I wnat to know is where we stand

A different kind of love is
What you're giving to me

And catch the last weekend of the last week
Before the gold and the glimmer have been replaced
Another sun soaked season fades away

Invitation only grant farewells
Crash the best one of the best ones
Clear liquor and cloudy eyed
Too early to say goodnight
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart
And from the ballroom floor we are in celebration
One good stretch before our hibernation
Our dreams assured and we all
We'll sleep well
Sleep well
Sleep well
Sleep well

You have stolen my heart
I watch you spin around in your highest heels

It's the liquid that I miss

Sonic juice inside my head
This fever is so concentrated
Oh no what a shame...

The gaunt fruit of passion
Dies in the light

streetlights,ludo,"When the streetlights come on
The pooling night is leveed aside
And pressed in twilight 'gainst our two rooms
I'll see you tonight
The pavement is aching, cicadas are crying
The wine-colored air breathing thoughts through your hair
Breezing to me, leading me there...

I come alive as the shadows parade
My hot summer blood comes in floods and in waves
Curbside confessions, no longer afraid of what you'll say

And I find you, twilit beyond all the cars
In driveways they sleep but streetlights will keep watch over me
They flicker like stars
And now the secrets carefully kept inside, run the streets red
Our chemicals spread, washing us through, making you mine...

I come alive as the shadows parade
My hot summer blood comes in floods and in waves
Curbside confessions, no longer afraid of what you'll say

Now there are no words, only the glow in our wires
And so we will be, you turn slow to me
Our lips set the sun (I'll never leave you...)
The hills are on fire... oh...

I come alive as the shadows parade
My hot summer blood comes in floods and in waves
Curbside confessions, no longer afraid of what you'll say"

But eversince I think of you
Over and over again, over and over again

Over and over again, over and over again"
stress,jim's big ego,"I'm addicted to stress, that's the way that I get things done,
If I'm not under pressure then I sleep too long,
And I hang around like a bum,
I think I'm goin' nowhere, and that makes me nervous.
Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright,
Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright,
Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright,
Everybody's thinkin' 'bout me!
It's the little things that get you,
It's the little things that get you when you work in addiction.
It's the little things that get you,
It's the little things that get you,
It's the little things that get you when you work in addiction.
I'm tryin' to cut down on my caffeine consumption,
So when I get up, I just have one cup of coffee,
And I like to have another cup of coffee with my breakfast,
And on my way to work, I like to get a cup of coffee.
Like the kind of cup of coffee that you get with the doughnuts,
But I never get the doughnut, I just have the cup of coffee.
And when I get to work, I like to have a cup of coffee,
'cause I like to have coffee when I'm talkin' on the phone,
But it usually goes cold, and you need to get another cup of coffee,
And it's lunch, and I have an espresso.
And when I get back, it's not morning anymore,
So I have a diet cola, and another diet cola,
By then I'm feelin' fine, and I'm feelin' pretty sharp,
And I'm feelin' pretty wired and I'm getting things done.
But right about two I get this little tiny migraine.
It starts with my eyes, and moves to the back of my neck,
And moves to the bottom of my spine,
But it doesn't get there until five or six o'clock,
Which is the end of the day,
So I'm fine,
So I'm fine,
So I'm fine,
So I'm fine,
So I'm fine,
Except when I have to work late,
When I have to work late, which I usually do,
I'm addicted to stress, that's the way that I get things done,
If I'm not under pressure then I sleep too long,
And I hang around like a bum, and I think I'm goin' nowhere and that makes me nervous.
Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright,
Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright,
Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright,
Everybody's thinkin' 'bout me!
Hey, how you doin'?
Lookin' good!
You been workin' out?
Yeah, I can tell.
Alright, see you later!
I love to work, I love to run, I love to play real hard.
I love to steal little things from the grocery store,
Like a piece of bubble gum, or sometimes I just stick my thumb in a peach,
And leave it there.
I love to work, I love to run, I love to waterski, snowboard, jetski, skydive, parasail, hang-glide, roller-blade, mountain-bike, bungee-jump...
Well, I mean, I'd love to do these things,
If I ever had the time.
I love to work, I love to work, I love to work out after work,
I'd love to spend a little time with this woman I'm seeing,
Except, uh, we never really get any time to spend together,
So, we call eachother up, and we talk about work.
But what I think I'd really love is to get up by myself,
On a little tiny island, in the middle of the ocean,
With just me, and a book, and a cellular phone,
And a personal computer in case something came up.
And I could eat, and I'd drink, and I'd run and I'd sleep,
And I wouldn't do nothin' except swim all day,
Except, ya know, my beeper doesn't work under water,
Where there are sharks!
Where there are sharks!!
Where there are sharks!!!
And there's this kind of anemone that sticks in your foot,
And the poisen goes up to your brain,
And you die!
And sand fleas!
Sand fleas!! yuck!!
But, actually I think it'd be really relaxing,
Just to be by myself, in the middle of the ocean,
And that's what I'd really love to do, more than anything else,
Except, I'd probably hate it.
I'm addicted to stress, that's the way that I get things done,
If I'm not under pressure then I sleep too long,
And I hang around like a bum,
I think I'm goin' nowhere, and that makes me nervous.

strong enough,stacie orrico,"As I rest against this cold, hard wall
Will you pass me by?
Will you criticize me as I sit and cry?
I had fought so hard, and thought that all my battles had been won
Only to find the war has just begun

Is he not strong enough?
Is he not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is he not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please, can I have one chance to start again?

Will my weakness for an hour make me suffer for a lifetime?
Is there any way to be made whole again?
If I'm healed, renewed, and find forgiveness
Find the strength I've never had
Will my scars forever ruin all God's plan?

Is he not strong enough?
Is he not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is he not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please, can I have one chance to start again?

He took my life into his hands and turned it all around
In my most desperate circumstance
It's there I've finally found

That you are strong enough
That you are pure enough
To break me, pour me out and start again
That you are brave enough
To take one chance on me
Oh, thank you for my chance to start again"
struck,joe henry,"I've been having wicked thoughts
Terribly wicked, selfish and cruel
Imagining I stood high on a ledge
And fell just out of the reach of you

And then, we are together alone
As I fall, you look up?
Looking for all the world, like for once
It was you, not me, who had been struck

Should I love you more than I do?
Or pray to love you less
Or learn to live with the little you give
Believing it all for the best

Will I ever see your heart
Open wide and your eyes shut
Looking for all the world, like for once
It was you, not me, who had been struck

The trees are angry, toss in the wind
Devour small planes going by
Dropping wreckage, bags and gloves
Down around us where we lie

I hear your uneasy breath
As you stir, but don't wake up
Looking for all the world, like for once
It was you, not me, who had been struck
That had been struck... that had been struck... that had been struck"
strung out,wendy & lisa,"Watching my hands shake
I look up at you with a smile
Shy is what I am with you
I'm scared of how much I love you
And all I can do is pray
That you won't run the other way

[Chorus]
Strung out on love, I need your kiss
Strung out because I know it's bliss
Strung out on love, I can't resist
Strung out because I know it's bliss

Love makes a fool of me
What a futile way to begin
Life threatens unity
Hearts like mine hold fast for a friend
Beauty is you, I feel you
Underneath my skin

[Chorus]

Won't you smile for me?
You can set my mind free
Heartache and hope I feel
And I'll reach out
Hoping to find you there
Fix this broken heart for me, I'm -

I know it's bliss
I know it's bliss"

The smell of the warm summer air

I live in a town
Where you can't smell a thing

Making home movies
For the folks back home

Of all these weird creatures
Who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves
And live for their secrets

They're all uptight

Late at night while I'm driving
Take me on board of their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends

But they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars

And the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be all right
All right

such great heights,iron & wine,"I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God Himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

And true it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay

I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat
It sounded thin upon listening

And that frankly will not fly
You'll hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down

They will see us waving from such great heights

But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay"

We still don't know
If what we want is wrong, I just love hearing you say
""Oh please don't go""
Darling can't you keep your head next to my head?
Oh just stay here
Because I can't fall asleep even in my own bed
Until you're near
No, you'll go away, of course that's not what I want
Oh I've missed you
That's what I thought you'd say but you must know that I can't
Resist you

You suck it all right out of me
You suck it all right out of me

I didn't have to search for you, I knew where you'd be hiding
You astound me
There's nothing I won't do to feel your body sliding
All around me
No, no, no, don't stop, I think I must be dreaming
I'll just hold you
I'm just about to drop, you thrill me with your screaming
I adore you

You suck it all right out of me
You suck it all right out of me
You suck it all right out of me
You suck it all"

There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly
You're in love

Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah

Girl, you're everything
A man could want, and more
One thousand words are not enough
To say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before
Now you're all I'm living for

Suddenly
Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly
You're in love

Each day
I pray
This love affair would last forever

Ooh, ooh, suddenly
Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above

summer days,phoenix,"I've spent all summer days driving
I'm tired of holidays ruined
No more take-away's, expired food
I need a real day
Time runs faster when you're loaded
Bright lights blind me all weak
Living in the city, I'm a high-speed drill
I need a full day diving
Tons of heavyweight food
Roosters from the sister islands too
I'd better get working
I'm bored with all that brainwashing
Let's break all separate rooms
Changing's no fun if you don't want to
I need a good day sailing
To tell the sun and the moon
That I am turning for no reasons too
And I keep waiting
Driving to the gas station
Caught by a traffic jam blues
Life is nonsense, I don't have a clue
I need a cool day riding
Feeding all the horses at dawn
Searching for the truffles, going through the woods
Then I'll be waiting
I've passed all summer days driving
I'm tired of holidays ruined
No more take-away's, expired food
I need a full day diving
Tons of heavyweight food
Roosters from the sister islands too
I'd better get working"
summer in the city,regina spektor,"Summer in the city
Means cleavage, cleavage, cleavage
And I start to miss you
Baby, sometimes
I've been staying up and
Drinking in the late night establishment
Telling strangers
Personal things

Summer in the city
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely
So I went
To a protest
Just to rub up
Against strangers
And I did feel like coming, but I also felt like crying
It doesn't seem so
Worth it right now

And the castrated ones
Stand in the corner, smoking
They want to feel the bulges in their pants start to rise
At the sight of a beautiful woman, they feel nothing but
But anger, her skin makes them sick in the night
Nauseous, nauseous, nauseous

Summer in the city
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely
I've been hallucinating you, babe
At the backs of other women
And I tap
On their shoulder
And they turn around, smiling, but
There's no recognition in their eyes

Ohhh, summer in the city
Means cleavage, cleavage, cleavage
And don't get me wrong, dear
In general, I
Think I'm doing quite
Fine
It's just, when it's summer in the city, and you're
Long gone from the city
I start to miss you
Baby, sometimes

When it's summer in the city
And you're, you're so long gone from the city
I start to miss you

Start to miss you

You always will be my summer love
Wish that we could be alone now
If we could find some place to hide
Make the last time just like the first time
Push a button and rewind
Don't say the word that's on your lips
Don't look at me that way
Just promise you'll remember
When the sky is grey
'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

We can't take this any farther
And I know there's nothing that I wanna change, change

There's no need, baby I've gone there
Stars shone there.

And they shine
To luminate the distance
Illustrate the difference
Between you and me
See them collide with clouds
That set the sky free
Indicating right, indicating wrong
And just like anyone
I wanna see the sun
I wanna see the moon
I wanna see the stars
I wanna see them shine."

You want me to tell you somethin'?
""Uh huh""
I know what you wanna hear

I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
""I think I love you baby""
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl
Come be in Shady's world
""Oh boy, you drive me crazy""
Bitch you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell a mo'fuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, hit my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
What you Mariah? Fly through twice

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, hoe

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman

I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
You'll never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride between you and I
Not a jealous man but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go

First thing you said
""I'm not phazed""
""I hang around big stars all day""
""I don't see what the big deal is anyway""
""You're just plain ol' Marshall to me""

Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
""Hailie Jade? I love that name""
""Love that tattoo, what's that say?""
""Rotten pieces?""
""Aww that's great""
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good lordy-wody, you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Oooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands
Put Anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass

surf's up,brian wilson,"A diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along, oh
To a handsome man and baton (Bygone, bygone)
A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn (Bygone, bygone)
Columnated ruins domino

Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping?

Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn (Bygone, bygone)
The music hall, a costly bow
The music, all is lost for now
To a muted trumperter swan (Bygone, bygone)
Columnated ruins domino

Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?

Dove-nested towers the hour was
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
Two-step to lamp lights cellar tune
The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne

The glass was raised, the fired rose
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
While at port, adieu or die

A choke of grief heart hardened I
Beyond belief, a broken man too tough to cry

Surf's up, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song

A children's song (Child, child, child, the child is father of the man)
Have you listened as they played? (Child, child, child, the child is father of the man)
Their song is love (Child, child, child, the child is father of the man)
And the children know the way (Child, child, child, the child is father of the man)

suzanne,alain bashung,"Suzanne t'emmène écouter les sirènes
Elle te prend par la main
Pour passer une nuit sans fin
Tu sais qu'elle est à moitié folle
C'est pourquoi tu veux rester
Sur un plateau d'argent

Elle te sert du thé au jasmin
Et quand tu voudrais lui dire
Tu n'as pas d'amour pour elle
Elle t'appelle dans ses ondes
Et laisse la mer répondre
Que depuis toujours tu l'aimes
Tu veux rester à ses côtés
Maintenant, tu n'as plus peur
De voyager les yeux fermés
Une flamme brûle dans ton coeur

Il était un pêcheur venu sur la terre
Qui a veillé très longtemps
Du haut d'une tour solitaire
Quand il a compris que seuls
Les hommes perdus le voyaient
Il a dit qu'on voguerait
Jusqu'à ce que les vagues nous libèrent
Mais lui-même fut brisé
Bien avant que le ciel s'ouvre
Délaissé et presqu'un homme
Il a coulé sous votre sagesse

Comme une pierre
Tu veux rester à ses côtés
Maintenant, tu n'as plus peur
De voyager les yeux fermés
Une flamme brûle dans ton coeur
Suzanne t'emmène écouter les sirènes
Elle te prend par la main
Pour passer une nuit sans fin
Comme du miel, le soleil coule
Sur Notre Dame des Pleurs
Elle te montre où chercher
Parmi les déchets et les fleurs
Dans les algues, il y a des rêves

Des enfants au petit matin
Qui se penchent vers l'amour
Ils se penchent comme ça toujours
Et Suzanne tient le miroir
Tu veux rester à ses côtés
Maintenant, tu n'as plus peur
De voyager les yeux fermés
Une blessure étrange dans le coeur"

And this bread, your body

I know, I know, I know, you know

Come alone
From the garden to the hill
Come my love
I have fallen
I have betrayed

So irresolute in my mind
I can't stop pacing, anticipating
Could this be my fate in the end?
Cause I'm afraid in the light of the look in your eyes when they're locked on mine
I turn away, cause I know you see right through me

Come alone
From the garden to the hill
Come my love
I have fallen
I have betrayed you

Here I lie
My guilt is my sentence
You have been my life
I will end it with a kiss

Come alone, my love

And you've never touched a deer

A deer, a deer, my dear

Lay down sweating first,
Roll around sweating first,

Walk down the easiest road,
The refuge of the easiest road.

And the evening hours,
The easiest road.

Hurting runs off my shoulder

How can I hurt when I'm holding you?

Cuz I tell 'em bout you without tellin' 'em shit
She just pink vibe playa move, and you don't do the same
Now she see what's real from lame, what's fiction from facts
What's bullshit from brilliance, you still fucking hoes with yo feelings

Look in my momma's eyes be my main motivation
Blinded by phone posits, footsteps stay tracing
And I can make history just like that one president
Causing damage to the city like a new element
Oakland California, started our own nation
Been playin' bitch since a 'who will I sleep with?'
And at the end of the day, Levodka ak
I'd rather finger her cuz she won't cheat anyway
The radio sleepin' on the west coast
I don't see why, we got some of the best notes
Pretty lady on the left, I slip her a note from my handbook
And what you tell her? Along as you can cook and clean
Do your heart and get took, play by the rules of my own handbook
You niggas ain't fuckin' with me / stretch!
These niggas ain't fuckin' with me
You niggas fuckin' with me?! It's like 2Pac hangin' with Diddy
All the cops fuckin' with my city
Wadn't fuckin' with me now, wadn't fuckin' with me then
Couple hit songs will turn my enemies into my friends
Oakland, nigga

Young local, big money still social
Playin' em off Logic, made a mill of Pro Tools
BAack then I was broke so I would never by an old school
All bad memories so everything is so new
Pull up with that cannon and drama, I'm finna get this man
You a gangsta or ya surd? What it is, man?
Yo niggas say you this, yo family say you that
With yo switchin' ass, you that dress on Instagram
Yo girl at the queer bendin' ova and moonin'
Hit her on the table and made her pacing vaturity(?!)
Evolve last year? Not me, cuz it was foolery
I ain't wanna be a freshman, that requires niggas schoolin' me
Made it from my city, nigga, same that gon' diss you
Here, you can take the microphone with ya
Let the doorknob hit you where the good lord spit you
Cuz in (?!) you gon' have the good lord with ya
One man army, I'm the jet and the missile
Here the same shit, and disciple like the mistril
All these niggas chicken talkin' they gon' bail with ya
But don't eva wanna meet, so they leave me with the grizzle"
sweet song,blur,"What am I to do
Someone here is really not happy
Put myself on a line
It seems I never got through to you
So I wean myself off slowly

I'm a darkened soul
My streets all pop music and gold
All our lives are on TV
You switch off and try to sleep
People get so lonely

I believe I believe I believe
Everything's out to sea
I believe I believe I believe I believe
That is the way it should be
I hope you feel the same

Everyone is dying
Stop crying now here comes the sun
I didn't mean to hurt you no no no
It takes time to see what you have done
So I wean myself off slowly

I believe I believe I believe
Love is the only one
I deceive I deceive I deceive I deceive
'Cause I'm not that strong
Hope you feel the same

And now it seems that we're falling apart
But I hope I see the good in you come back again
I just believed in you"
sweet surrender,tim buckley,"Now you wanna know the reason
Why I cheated on you?
Well, I had to be a hunter again
This little man had to try
To make love feel new again

'Cause there's just a few things, honey
I'm not old enough to do for you, ohh
And they're the things, momma
You just never care to show me, ohh

So this flim-flam lover boy
Found him a flamingo
And his flamingo
Showed him how to tango

And when they tangoed
It'd send their hearts a flutter
Teased him 'till he'd stutter
Made him so young and tender

Sweet to surrender
And so sweet surrender
In sweet surrender
Ahh, sweet surrender to love

But now you're gonna go out
And get yourself a reputation
But I'm gonna have to show you
Where to start

And then you're gonna bring back
Your little reputation
And prove to me
What I could not prove to you

'Cause I was just too young at heart
I'm just too cold, honey
Just too hard to care
Just too hard, 'right
To surrender
Surrender to love

Sweet surrender
Surrender to love

If we could
Just surrender
Love would heal the mess we've made
So give it up, momma, ahh
It ain't gonna be no good
It keeps goin' round and round

You hurt me
Then I hurt you again
All that's left to do, ahh
Is give it up, ahh-ha-ha
No, no, give it up
And surrender, ahh-ha-ha, momma

Sweet surrender
Sweet surrender
Surrender your love
Surrender love
Ohh, surrender, momma
Ohh, surrender that love

Sweet, sweet, sweet, surrender, momma
You to love
To love
To love"
sweet talk,dear and the headlights,"Speak dumb like every other one

I'd rather let you fall apart

Oh you forgot I called
Don't take it personal personal honey
I know you've just been busy or
You need to be alone
Well you can call me when you're bored
I'll sing a song low
Over the telephone
In lower decibels
So you can hear it and hear it and hear it and hear it
And lost it though
You've lost that privilege
With a hundred more
Hold his hand now
Out on the mission field
Your hearts compatible
Mine breaks alone alone alone
Your new boyfriend
You got your new boyfriend
You got your new boyfriend
You got your new boyfriend
I bet he likes you more than he likes me 'cause
I'm the former one
He's the latter one
He'd never say it but it's right
I'm sorry that was rude of me
Forget I said a thing
But don't forget it when you're starring at him
Say something you mean
Don't be polite
Kiss, kill nothing in between
I can't sit still, sit still
Get canceled, can't sit still
Not when you got, you got, you got
Your new boyfriend
You got your new boyfriend
You got your new boyfriend
You got your new boyfriend
I bet he likes you more than he likes me 'cause
I'm the former
He's the latter one
He'd never say it but it's right
Passed on up and over
Said she did
Said she didn't come on
Pass me up
Let me go
Throw away
Let me go

Be the same

You've got him, oh"

I'd make you another offer will it do the trick

All my days inactive will be justified
Awaken from a slumber to a rollercoaster ride
Don't get wise to everyone and everything
Leave a little room for some naiveté

To say that we will never part
And you will always have my heart
Is something that I can't deny
And you must never ever try
To go and lead a separate life
It's something I will never do, without you

To say that we will never part

Smoking in my room crying over you

Push you up, I pull you down

Followed to the other side
Take off clothes and in we dive
Swimming till the moon shines, right, right

Everything else fades in mist
This is all a lie, got it all in my mind
If it's not real life, this could be a perfect lie

See your dress underneath the sunset
Suits you well, you're the sunset, suits you well

If it's all fool, a big lie
You wouldn't tell me this part
If it's just a silly play
You wouldn't let me get this far

Working you undercover

The friend too good to go there with
Let's shake it up and get it on

You've always got your reasons

take me as i am,carly simon,"You imagine when you see her
That she's nothing less that perfect
That she has no aspirations
Beyond driving in her car
The car she looks so good in
Will she ever look that good again
You'll never have to know
Because she's gone

She passes in the left lane
And you're turned on by the chase
Her hair flies in the wind
As your mind begins to race
The grass is always greener
But I wish you could have seen her
Drunk and lying with the gutter in her face

Take me as I am
Take me as I am
For the woman that I am
Take me as I am

You think she knows the bible
And can swin the English Channel
Writes novels in her spare time
In a cabin in the woods
You wish I'd gone to college
And you wish I'd let my hair grow
You wish I didn't have so many moods

Take me as I am
Take me as I am
For the woman that I am
Take me as I am
Take me as I am

Once you said you were in love with me
And maybe you still are
But the passion you once showed me
Now is lost among the stars
And you fancy some new fancy girl
Will come and change your life around
But she just turned the corner in her car

While for some other dreamin' driver
I am that romantic stranger
Lookin' better than I am
More mysterious by far
Speeding through his dreams
While I'm drivin' in my car

Take me as I am
Take me as I am

And the snake's in the bower

Between cross and mother

Take me with you
Take me with you"
take me,chris & carla,"Take me to your darkest room
Close all the windows and bolt all the doors
From the first moment I heard your voice
I'll be in darkness no more

Take me to your most barren desert
A thousand miles from the nearest sea
The very moment I see your smile
It was like heaven to me

There's not a mountain too rocky to climb
No desert to barren to cross
Darling if you were to show me a sign
Of love I could bear your loss

Take me to Siberia
The coldest weather of any wintertime
And it would be just like spring in California
As long as I knew you were mine

Take me
Take me
Take me
Take me"
take my hand,the cab,"Calm your nerves now
Don't worry
Just breathe
Are you sure now
Don't bother packing
Just leave
Said they wanted change
I hope that
You remain the same
To show that
This is not a game
Lets end this tragedy today
Now take my hand
And we will run away
Down to this place that I know
How did this night become the enemy
It's over, it's over, it's over.
Lay down with me
Let me hold you
Baby just breathe
This is ending and we will get through eventually
Said they wanted change
I hope that
You remain the same
To show that this is not a game
We'll end this tragedy today
Now take my hand
And we will run away
Down to this place that I know
How did this night become the enemy
It's over, it's over, it's over.
Now take my hand
And we will run away
Down to this place that I know
How did this night become the enemy
It's over, it's over, it's over.
We wont be apart of
We wont be apart of this
We wont be apart of
We wont be apart of this
We wont be apart of
We wont be apart of this
We wont be apart of
We wont, we wont.
Now take my hand
And we will run away
Down to this place that I know
How did this night become the enemy
It's over, it's over, it's over.
Now take my hand
And we will run away
Down to this place that I know
How did this night become the enemy
It's over, it's over, it's over.
Now take my hand
And we will run away
Down to this place that I know
How did this night become the enemy
It's over, it's over, it's over.

We wont be apart of
We wont, we wont."

take your time,low,"So she waits on the edges of the mattress
What it takes to get a bad mess out of a bad dress

When she speaks, she thanks the good Lord for the Holy Ghost

talk of the town,mohair,"I'm waiting on a friend on my own
In a town that I used to know
It happens everytime I come back
There's a high before every low
I spent a long time running the long way 'round
So why, oh, why...

Do we need
Something to talk about?
So much to laugh about
Go get a little love

If you'd like to take it back to before
There's a door I could push you through
Like it or not we never got
Where we wanted to start anew
I got my right brain working the wrong way 'round
So why, oh, why...

Should we need
Something to talk about?
So much to laugh about
Go get a little love

We just need
A place we can be without
The small talk of the town
Something to talk about

Waiting on a friend on my own
In a town that I used to know
Staring a hole in the rose-coloured
Glasses of long ago
I spent a long time running the long way 'round
So why, oh, why...

Do we need
Something to talk about?
So much to laugh about
Go get a little love

We just need
A place we can be without
The small talk of the town
Something to talk about"
talk to me,blue foundation,"It doesn't matter what you say
Cause it's written on the wall
There's no need to exaggerate
But I think this time we spoiled it all
We were heading for at spin
Where we were bound to win
We were dynamite
We would scandalize
And outrage and mesmerize
Others stopped where we'd begin
We were bound to win
But eventually
It turned out to be
A fantasy
You say you wanna walk with me
But you're always on the run
You're sure you wanna talk to me?
Cause I say one word and then you're gone
Walking in circles around the core
Tell me what it is
That you fear, what makes you withdraw?
Burn this land"
tam lin,fairport convention,"I forbid you maidens all that wear gold in your hair
To travel to Carterhaugh for young Tam Lin is there

None that go by Carterhaugh but they leave him a pledge
Either their mantles of green or else their maidenhead

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to Carterhaugh as fast as go can she

She'd not pulled a double rose, a rose but only two
When up then came young Tam Lin, says ""Lady, pull no more""

""And why come you to Carterhaugh without command from me?""
""I'll come and go"", young Janet said, ""and ask no leave of thee""

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to her father as fast as go can she

Well, up then spoke her father dear and he spoke meek and mild
""Oh, and alas, Janet,"" he said, ""I think you go with child""

""Well, if that be so,"" Janet said, ""myself shall bear the blame
There's not a knight in all your hall shall get the baby's name""

For if my love were an earthly knight as he is an elfin grey
I'd not change my own true love for any knight you have""

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to Carterhaugh as fast as go can she

""Oh, tell to me, Tam Lin,"" she said, ""why came you here to dwell?""
""The Queen of Faeries caught me when from my horse I fell

And at the end of seven years she pays a tithe to Hell
I so fair and full of flesh and feared it be myself

But tonight is Hallowe'en and the faerie folk ride
Those that would their true love win at Miles Cross they must bide

First let past the horses black and then let past the brown
Quickly run to the white steed and pull the rider down

For I'll ride on the white steed, the nearest to the town
For I was an earthly knight, they give me that renown

Oh, they will turn me in your arms to a newt or a snake
But hold me tight and fear not, I am your baby's father

And they will turn me in your arms into a lion bold
But hold me tight and fear not and you will love your child

And they will turn me in your arms into a naked knight
But cloak me in your mantle and keep me out of sight""

In the middle of the night she heard the bridle ring
She heeded what he did say and young Tam Lin did win

Then up spoke the Faerie Queen, an angry queen was she
""Woe betide her ill-fought face, an ill death may she die""

""Oh, had I known, Tam Lin,"" she said, ""what this night I did see
I'd have looked him in the eyes and turned him to a tree"""
target,embrace,"You flicker like a mile high neon sign
Hot and cold so no one knows your mind
I was gonna let you win but I won't break
For an hour I held the moon on a string
Now this moment left till the world begins
Everything is possible its beautiful

When will you wake up see what's happening
Right before your eyes no
If you must blow hot and cold take a swing
You will hit the target every time

So I look before I leap and I see
Wolves are at the door with my enemies
I was gonna let them in but then you say
Watch the stars defeating my enemy
It's too far for them to bring you to me
And everything is possible it's beautiful

When will you wake up see whats happening
Right before your eyes no
If you must blow hot and cold take a swing
You will hit the target every time

When will you wake up see whats happening
Right before your eyeyeOhhh
If you must blow hot and cold take a swing
You will hit the target every time

I reached the waters edge
I wished that I could hold
Everybody's breath until
No one has any left
You take me to the edge
You're being called to follow
The foot prints that I left behind
Listen up I'll sing to you how I can
Out of luck now time is all that we have
Think about yourself and you'll kill all you love
I know our makers love all the mess the make
Out of sight behind these eyes you'll stay
Where everything is possible
It's beautiful

When will you wake up see whats happening
Right before your eyeyeOhhh
If you must blow hot and cold take a swing
You will hit the target every time"
taste,magik markers,"The only car on the raw sheet highway is riding
The stars for him are only coat lining
You cannot sweat a piebald horse and make it a steed
I cannot take your want and make it a need

They keep wasting you, wasting you
Just to get a taste you
They've been wasting you, wasting you
Just to get a taste of you

Ted saw a black man's lips
And a movie star's blond
He shook her little bobby sox
Until the thrill was gone, the thrill was gone

He had tasted her, tasted her
Smiled right into the base of her
He kept racing her, racing her
Stayed alive, outpacing her

Blue bore the quiet land the best that he could
He learned war was silent and he understood
The fleshy pages of women wet from the rain
The rising, flooding water, feeling no pain, feeling no pain

Alone waits in him, aches in him
Takes up more than it makes of him
Alone shakes in him, hates in him
Thrums in the subway gate of him

She gathered rocks and twigs up in her skirt
She got the tired, wired drugs to make her get hurt
She ordered nature to her design
She went to sleep and dreamed asleep and it felt more fine, it felt more fine

The drug banked on her, blanked for her
Never bowed to the rank in her
It low-sank in her, drank in her
Never bothered with thanking her

They keep wasting me, wasting me
Eating up more than a taste of me
This time shakes in me, takes of me
Uses up more than it makes of me"

In the middle of the floor

You sit there watching the door

Already feel ill
Tattoo you're bad side
Slap your thigh
Slap your calf
Sing your mantra
Leave your walk

Colour me

Something fits along my spine
Just givin' lovin' from behind
Fortify my arms
Fortify my arms

Colour me

tears of a clown,the english beat,"Said, oh yeah, baby, baby

Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there trying to fool the public
But when it comes down to fooling you
Well now, honey, that's quite a different subject
So don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
'Cause really, I'm sad (so sad, sad)
Oh, I'm sadder than sad (so sad, sad)
Look, I'm hurt and I want you so bad (so sad, sad)
Like a clown, I appear to be glad

Ooh yeah, well there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around

I said, oh yeah, baby, baby, baby
Oh yeah, baby, baby, baby

Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride, I try
To cover it up with a show of gladness
So don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you
Decided to go
Oh, I need you so
Look, I'm hurt and I want you to know
Just for others I put on a show

Ooh yeah, well there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around

So, just like Pagliacci did
I'm gonna keep my sadness hid
Hiding in the gloom, I try
But in this lonely room, I cry
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around

Now, if there's a smile on my face
Well, don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you feel that I don't care

Tears of a clown
Tears of a clown
I'm going down and down
I'm going downtown
Tears of a clown"
tears,da king & i,"A September morning life didnt seem the way it should be
I was just mourning, thinking of all the wrong that was done to me,
now check it
Sitting on my door step thinking with my head down
Alone in my own world with no one left around
Then out of nowhere comes my partner Majesty, asking me
""Yo, Iz why you look like theres been a Tradegy""
Remember the girl from down the block that i was check out?
I was on my way to her house sippin' on a Guiness Stout
Looking jazzy like ya dont know, my jewels were daggling
you can see it on the steering wheel of my Volvo
I wanted to catch a flick and thats all
Sarafina, heard it was playing at King Plaza Mall
Had bad vibes before I got to her crib
But when i did, seen her talking to this light skinned kid.
check it out
It's something that I so despise
Faking moves on the mind of a fool
brings tears to my eyes

Don't cry, don't cry, bring tears to my eyes,
Don't cry don't cry...
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry...

Help her out the ride slam the door, press the alarm, is it on?
Its time to drop the bomb, but remain calm
Should I bring it up or should I just wait?
For her to kick it, dig it,
she was out to get it like Gidget, I figured
Then I asked ""Whos the kid that left your pad?""
Oh, hes a friend of mine, I met him at the study lab, in school
Sounds like the typical, mythical, mystical line
Use my line, but you cant trick me hoe
Then she said she wouldnt let it happen again
He came to the crib to help her out, so she had to let him in
Sho ya right, hes coming in the day, but he's leaving at night (uh huh)
Mama told me they'll be girls like these I said please
I spent money like it grew on tree leaves
It's something that I so so despise
Faking moves on the mind of a fool
brings tears to my eyes

Don't cry, don't cry, bring tears to my eyes
Don't cry don't cry...
Don't cry, don't cry, dont cry...

Another twenty minutes passed, then the phone rang
I picked it up and said ""Hello""
and then her friend asked ""Who is this James?""
Naw, this is Izzy and I dont recall having my name changed
And by the way who is this? ya bear witness, get this
If you were here I'll probably hit you with my Guiness (Stout)
Hung up the phone and got crazy, cause the woman I called my lady
Was playing a role like Patrick Swayze
I just left like a real man should, didnt argue a bit,
feeling real damn good
I heard the brothers say it doesnt pay to be faithful
I learned my lesson that day, and i'm grateful
But i cant face my future or my past
Its hard keeping caution, at the same time watching my cash
Making sure that I dont spend an extra buck, she flipped the script
Mister ""all that"" got fucked, knee deep
Its something that I so despise
Faking moves on a mind of a fool
brings tears to my eyes...

Don't cry, don't cry... what a way to go out
Don't cry, don't cry... it's kinda...
Don't cry... man
It's gonna be alright...
Don't cry... yeah...
bring tears to my eyes...
ha... yeah... ha

technicolor girls,death cab for cutie,"Technicolor girls are always on the phone
Talking about their homes
And the conversations continue endlessly.

Technicolor boys, transistor radios
Blasting their treble tones
And the arguments are disputed after school,
In the parking lot as the teachers bend the rules.

Patiently you waited for a courting boy's embrace,
Then everyone would know.
But the letter jacket wasn't yours to own
And it proves to be on temporary loan.

And as they all grow older the truth will be understood,
'Cause we never turn out the way we thought we would."

He was uncomplaining as a tree
Not a thing like me

You're not a teenager
So don't act like one
Sure she is a heartbreaker
Does she have one?
Is it down to me, down to me?

I didn't have you down for being easily led

Scared of what's behind you and scared of what's in front
Live with what you have
Now I make the best of what's to come

Tell me a story long and true
We aren't what we say we are what we do
Just pieces of a puzzle to find where we stand just confused
So you are the moon that pulls me through the night

Alone is the street where you found me

Just when we need them

And farther out
There's magic everywhere

Everything that we could be noticing
And really see we can wake

tempest,bob dylan,"The pale moon rose in its glory
Out on the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down

It was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a golden age foretold

The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near

Lights were holding stedy
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home

The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love

The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld

Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind

Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap

He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long

He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep

Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around

The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside

Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull

The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart

Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last

The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done

The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty five degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees

Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside

Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?

His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene

The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere

Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side

Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers

The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
It'd be the last trip of his life

Calvin, Blake and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale on the disembark

Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance

They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks

The bishop left his cabin
To help others in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, ""The poor are yours to feed""

Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world

Jim Dandy smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him

He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace

They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold

Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had

He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm

Petals fell from flowers
'Til all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on

The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go

There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before

The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone

The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel

He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he'd lost the race

In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears

When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best

They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
On the judgment of God's hand

The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
Love had lost its fires
All things had run their course

The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea"

You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly"

What up, love? I need a hug cause drugs be takin' over
Shorty couldn't take it no more, she went loca
No stranger to a rum and soda
I met the ho while she was slumped over
Shit, I've been good, though, I can't complain
I could probably cop a half a plane
Drinking juice just like Jack LaLanne now
I'mma strike it rich any day now
Uh, you know I gotta get a plate now
Virtuoso on a keyboard
I rep the eastern seaboard, jeez Lord
Please leave the Z3 keys before you leave
Don't sneeze on my shit, cause for shiz I'mma flip ya
Pedicured foot slide in the slipper
Tryna do the remix with Pitbull
Tell the pilot land at Schiphol
Play the violin with dimples
Life's ironic and it's simple
Smoke good, fuck, eat, drink
Drive nice car, wear all green mink
First time I whacked off was a Penthouse
Roses in the bath at the penthouse
Billy Joel at the garden
Should I get a skybox or an '89 iroc?
It's always poppin' at the iHop
Choke a pussy with his tie knot, it's my block
Chuck Knoblauch, spicey coconut curry from the Thai spot
I'm in a hurry, dumb jewelry
The verdict read from a hung jury
The doctor said that I was hung early
Skull curly, Larry, and Moe, I'll marry a ho
Only if the bitch look like Mari' Monroe
Twisted off the Jenkem, watching Iron Chef
The secret ingredient was lion's neck
Royal Blue-Cyber Tech
I ride solo like a fighter jet
Hurt me again

No, don't hurt me again
Please, don't hurt me again
No, don't hurt me again
There's no hit records on a demo
There's no hit records on a demo
No, don't hurt me again
There's no hit records on a demo
There's no hit records on a demo

Catch me hoppin' out the limo

testify,melissa etheridge,"Morning's hard coffee's cold
Pretending that the days mean more than getting old
Stale headlines others drenched in pride
Marching to their drum with fear standing beside
But if I close my eyes and throw back my head
I can see his face and I hear the words he said
And my memories ache and my senses burn
Did he dream too late will we ever learn

CHORUS
I, I want to testify
My love still lives and breathes
And my soul is screaming why
The thoughts won't let me sleep
Don't let hearts break
And don't let children cry
Before it gets too late
I want to testify

I take what's said as my daily bread
I turn the page and I turn my head
I pick I choose on the evening news
Cause by cause they fight and one by one they lose
Must I live my days in these concrete ways
Will the fire break through this smoky haze
And I swear tonight I'm gonna find that place
It's not the love that dies but the understanding ways

CHORUS

Rip through the wire that screens in my window
Throw open the shade that covers my mind
I'm going to touch I've got to believe
The bell tolls for me

CHORUS"
thank you,chris cornell,"If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
If mountains crumble to the sea, there would still be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain, whispers of the pain
Of tears of loves lost in the days gone by
Our love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall roll until we die

Inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration, look and see

And so today, my world it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the miles
And thanks to you it will be done, for you to me are the only one

Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I am glad

Little drops of rain, whispers of the pain
Of tears of loves lost in the days gone by
Our love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall roll until we die

If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
If mountains crumble to the sea, there would still be you and me"

You drove your car in the sea
Looking for something to believe
I had no time to refuse a feeling
Thankful all my friends with remorse
Thankful all my friends with remorse
Should this start all over again
When there's nothing I can defend
You save the cards I will never send
Thankful all my friends with remorse
I've got no time on my hands
I hope that it won't stay that way
So take your head off ...

What a mess what a marvel
I walked into that cloud again

Craving purity
A fragile mind and a gentle spirit

that lucky old sun,johnny cash,"Up in the mornin', out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay.
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day.

Had a fuss with my woman, an' I toil for my kids,
An' I sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray,
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day.
Oh, Lord above, don't you hear me cryin'
Tears are rollin' down my eyes.
Send in a cloud with a silver linin',
Take me to paradise.
Show me that river, Take me across,
wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day."

And a love whose burning light
Will warm the winter's night

that's the way love is,the temptations,"After bitter tears fall from your eyes
A thousand times, you ask yourself why
The one guy you love has departed, oh yeah
And you're left alone and broken-hearted
Love just comes and goes
How long it's gonna last nobody knows

That's the way
That's the way love is

I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road, girl
And your heart is carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend
And your whole world's cavin' in, listen to me
Now is the time to be strong
You gotta forget him now that he's gone
Remember
That's the way
That's the way love is

Let me run somethin' down to you, baby
Love can be a hurting thing
And it can be as warm as a person's scream
When love is present, everything is alright
But when it's gone you toss and turn all night

The road of love is rough, sometimes
Don't let it get the best of you
Said I've been hurt by love so many times
So I know just what you're goin' through
I bet you wish that you were never born
You've got to forget him, ooh, now that he's gone
Remember

That's the way (love is, baby)
That's the way love is, ooh

Love is here today, gone tomorrow
All your joys turn to sorrow
(That's the way love is)
Ooh, one day gladness, the next day sadness
That's the way love is, sho'nuff, how it is"

if you want it ill write it
you want it ill write it for you
theres a girl and a boy
holding hands
from the bottom of their hearts
now hey now
understand if they dont think about it
where their days have been
on the other side of now
cause they've both been there"
the 59th street bridge song (feelin' groovy),simon & garfunkel,"Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobblestones
Looking for fun and feeling groovy
Ba da-da da-da da-da, feeling groovy
Hello lamppost, what'cha knowing
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain't you got no rhymes for me?
Doo-ait-n-doo-doo, feeling groovy
Ba da-da da-da da-da, feeling groovy
I got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morningtime drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you, all is groovy
Ba da-da da-da da-da
Doo-ait-n-doo-doo, ba-don-dah-don don
Ba da-da da-da da-da
Doo-ait-n-doo-doo, ba-don-dah-don don
Ba da-da da-da da-da dum"
the air that i breathe,k.d. lang,"If I could make a wish, I think I'd pass
Can't think of anything I need
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read

Making love with you has left me peaceful, warm and tired
What else could I ask? there's nothing to be desired

Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep

Sometimes
All I need is the air that I breathe and to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe and to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe

Making love with you has left me peaceful, warm and tired
What more could I ask, there's nothing to be desired

Sometimes
All I need is the air that I breathe and to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe and to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe

Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep

Sleep, silent angel, go to sleep"
the analyst,delta goodrem,"Prepare yourself to meet
A girl who cannot sleep
Dividing every question 'til
The questions are complete
Every twisted tongue
She studies everyone
She won't leave any stone unturned
The night is oh so young

Oh, oh
She's traveling back in time
Questioning every line
That someone said
Oh, oh
She's trying to understand

Free her mind
She's always the analyst
Silent space
The culprit
The catalyst
Trying to make sense of her life
Digging around in the dirt
She's a slave to the work
She's always the analyst

Can you be sure we haven't met?
See the eyes
They don't forget
They wander through the passageways
That tease a restless mind
Can't afford to slip
The picture's gotta fit
Her world's a photograph
That gets dissected bit by bit

Oh, oh
She's traveling back in time
Questioning every line
That someone said
Oh, oh
She's trying to understand

Free her mind
She's always the analyst
Silent space
The culprit
The catalyst
Trying to make sense of her life
Digging around in the dirt
She's a slave to the work
She's always the analyst

She's always the analyst
Oh, oh

Reliving
The mistake she's made
Not a moment for
The curious girl

Free her mind
She's always the analyst
Silent space
The culprit
The catalyst
Trying to make sense of her life

Digging around
Breaking it down
Neurotic thoughts
Burning the ground
Every sight
Every sound
She's always the analyst"
the angel,bruce springsteen,"The angel rides with hunchback children
Poison oozing from his engine
Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon
On his way to hubcap heaven

Baseball cards poked in his spokes
His boots in oil, he's patiently soaked
The roadside attendant nervously jokes
As the angel's tires strokes his precious pavement

Well, the interstate's choked with nomadic hordes
In Volkswagen vans with full running boards dragging great anchors
Followin' dead end signs into the sores
The angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore

Madison Avenue's claim to fame
In a trainer bra with eyes like rain
She rubs against the weather-beaten frame
And asks the angel for his name

Off in the distance the marble dome
Reflects across the flatlands
With a naked feel off into parts unknown
The woman strokes his polished chrome
And lies beside the angel's bones"
the antidote,st. vincent,"I am the antidote
I’ll suck your venom out
Show me where it really hurts
I’ll show you where it really hurts
Should’ve stopped for the wind
Should’ve stopped for love
Should’ve stopped for the wind
Should’ve stopped for love
Honey, your clothes are soaked
Mom leaves my daddy’s trapes
Show me where it really hurts
I’ll show you where it really hurts
Should’ve stopped for the wind
Should’ve stopped for love
Should’ve stopped for the wind
Should’ve stopped for love
Should’ve stopped for the wind
Should’ve stopped for love

the beach,dr. dog,"There's a hole in the roof, and the rain's comin' down
The roads are all flooded, there's no way back to town
And this ship we came in on, has just run aground
You know fate has a funny way of comin' around

The memories we've buried, have now taken seed
When spring time comes they'll turn into weeds
And they'll creep through your window to smother your dreams
You know fate has a funny way of comin' around

Oh they'll carve our names like scripture
To the souls of their feet
Every footprint that they take
It will tell of our deed

Drowning lies, oh they're following me
Till the flow tide comes, to swallow
The beach

This bottle of bourbon's now dry as a bone
It drank us all up and then it left us alone
Well we sense whats to come, but we can't choke it down
You know fate has a funny way of coming around"
the beast,austra,"The morning that I was born again
I was made into a beast
Am I free now, am I at peace?
Is that the ground below me or your feet?

The morning I saw your face again
I was made into a beast
Am I free now, am I at peace?
Is that the ground below me or your feet?

And I'll break my head over you this way"
the beautiful ones,poets of the fall,"Flies with a broken wing, she's ever so graceful, so like an angel
But I see, tears flow quietly.

The struggle she's seen this spring, when nothing comes dancing
Paying a handsome fee, and still she smiles at me.

And I can't take it, no I can't help but wonder...

Why do we sacrifice the beautiful ones?
How do you break a heart of gold?
Why do we sacrifice our beautiful souls?
Heroes of tales unsung, untold.

Sweet as an angel sings, she gives though she has none left but the
Last one, free, unhesitatingly.

And I am humbled, I am a broken mirror, and I can't help but wonder...

Why do we sacrifice the beautiful ones?
How do you break a heart of gold?
Why do we sacrifice our beautiful souls?
Heroes of tales unsung, untold.

Why do we sacrifice the beautiful ones?
Why when they walk with love alone?
Why do we sacrifice our beautiful souls?
Just trying to find their way home.

Why do we sacrifice the beautiful ones?
How do you break a heart of gold?
Why do we sacrifice our beautiful souls?
Heroes of tales unsung, untold.
Why do we sacrifice the beautiful ones?
Why when they walk with love alone?
Why do we sacrifice our beautiful souls?
Just trying to find their way home."
the bed,lou reed,"This is the place where she lay her head
When she went to bed at night
And this is the place our children were conceived
Candles lit the room brightly at night
And this is the place where she cut her wrists
That odd and fateful night
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
This is the place where we used to live
I paid for it with love and blood
And these are the boxes that she kept on the shelf
Filled with her poetry and stuff
And this is the room where she took the razor
And cut her wrists that strange and fateful night
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
I never would have started if I'd known
That it's end this way
But funny thing, I'm not at all sad
That it stopped this way
Stopped this way"
the best thing,electric youth,"I mean usher is this what it come to man
This is how we gon' do it
I mean I making grass grow baby, ya know
Seeds become plants
Boys become men
Want we gon' do
Wrapped around our girls like pashminas
Whats my demeanor
The grass is always greener on the other side
To think of I cant give her a ring up
I couldn't give a fuck
I could I give a finger
Let alone half baths and closets
So claustrophobic if there were close objects
Now its sort of like two door garages
Its like two broads minagin'
Your the best mama!
Is there any chance
That you remember me being any more than just a horrible man
And would you consider
Pullin' this trigger
And taking a second shot at romance
Oh Babe
I want the days when you were my girl
And I was your man
Know I took you for granted
But it wasn't until now I see how much I miss you
Girl I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool, yeah
But for once, here goes the truth
I can't be fake I can't be phonie
Acting all hard thats the niggas thats lonely
I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing
The best things that ever happened to me
You took my best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing that I ever seen
You took the, the best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress cause when you left you took the very best
Remember Mimi or Vita, remember Isha or Eva
I ain't got em no more, hey yes
Niomi or Jenny, the same outcome is chillin'
Girl, I let em all go
No more trickin' and kissin' miscellaneous chicks
Acting like a jerk, woman I been to church
And I talked to the bishop and he wanted me to share this with ya
How much I miss you
I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once here goes the truth
I can't be fake I can't be phonie
Acting all hard thats the niggas thats lonely
I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing

Mama tried to told me
Hovie Hov better slow it down
You gon' lose your best thing
If you keep gettin' round

Ma forever young was forever numb
Sorry states are sorry done
Your million and all of them
All of em was funny time
It wasn't you it was him
School me once school me twice
Three times and I was dumb
Now its so plant the seed in me

the big sleep,murder by death,"At the end of the road he calls everyone home
And the fire will consume us striking through to the bone
At the end of the road you will soon hear him call
As the congregations crumble and the chapels will fall
And the taste on your tongue well it comes yeah it comes
With the bittersweet pang of remorse and pain
Till the judgement is made the prosecutions won

The gavel has fall and justice is done
The courtroom clears, I'm left alone on the bench
My wife and children gone, along with the defense
The bailiff leads me back to my cell
Like the riverman ferrying my to hell

I can't blame them, no, to hate me for what I've done
I hear them whisperin' in the hall
You'll live and die by the gun
All I can do is sit here and pray
I'll be forgiven on judgement day

Tell my wife in our yard burried underneath the pine
There's a shoebox full of money
Of which I've never earned a dime
Use it to start over the way things should have been
Live honest and love again

Tell my wife tell my kids I never meant for this to happen
When they flip the switch please do not stay
I couldn't bear for you to remember me this way"
the biggest lie,elliott smith,"I'm waiting for the train
Subway that only goes one way
The stupid thing that'll come to pull us apart
And make everybody late
You spent everything you had
Wanted everything to stop that bad
Now I'm a crashed credit card registered to Smith -
Not the name that you called me with
You turned white like a saint
I'm tired of dancing on a pot of gold-flaked paint
Oh we're so very precious, you and I
And everything that you do makes me want to die
Oh I just told the biggest lie
I just told the biggest lie
The biggest lie"
the birds,elbow,"The birds, are the keepers of our secret
As they saw us where we lay
In the deepest grass of springtime
In a reckless guilty haze

And they wove a sweet indifference
And it settled on our skin
Till the eyes that I remember
For the last time drew me in

The birds, though I wore your glacial patience
To a smudge of bitter dust
On the last day you embraced me
With a glistening sapling trust

Did they sing a million blessings
As they watched us slowly part?
Do they keep those final kisses
In their tiny racing hearts

What are we gonna do with you?
Same tale every time
What are we gonna do with you?
Come on inside
Looking back is for the birds

What are we gonna do with you?
Same tale every time
What are we gonna do with you?
Come on inside
Looking back is for the birds

What are we gonna do with you?
Same tale every time
What are we gonna do with you?
Come on inside
Looking back is for the birds

What are we gonna do with you?
Same tale every time
What are we gonna do with you?
Come on inside
Looking back is for the birds"
the body,the pains of being pure at heart,"Come on now stop staring at the ceiling
Your last daydream is slowly unreeling
Won't you come out tonight, like I know you want to
Cuz the city's alive and even though it haunts you, I want you

To tell me again what the body's for
Cuz I can't feel it anymore
I want to hurt like it did before
We shouldn't sin

Tell me again what the body's for
Cuz I can't feel it anymore
I lost mine and I need yours,
It's only skin, we could swim

You try so hard to keep it together,
And you look so hard in fishnets and leather
But I know who you are, you are just a lost saint
And if we go too far, there'll be heaven to pay
And what a price...

I can't feel it anymore, tell me again what the body's for
I can't feel it anymore, tell me again it's only skin, we should swim"

the boxer,simon & garfunkel,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie-lie

Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie-lie

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me, going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains

Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie

the boy next door,lisa ekdahl,"(H.Martin-R.Blane)

How can I ignore
The boy next door?
I love him more than I can say.
Doesn't try to please me, doesn't even tease me,
And he never sees me glance his way.

And though I'm heart-sore
The boy next door affection for me won't display,
I just adore him, so I can't ignore him,
The boy next door.

I just adore him, so I can't ignore him,
The boy next door."
the breakup song,greg kihn band,"And we had broken up for good just an hour before
(Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancin' 'cross the floor
(Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
And then the band slowed the tempo and the music gets you down
(Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
It was the same old song with a melancholy sound
(Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)

They don't write 'em like that anymore

They just don't write 'em like that anymore

We'd been living together for a million years
(Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
But now it feels so strange out in the atmospheres
(Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
And then the jukebox plays a song I used to know
(Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancin' so slow
(Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)

They don't write 'em like that anymore
They don't write 'em like that anymore

Now I wind up staring at an empty glass
(Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
'Cause it's so easy to say that you'll forget your past

They don't write 'em like that anymore
No
They just don't write 'em like that anymore
They don't write 'em like that anymore

They just don't"
the build up,kimbra,"Went from cities to touch the suburbs
On the highway, but I'm barefoot
I need a map but not the destination
Need a compass but not a conversation

I want to run far from this grey town
You're on every street, marked on the ground
Not the meant and not the paint
Want the price but not the raise

I want the jump but not the height
Let me fall but catch me mid flight
I swam with sharks and beasts of the sea
Only went down for the company
Went down for the company

I forgot to mention:
That you would come back home when I call
Left no sign, nothing at all
Sorry you won't fit inside my heart
I wanted love without the build up

I need the rules but not the regulations
Want the wisdom but not the information
Need the light but not the heat of the day
Need your hands to show me how to pray

I lost the plot underneath the fire
Of all the dots and lines that took me higher
Away from traffic and smiles of tire
I like the nights but not the tangled wires

Need the pulse to feel alive
All the world's just made it seem all quiet
This has all become far too loud
I like you more when you don't make a sound

You will come back home when I call
Left no sign, nothing at all
Sorry you won't fit inside my heart
Won't you come light the way and wash this away

I wanted love without the build up"

Against your heart
Living like you're dying
So far from the sun

Waiting for a guardian angel
To lead you through the dangers
That lie ahead on your way
Towards tomorrows arms

Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days
You're hiding yourself away
From our cruel world's embrace
And as your days turn to weeks
You will cry yourself to sleep
In the cage...

We all have our fears but yours are the scariest of them all
Lift your head and let us taste
The horror you adore

And it all starts to make sense
All the blood wisely shed
Just wait until the cure comes knocking on your door

Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days
You're hiding yourself away
From our cruel world's embrace
And as your days turn to weeks
You will cry yourself to sleep
In the cage you're locked in

Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days
You're hiding yourself away
From our cruel world's embrace
And as your days turn to weeks
You will cry yourself to sleep
In the cage...

And as your days turn to weeks

In the cage you've locked yourself in"

Cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two

Soak it in the sun and make a groovy lemon pie

He mixes it with love, makes the world taste good

The candy man makes everything he makes

Talking about your childhood for the wishes

But delicious.

Who can take tomorrow, dip it in a dream
Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream

the change,evanescence,"Thought that I was strong
I know the words I need to say

Yes it's over
But I need you anyway

Never meant to lie

The more that I am with you
The more that I am all alone

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

Say it's over
Yes it's over

Not that I'm so different
Not that I don't see
The dying light of what we used to be
But how could I forgive you?
You've changed!
And I'm a liar by your side
I'm about to lose my mind

'Cause I've been screaming on the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

You've been dreaming
If you're thinking

Old women grow bitter, don't let that happen to you.""

Why can't I grow up with dignity? Set me free""

Once upon a time you never criticised me.
Oh, I much preferred you as a child.""

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir,
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe,
Help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow,
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.
They know that Santa's on his way;
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh.
And every mother's child is gone spy,
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.
And so I'm offering this simple phrase,
For kids from one to ninety-two,
Although its been said many times, many ways,
Merry Christmas to you.

I hate to see you cry
But when you open up to me
I take you in my arms
Wish you the top, top, top, top of the morning

No, I don't care about cash or careers
Your losses or your arrears
I take you in my arms

Wish you the top, top, top, top of the morning

No I won't let this city destroy us
Won't let the city destroy our love

Let me shed some light on your dark
Help you see
How darling you've left your mark

On my life
And the beautiful all around
When I see you, top, top, top, top of the morning

I was lost
Until that night we kissed
Give it up

A life, oh darling, not this
You want more
Than the hell this city lets you down
When I see you, top, top, top, top of the morning

I won't let the city destroy our love

No, no, no, no

Not about the debts you made
The car we never had
The house we never owned
Darling don't look so sad
It's about that day we kissed
Down by Niagara Falls

It's about the keys, the keys, the keys to my heart you hold
Top, top, top, top of the morning now
Won't let the city destroy our love
Won't let the city destroy my love
Won't let no mistake take the roof from off our heads

the clearing,arab strap,"Oh, she always used to be the same
She'd be loose with a straight dark facial frame
And now the things that used to turn me off
I find endearing
And they laugh behind the trees
As she lies naked in the clearing

I adore her, but I ignore her
See, I know it won't last
As I reflect upon my past
But on severance she made no difference

There's things I won't let her know
As we're perfecting our show
I want to own her, I think I'll phone her
I can't explore her if I ignore her

And now the things that used to turn me off
I find endearing
And they laugh behind the trees
As she lies naked in the clearing

But she won't beckon is what I reckon
She may adore me but she'll ignore me
Put them on a show there, we're getting nowhere
She helps my snoring, so it never get's boring

And she always used to be the same
She'd be loose with with a straight dark facial frame
And now the things that used to turn me off
I find endearing
And they laugh behind the trees
As she lies naked in the clearing

I was awake, I overheard your speech
My ego dried and sank
Talked with your ex and we agreed
Thoughts of your sister helped us wank

I'm sure you know that I have fancied her
Since she began high school
But park here now and I will promise
I will let your engine cool"

Something's on your mind
Listen to no other

They'll never see us
I'll wait here you call

Trying to address the people
That you don't care about anymore
When the future's banging on
The door

It's a funny idea
Trying to caress the people
That you don't care about anymore
Is it simpler to ignore?

Is there something new that I could bring

I just want to rise above

the cure,attila,"JEALOUSY IS A MOTHERFUCKIN' BITCH AND SO ARE YOU.
I hear you talkin and I don't know what to think about it.
Yesterday was cool we were hanging at a kickback.
Just because the table's turned now you turn you fuckin back.
Cowardly as fuck just like smokin fuckin crack.
Now we at the top and you still don't get it.
Basic fucking bitches all around don't sweat it.
I'm just sittin cool catchin looks from your bitch.
And she just sent me a text that says you got a small dick.

Cunt.
Go and cry about a bitch and write another little whiny fucking song about me.
Never gave a fuck and never will did you expect less
I just kick back under the shade of my money tree.
Everything I say makes a motherfucking headline.
I can't even breathe without them talkin bout me that's fine.
I'd rather suck it up and stay humble never jealous.
Because jealousy's for fuck boys and you will never get it.

FUCK YEAH
Everybody's having a good time.
But you don't get it and you worry bout the small shit but I don't sweat it nah.
Rolling around on the brink of confusion.
Stuck within your mind you find that you're in a bind with time just like an identity crisis.

Your jealousy's a disease. And my fist is the cure.

Shut the fuck up cunt.

FUCK YEAH
Everybody's having a good time.
But you don't get it and you worry bout the small shit but I don't sweat it nah.
Rolling around on the brink of confusion.
Stuck within your mind you find that you're in a bind with time just like an identity crisis.

I hear you talking in your sleep. And you still. Remember. My fucking. Name.

Your jealousy's a disease. And my fist is the cure.

You're a jealous cunt little bitch run and hide.

JEALOUSY IS A MOTHERFUCKIN' BITCH AND SO ARE YOU.

Shut the fuck up cunt.

I'm getting too old for this middle school shit.
Grown ass men acting like a little bitch.
Take me back in time somebody hit rewind to the days where music mattered drama didn't fly.
Schoolboy bitches didn't get a fuckin mic.
Nobody was judged about the music that they like.
The scene was a family and everyone was happy.
Just to be an individual and not a jealous asshole."
the curse,agnes obel,"And the people went into their hide, ay-oh
From the start they didn't know exactly why, why
Winter came and made it so all look alike, look alike
Underneath the grass would grow, aiming at the sky

It was swift, it was just another wave of a miracle
But no one, nothing at all would go for the kill
If they called on every soul in the land, on the moon
Only then would they know a blessing in disguise

The curse ruled from the underground, down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live unlike before
The curse ruled from the underground, down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live unlike before

Tell me now of the very soul that look alike, look alike
Do you know the stranglehold covering their eyes?
If I call on every soul in the land, on the moon
Tell me if I'll ever know a blessing in disguise

The curse ruled from the underground, down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live unlike before
And the curse ruled from the underground, down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live unlike before"
the dancer,ane brun,"He came riding fast like a phoenix out of fire flames
He came dressed in black with a cross bearing my name
He came bathed in light and the splendor and glory
I can't believe what the Lord has finally sent me

He said, ""Dance for me, fanciulla gentile""
He said, ""Laugh awhile, I can make your heart feel""
He said, ""Fly with me, touch the face of the true God
And then cry with joy at the depth of my love""

'Cause I've prayed days, I've prayed nights
For the Lord just to send me home some sign
I've looked long, I've looked far
To bring peace to my black and empty heart

My love will stay 'til the river bed run dry
And my love lasts long as the sunshine blue sky
I love him longer as each damn day goes
The man is gone and heaven only knows

'Cause I've cried days, I've cried nights
For the Lord just to send me home some sign
Is he near, is he far?
Bring peace to my black and empty heart

So long day, so long night
Oh Lord, be near me tonight
Is he near, is he far?
Bring peace to my black and empty heart"
the dance,barbie's cradle,"Would you be interested in dancing with me?
And maybe tell me all your dreams
Talk to me like you would in your sleep
Don't censor anything
Cause i wanna hear everything
There's no innocence left to spoil
You can swear she's not a little boy
We'll fly tonight so far away
Where they will never find us
Use your wings and i will run fast
Cause that's what i do when i'm not afraid
We've got it made up in our heads
We don't have to wait for anyone or anything
Go anywhere we desire
So close your eyes become blind
From the world listen instead to the girl
She'll tell you why she chose to fly
And you're left behind
Just like me alone and free
We can smile when we've filled the void
And treated the burn
But until then i believe
We're gonna have to learn
To discard any disguise we're using
Yes it's hard and it's never amusing"
the darkness,zombie girl,"All alone, flesh and bone,
Evil carved in stone smell the fear
Somewhere up in these hills
Awaits the darkest chills

Can you hear?

Where are you gonna go?
There's nowhere to go now
Trapped in this world,
You're lost forever

There's nobody here to save you
There's nobody near to hear you
There's nobody here to save you
There's nobody near to hear you

In this place, in this time and space
Fear, hate, and evil awaits you
Soon the siren will reign,
Better run from the pain
Before the darkness will eat you

Go, go, get away now
Go, go, run away now
Go, go, get away now
Go, go, go

Where are you gonna go?
There's nowhere to go now
Trapped in this world,
You're lost forever

There's nobody here to save you
There's nobody near to hear you
There's nobody here to save you
There's nobody near to hear you

There's nobody here to save you
There's nobody near to hear you
There's nobody here to save you
There's nobody near to hear you"
the days,patrick wolf,"The days
Passing days
I see the steeple
And trace to the spire
And the sun set
Deep in regret
Phoenix in final fire
And the time stops
Rush hour traffic slows
And my heart starts
Beating this dark
Through old flesh and cold bones
And I long to be carried on
Just once to be lifted strong
Out of the loneliness
And the emptiness
Of the days
Days
Passing days
Days
I remember I had your love once
Seized my body whole
And in our first dance
I thought by chance
God had matched my soul
But time brought its travelling
This distance and solitude
And in that travelling
My self damaging
I took my love far, far from you
But don't you
Still long to be carried on
Once more I could lift you strong
Out of the loneliness
And the emptiness
Of the days
Passing days
Passing days
Days
Tell me
Have we gone too far?
Or did we get too close?
You've no father
I've no son
But when we come ghost
I promise I will meet you
I will meet you
At the end of the days
The days
Passing days
Won't you meet me at the end of the days?"
the distance,a,"If I had a chance, I'd take it faster than a heart beat
If I caught a glance, I'd run to you like nobody was watching

But it's so hard to get to you cause when you see the sun, I see the moon
Buckets of water, millions of clouds, miles of road just to get where are you
Oh I wish It wasn't so far
Thousands of dollars just to be near

Countless thoughts of you being here
Oh I wish it wasn't so hard

But maybe one day we can break the distance
I know it's hard, for everyone to understand it
But you're in my heart, even though it feels like we got stranded
And I wish I could get to you see face to face without a screen cutting through
Buckets of water, millions of clouds, miles of road just to get where are you

Oh I wish It wasn't so far
Thousands of dollars just to be near
Countless thoughts of you being here

Oh I wish it wasn't so hard
But maybe one day we can break the distance

Clouds will you please help me out, I need to go and see them now
Pick me up off my feet, I know that it's crazy, but I am ready with my suitcase by me
Clouds will you please help me out, I need to go and see them now
Pick me up off my feet, I know that it's crazy, but I am ready with my suitcase by me

And you will never understand
The lengths I go to light your way

See, left behind on my own
I have the ghosts of autumn murders walk me home
See the girl on the shore
It's my ideal, nothing more

It's getting darker
And I'm still swimming
It hits me again
The sun is sinking,
Pale blue salt-water breathing
It hits me again

And I am never frightened
No, I am never afraid
And you will never understand
The depths I sink to light your way

See the ghost on the shore

the divide,the legendary pink dots,"I was brushing my teeth when the power went down. You kow, you can't be prepared for that. That electric toothbrush just ceased functioning and I didn't have a clue. I tried a manual spin in my mouth, but hell, it was early. And my fingers just weren't fast enough I grabbed the soap - both hands. Bit it as if it was a burger. But it was disgusting and pointless as the essence of last night's excesses were still there. Decided on a strong coffee to disguise that lingering taste. But of course the coffee machine was dead. And sure, I felt kind of pathetic, but I decided to call the housekeeper on my mobile. As I had no idea of how to change a fuse The phone said: ""Battery empty, please recharge"". Great! It was time to get the hell out of this apartment I punched in the exit code. Five, six, seven times. Nothing happened. I pounded - Just pounded on that reinforced, heavily-padded, soundproofed Front door of mine. And wondered if it was just me. Of course it was just me! I found out at around 9pm that I wasn't alone when the first light went off in the great glass tower across the divide 9pm - Monday night. Normally the time to switch off that computer Order in Malay Kofta, samosas, a carton of wine. Put the feet up. Read a book. I know you're laughing. But I still firmly believe that technology isn't everything. Instead, I found myself stumbling around on borrowed illumination. I found half a packet of crackers left by my last girlfriend a few weeks ago. And ate them - slowly. Then I just curled up on the couch. And of course I slept badly. Now I mark the days. Much like a castaway on a raft on the open sea. Little blue lines on the wall with that antique ball-point pen. But it's drying out now. But I've given up the shouting. I've given up the pummeling because it's pointless. I've tried to establish a routine. I even tidied up the place with my bare hands. But it's not gonna be long now - The last thing I did before the power failed was to command the bank to make all of my regular payments automatically. On an appointed date. You see, I didn't want them to come looking for me. I'm reasonably wealthy. I will not be saved by the bill. I really hope you appreciate the humour I'm showing at this rather inappropriate moment. Lately, I've been wondering if any of my networking friends and acquaintances miss me. Frankly, I doubt it. Sure, I'm decent company. I spin the odd, inspired one-liner. I'm amusing, but face it - Hardly essential. And I know what you're thinking. It looks bad, doesn't it? But you don't have to worry. Understand that I have accepted my fate. None of us - not even you - will go on forever. And well, look - I have a shelf packed with books."

Take me down to the water, Oh,
When the day has bled to night.

Give me my sickle and broom, Oh,
And tie my hands to the stake,
Sally me down to the river, Oh,
And take what you're eager to take.

Burn me and beat me and hold back my arms
Still the sun hides its face from me
And when the summer is gone, Oh,
I'll come flying back out of the sea.

Drown me down in the cold tide, Oh,
Hold back my hair from the waves,
And when I breathe my last, Oh,
Bless my bones in their greenwater grave.

Better than not at all
I'll tell you what i mean
Got a damn
Spaceman right here in me
And it likes it all
Something's taken over me but i like to brawl
Better than faking independence
Just take the fall
Some of 'em jump the cab before they leave it to go through the wall

Hey now nobody can stop at all
So how am i gonna take the fall
When endless dreams keep coming in
I might take it all

I'm just saying i just don't know
That the pain it means
That i really do know
If your body just wants to run
Let your fingers break the bow
It's better to take the fall
And then go sing that desert song

Hey now
Nobody can stop at all
So how am i gonna take the fall
When endless streams keep coming in
Some might take it all wrong

Some of them tearing things up
Some of them like to crawl
Some of them conversations they don't go nowhere at all
Some of them make a pit stop never get back to the hall
Some of them culminations never stop

the fear,pulp,"This is our music from the bachelor's den;
The sound of lonliness turned up to ten;
A horror soundtrack, from a stagnant waterbed
And it sounds just like this

This is the sound of someone losing the plot
Making out that they're ok when they're not
You're gonna like it but not a lot
And the chorus goes like this

Oh baby here comes the fear again
The end is near again
A monkey's built a house on your back;
You can't get anyone to come in the sack
And here comes another panic attack oh
Here we go again

So now you know the words to my song
Pretty soon you'll all be singing along
When you're sad when you're lonely and it all turns out wrong
When you've got the fear

And when you're no longer searching for beauty or love
Just some kind of life with the edges taken off
When you can't even define what it is that you are frightened of
This song will be here

Oh baby here comes the fear again
The end is near again

If you ever get that chimp off your back
If you ever find the thing that you lack
Oh you know you're only having a laugh oh
Oh here we go again
Until the end
Until the end"
the figurehead,velvet acid christ,"Sharp and open, leave me alone
And sleeping less every night
As the days become heavier and weighted
Waiting in the cold light

A noise, a scream tears my clothes
As the figurines tighten with spiders inside them
And dust on the lips of a vision of hell
I laughed in the mirror for the first time in a year

A hundred other words blind me with your purity
Like an old painted doll in the throes of dance
I think about tomorrow, please, let me sleep
As I slip down the window, freshly squashed fly
You mean nothing, you mean nothing

I can lose myself in Chinese art and American girls
All the time lose me in the dark
Please do it right, run into the night
I will lose myself tomorrow, crimson pain
My heart explodes, my memory in a fire
And someone will listen at least for a short while

I can never say no to anyone but you

Too many secrets, too many lies
Writhing with hatred, too many secrets
Please make it good tonight
But the same image haunts me
In sequence, in despair of time

I will never be clean again
I touched her eyes
Pressed my stained face
I will never be clean again

Touch her eyes
Press my stained face
I will never be clean again"

Fire, you're on your own, your pretty eyes have seen enough.
We'll go higher where I belong, the city lights are bright enough, to blind me.
And you, the look we choose, I feel like the latest news.
It's all bruised, it's up to you. Oh can't you feel my heart beat?

the first time ever i saw your face,leona lewis,"The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies

And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That must stay at my command, my love

And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy would fill the Earth
And last and last and last
'Til the end of time, my love

The first time ever I saw your face, your face
Your face, your face"

I pick it up

If I let you go
You slip into the fog

This love of yours is big enough to be frightened of

The day I learned to swim

""Just put your feet down, child
The water is only waist high

We're in a different war
With ourselves, and with some of you
So many things that don't hold true

With the fear that dims our light
With the barnacles on our right

On the grass, beachy head
On the cliff to which you've been lead
The curve of the hill is green and soft
As if the wind would hold you aloft

Its how you feel for me now, not how you felt
Its how you deal with envy, not how you dealt

Recognise and send away, set it asail
Serenity inside of me

We're in a different war
With ourselves, and with some of you
So many things that can't be true

On the grassy beachy head
On the cliff where you were laid
The curve, the hill is green and soft
As if the wind would hold you

Serenity inside of me
Set asail

But you'll sail alone
If you don't hold the rope
You'll go alone"
the game,echo & the bunnymen,"A sense of duty
Was my one intention
And an ugly beauty
Was my own invention
Pride a proud refusal
And I refuse
To need your approval
Too many seekers
Too few beacons
But through the fog
We'll keep on beaming

Through the crying hours
Of your glitter years
All the living out
Of your tinsel tears
And the midnight trains
I never made
'Cause I'd already
Played... the game

Everybody's
Got their own good reason
Why their favorite season
Is their favorite season
Winter winners
And those summer sons
Aren't good for everyone
Aren't good for everyone
Spring has sprung
And autumn's well done
So well done

And it's a better thing
That we do now
Forgetting everything
The whys and hows
While you reminisce
About the things you miss
You won't be ready
To kiss... goodbye

The earth is a world
The world is a ball
A ball in a game
With no rules at all
And just as I wonder
At the beauty of it all
You go and drop it
And it breaks and falls

I'll never understand
Why you thought I would
Need to be reassured
And be understood
When I always knew
That your bad's my good
And I was ready
Ready... to be loved

Born under Mars
With Jupiter rising
Fallen from stars
That lit my horizon

I'll never understand
Why you thought I would
Need to be reassured
And be understood
When I always knew
That your bad's my good
And I was ready
Ready... to be

Through the crying hours
Of your glitter years
All the living out
Of your tinsel tears
And the midnight trains
I never made
'Cause I'd already
Played

It's a better thing
That we do now
Forgetting everything
The whys and hows
While you reminisce
About the things you miss
You won't be ready
To kiss... goodbye"

If only to pass the time
I love you for all your weakness
I love you for all your lies

Will you grow
Will you understand
The damage you caused in time?
The past is behind we are facing
A punishment for the crime

The gift you gave me
Our sweet encounter
Became so fragile and flew with the night
I will be witness
I will not falter
'Til we are risen again to the light

Would you forgive me
My heart was broken
But I will mend, I will be as before
Just give me one chance
To make it better
Ooh, let me be yours (let me be yours)

Without you I'm weak and I'm useless
Without you I find I'm blind
I watch you alone, are you dreaming
Of happiness left behind?

Do you drift in your heart at night?
Walk through the rooms of your mind
Open the door I'll be waiting
Remember this is your life

The gift you gave me
Our sweet encounter
Became so fragile and flew with the night
I will be witness
I will not falter
'Til we are risen again to the light

Would you forgive me? (Would you forgive me?)

Very happy to be here. Please... Please, stop the applause.

She walks through the rain feeling like a bad habit
She calls her own name, such a scared little rabbit
Who's been discarded again like an old rotten carrot
No one would claim
No one would speak at her disposition rattled
By the sound of a snake and her mother side - saddled
By the sadie's estate selling human hair jackets
To the Sons of Dicks

And say awful things like ""Kill both of your parents""

He's got a hare trigger, be careful, he'll pull it
No way that he'll stay locked away he can't do it

Feel the moonlight on your skin

The desert wind
Cool your aching head

The weight of the world
Drift away instead

I don't even try

It's a treacherous road
With a desolated view

There's distant lights
But here they're far and few

Gotta drive all night
Just to feel like you're okay

I can't believe what I see
Tell me, who's that funky dude
Staring back at me?

Broken, beaten down
Can't even get around
Without an old man cane
I fall and hit the ground
Shivering in the cold
I'm bitter and alone

Excuse the bitching
I shouldn't complain
I should have no feeling
Cause feeling is pain

As everything I need
Is denied me
And everything I want
Is taken away from me
But who do I got to blame?
Nobody but me

And I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shaking booty, making sweet love all the night

Ain't gonna cause a scene

Familiar places that we can run and hide
Are filled with strangers
Walking in our houses alone

In the great divide
Nothing to decide
No one else to care for or love
In the great divide

On the horses of the carousel
She rides alone with you and me
She rides like she knows
Wherever she goes, we'll be there

On the carousel
Life is going well
Anyone can tell we're in love
On the carousel
You're gonna like the way you feel

You and I, we got caught down there
In the twisted canyons of the great divide
We walked the floor
Now we don't go there anymore

In the great divide
Nothin' to decide
No one else to care for or love

Looking for the great escape

Far from all the things that we are

And breathes it out, he says
Bye bye, bye to all of the noise
Oh, he says, Bye bye
Bye to all of the noise

Hey child, things are looking down
That's OK, you don't need to win anyways
Don't be afraid, just eat up all the grey
And it will fade all away
Don't let yourself fall down

Bad day

Looking for the great escape
On a bad day
Looking for the great escape

the greatest,cat power,"Once I wanted to be the greatest
No wind or waterfall could stall me
And then came the rush of the flood
Stars at night turned deep to dust
Melt me down
Into big black armour
Leave no trace of grace
Just in your honor
Lower me down
Culprit south
Make 'em wash a space in town
For the lead
And the dregs of my bed
I've been sleeping
Lower me down
Pin me in
Secure the grounds
For the later parade
Once I wanted to be the greatest
Two fists of solid rock
With brains that could explain any feeling
Lower me down
Pin me in
Secure the grounds
For the lead
And the dregs of my bed
I've been sleeping
For the later parade
Once I wanted to be the greatest
No wind or waterfall could stall me
And then came the rush of the flood
The stars at night turned deep to dust"
the guardian,delta goodrem,"I push through the crowd
Without looking back
To leave you behind
Took all that I had
And maybe I'm wrong
I might be sorry

But what kind of fool
Would hope for a change
Then write a new word
On a page that is stained
And ruined by lie?
You shouldn't have told me

I'm the guardian
I am the sole protector
On a heart that's been abused

I won't let love do me in again
I can't just run to the light
Of a fire and jump in
Risk a poisoned kiss just to have
My thirst unquenched again
Let love do me in

I swallow the urge
To call out your name
The need crashes in
I brace for the wave
And pray it will pass
Not take me under

'Cause, I'm the guardian
I am the last defence for
My weakened heart
That still wants you

I won't let love do me in again
I can't just run to the light
Of a fire and jump in
Risk a poisoned kiss just to have
My thirst unquenched again
Let love do me in, oh

I'm the guardian
I am the sole protector
Of a heart that's been abused

I won't let love
Risk a poisoned kiss just to have
Just to have my thirst unquenched again
Let love do me in"

All those mistakes and be wise

The strength inside me burning

But where are you my angel now?
Don't you see me crying?
And I know that you can't do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying

I'm on my knees in front of him
But he doesn't seem to see me
With all his troubles on his mind
He's looking right through me

And I'm letting myself down
By satisfying you
And I wish that you could see
That I have my troubles too

Looking at you sleeping
I'm with the man I know
I'm sitting here weeping
While the hours pass so slow

And I know that in the morning
I'll have to let you go
And you'll be just a man
Once I used to know

But for these past few days
Someone I don't recognize
This isn't all my fault
When will you realize?

I'm looking for a sign"

The last time I saw you
My eyes were red from constant crying
Blue moon was at my door
You read my hand and told me all
Romantics go to heaven
To heaven or to war.

We said too much too soon
I bled and let you pacify my wounded pride.

The last time I saw you
Alone, you shielded me from strangers
And saved me from the Lord
And in my dreams I still have you
You're still my sweet compadre
I your El Gran Señor.

We said too much too soon
I bled and let you pacify my wounded pride.

The last time I saw you
My eyes were red from constant crying
Blue moon was at my door
The leaping of my ransomed heart
Said trees can weep and stone can bleed
We knew but we weren't sure.

We said too much too soon
I bled and let you pacify my wounded pride.

We said too much too soon
I bled and let you pacify my wounded pride."

Walked away,
Heard them say,
Poison hearts will never change
Walk away again
Turned away in disgrace
Felt the chill upon my face
Cooling from within
Hard to notice
Gleaming from the sky
When your staring at the cracks
Hard to notice
What is passing by
With eyes low, Oh
Walked away
Heard them say
Poison hearts will never change
Walk away again
All the cracks they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me
All the cracks they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me
And they'll part
As I

Meant to take away the hurting
As your lonely silhouette
Closes the curtain
We're back on the road destination uncertain
So let's get in this car and drive
And this feeling I feels so strong
So powerful it can't be wrong
Now the whole frosted night is just a song

A song for you
A song for you
A song for you

Now the moon has splashed right over the street
Like my tears on your thighs so pale
There's just you and me in the streets
And the whole wide world feel like a jail

When you're away from me
You're away from me
You're away from me

You turn out the light
And the dark sucks on the embers of the fire
My heart smoulders in the night
And these tumbling boulders of desire

Come rollin'
Come rollin'
Come rollin' out the shadows at me
Come rollin' out the shadows at me

You turn out the light"

Closer to your eyes, get your attention
Before you pass me by

Back up, back up
Take another chance
Don't you mess up, mess up
I don't wanna lose you
Wake up, wake up
This ain't just a thing that you
Give up, give up
Don't you say that I'd be
Better off, better off, sleeping by myself and wondering
If I'm better off, better off, without you boy

And every time you notice me by
Holding me closely and saying sweet things
I don't believe that it could be
You speaking your mind and saying the real thing
My feet have broke free and I am leaving
I'm not gonna stand here feeling lonely but
I don't regret it and I don't think it
Was just a waste of time

Back up, back up
Take another chance
Don't you mess up, mess up
I don't wanna lose you
Wake up, wake up
This ain't just a thing that you
Give up, give up
Don't you say that I'd be
Better off, better off, sleeping by myself and wondering
If I'm better off, better off, without you boy

Don't just leave me hangin' on...
Don't just leave me hangin' on...

The little things you do to me are
Taking me over, I wanna show ya
Everything inside of me
Like a nervous heart that is crazy beatin'
My feet are stuck here against the pavement
I wanna break free, I wanna make it
Closer to your eyes, get your attention
Before you pass me by

Don't just leave me hangin' on...

Back up, back up
Take another chance
Don't you mess up, mess up
I don't wanna lose you
Wake up, wake up
This ain't just a thing that you
Give up, give up
Don't you say that I'd be
Don't just leave me hangin' on...
Don't just leave me hangin' on...
Don't just leave me hangin' on...
Don't just leave me hangin' on...
Don't just leave me hangin' on...
Don't just leave me hangin' on..."
the lonely ones,chris isaak,"If you drive late at night, and pass the town at night.
And know that someone lies awake not sleeping.
If you drive fast at night, and hear the wind at night.
And know tha sometimes you can hear them weeping, the lonely ones.

The lonely ones.

And though you'd like to stop, you know it's wrong to stop.
The nights' to dark for you to ever reach them, the lonely ones.

The lonely ones.

As you drive on we drive faster,
You try to leave the night behind you but wait...
You hear them still... You always will.

The lonely ones.

Out on the edge of town, you start to turn around.
But in your mirror you see the one who is crying, the lonely ones.

The lonely ones, the lone-ly ones!"
the lonely one,wipers,"For all the lonely ones, who live life in the dreams
It's so cold and lonely outside, so it seem's.
So you keep on searching, anyway.
Maybe you'll find someone tomorrow, cuz you haven't today.

So let your mind be carried, with the breeze.
For you know your not the one's who carry, the deseise.
Cuz your the lonely one.
the only one.
the lonely one."
the lonely,molly nilsson,"Smell my fear
Carry me far away from here
Get me running in the street like rain
Not even saints will complain

And you're so pretty to look at
But I don't understand
Oh my god look at
And won't you grab my hand

If only you would hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me now

Only the lonely get out of here and live this life
Only the lonely

Smell my disease
And my impatience are easy to please

I've got everything I need, nothing, not a thing, nothing

Don't be afraid
Of the mess we might have made
It was all supposed to be this way
And ill get up to clean it out one day
Hold me hold me now

Only the lonely get out of here and live this life
Only the lonely

I've got everything I need, nothing, not a thing, nothing"
the long and winding road,paul mccartney,"The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Cried for the day
Don't keep me waiting here
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
But still they lead me back
To the long and winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me standing here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long and winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago... oh yeah
Don't keep me waiting here
Don't keep me waiting
Lead me to your door
Ooh, ooh, ooh"

You gigolo
You know that I
Loved ya hon
And I didn't wanta know
That your cool, seductive serenade
Was a tool of your trade
You gigolo

Of all the riches
You've surveyed
And all that you can lift
I'm just another dollar
That youve made in your long long grift

Look what you've done you gigolo
Another hustle has been run
But now you oughta know
That this fool can no longer be swayed
By the tools of your trade
You gigolo

I'm just another John you gypped
Another sucker stiffed
A walk-on role in the script
Of your long long grift

The love that had me in your grip
Was just a long long grift"
the longest winter,pedro the lion,"Spring comes slowly
To this old friend
Still I'm frozen
And still live alone

In time
Memories fade
Senses numb
One forgets how it feels
To have loved completely

Love well young man
While you still can
Once your leaves turn
You won't love again

In time
Memories fade
Senses numb
One forgets how it feels
To have loved completely
Completely

Is it special when your lonely
Will you spend your whole life
In a studio apartment
With a cat for a wife

The seasons when they call you
Do you baracade the doors
Are you stubborn, stubborn
Stubborn to the core

Is it your way
Or the highway
Is it your way
Or the highway

Is it your way
Or the highway
Is it your way
Or the highway

Then the longest
Winter is on her way
You called her without knowing it
But now it's too late"
the look of love,dusty springfield,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
The look your heart can't disguise
The look of love
Is saying so much more
Than just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight
Let this be just the start
Of so many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
Don't ever go

I love you so"
the lord's prayer,frank sinatra,"Our Father, who art in heaven, hollowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil
For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever.
Amen.

(In the original Latin)
Pater noster qui es in coelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum
Adveniat regnum tuum, fiat voluntas tua, sicut in coelo et in terra
Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittibus debitoribus nostris
Et ne nos in ducas in tentatiomen, sed libera nos a malo.
Amen."
the lottery,johnossi,"Oh brother don't wake me up,
I'll sleep all day, she said
my sister said to me
I hate this town that's laying under me
I agree, I agree with you sister
you know I'd love to go
with you to New York city
but me and Ossi ain't got no money

If I filled the cracks in my ceiling
If would look fine but
There's moisture and mould there behind
I'll bloom like everything always do
But if you take this can of white spray
and just spray all over
we'd hide in your apartment forever
or at least until these stupid thoughts have disiesed

Oh mother you were warm
but yet so cold when
you came home from Italy
and my father he didn't understand
but I understand you both more than you know
so why don't you
why don't you ask me
we all got plans and we all got believes

and I believe that love
soon will come to me
it's building up inside
the precious girl
will win the lottery

If I filled the cracks of my ceiling
it would look fine but
there's moisture and mould there behind
it'll bloom like everything always do

the man i love,dinah shore,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?
And so, all else above,
I'm waiting for the man I love."
the mercy seat,unter null,"It began when they come took me from my home
And put me in Dead Row,
Of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know
And I'll say it again

I am not afraid to die

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields,
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner meals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of truth
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

Interpret signs and catalogue
A blackened tooth, a scarlet fog
The walls are bad Black Bottom kind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath gathering at my hind

I hear stories from the chamber
How Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
Died upon the cross
And might I say it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told

Like my good hand I
tatooed EVIL across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist

In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold
Down here it's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away

Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied

My kill-hand is called EVIL
Wears a wedding band that's GOOD
'Tis a long-suffering shackle
Collaring all that rebel blood

And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this weighing up of truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway there was no proof
Nor a motive why

And the mercy seat is awaiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
to be done with all this measuring of truth
A life for a life and a truth for a truth
And anyway there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this looks of disbelief
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of truth
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way I'm helping
To be done with all this twisted of the truth
A lie for a lie
And a truth for a truth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die"
the message,grand master flash,"It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice

Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause the man with the tow-truck repossessed my car

Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ha-ha-ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

Standing on the front stoop, hangin out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
A crazy lady, livin in a bag
Eating out of garbage piles, used to be a fag-hag

Said, she danced the tango, skipped the light fandango
Was circon princess, seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peepshow, watching all the creeps
So she can tell the stories to the girls back home

She went to the city and got Social Security
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ha-ha-ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

My brothers doin' bad, stole my mothers TV
Says, she watches to much, is just not healthy
""All my children"" in the daytime, ""Dallas"" at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight

The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station

Neon king kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A midrange migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane

Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

My son said, ""daddy, I don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper

I dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey

They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed the arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start

I can't walk through the park, 'cause it's crazy after the dark
Keep my hand on the gun, 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like an outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say you want some more, livin on a seesaw

Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

A child is born, with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you go through

You grow in the ghetto, living second rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The place that you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alley way

You'll admire all the number book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh

Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpockets, peddlers and even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, I'm no fool
But then you wind up dropping out of high school

Now you're unemployed, all null 'n void
Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stickup kid, look what you done did
Got send up for a eight year bid

Now your manhood is took and you're a may tag
Spend the next two years as an undercover fag
Being used and abused and served like hell
Till one day you was found hung dead in a cell

It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young

So, don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

the moment,atomic tom,"Walking by the busy set
Where she is dressed
The silhouette
Of innocence
And so I slow my pace
To take it all in

Then someone calls
""We're rolling sound.""
And ""ready lights.""
The camera frames
A frail disguise
As she feels the mark
And makes me want her

I'm frozen in place
She reveals the fear on my face
And I know she can see right through me

I wanna hold on
I wanna hold on to this

Waking up from half a dream
That seems so real
The image fading, dissipating
So I fight the day
To say last goodbyes

And when she'd gone I spend my time
Retracing lines
The curve, the shapes
Her name in lines
Just reminds me how

I'll never have her (have her)

I wanna hold on (wanna hold on)
I wanna hold on to this (wanna hold on)
The moment has come (wanna hold on, hold on)
The moment comes down to this (wanna hold on, hold on)
It comes down to this

That kind of girl
Whose secret world
You're never invited

And if you had to decide
To fall asleep or stay in line
Wake up
Wake up, wake up
Make up your mind

I wanna hold (hey hey hey)
I wanna hold on (hey hey hey)

I wanna hold on
I wanna hold on to this
The moment has come
And the moment comes down to this
It comes down to this

And the moment has come"

When they put me six feet underground
Will the big bad beautiful you be around

Everyone says they know you
Better than you know who
Everyone says they own you
More than you do

When I lay me down
Will you still be around
When they put you six feet underground
Will the big bad beautiful moon be around

the ocean,barefoot truth,"I never thought that I would make amends with the ocean
But as we left the shores my eyes began to tear
Why had it always caused me uneliusive feelings?
Why had it always left me fear?
Truth is my thoughts that had me sinkin' to the bottom
Driftin' like a bottle through the sea without a sound
And when I finally washed up to your sandy shorebed
The message in the bottle had no writing to be found

Well this is my paradise
This is all I really need
And I can't live without this feeling
Of the ocean around me, yeah

Waves crashin' on the shore sunrise the water's sparkling
Warm sand between my toes diggin' in there's so much comfort
I'm not knowin' where it ends or if it keeps on going
An entire world beneath my body as I float, yeah

This is my paradise
This is all I really need
And I can't live without this feeling
Of the ocean around me, yeah

This is my paradise
This is all I really need
And I can't live without this feeling
Of the ocean around me, yeah

All the inner thoughts you can't remember
Yet you cherish all the same
Sensual forever on the terrace
Till the morning shut us down

Ordinary rivalry will make you think it over
It's a feeling
Second thoughts are stupid thoughts
They're always coming up when love gets easy
It takes you over

The temperature is rising and
Your mind begins to boil
Never mind the cool
The obvious sensation
Of the young love
Of the real love

And can you feel the beat within'

The texture of our sin

Of the real love

Is it you?
Are you the one that shines on me
Is it you?
Are you the one that walks with me

Waiting for you all my life
Girl you really are sublime

We can spill it all
And see the beauty of it all
And see the terror
Love is always raw
When you're naked on the floor
It takes you over
It makes you sober

the only exception,glee cast,"When I was younger I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart as I watched as he tried to reassemble it

If it does not exist

Darlin', you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone, keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I'd have sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

the orchids,califone,"When all the numbers swim together and all the shadows settle
When doors forced open shut again a flytrap and a petal
My eyes burn and claws rush in to fill them
And in the morning after the night i fall in love with the light
It is so clear i realize and here at last i have my eyes

When all the figures sound retreat the soft skin starts to shrivel
When dreams made real become less sweet the orchid and the metal
My sex turns and claws rush in to spill them
And in the morning after the night i fall in love with the light
It is so pure i can arrive without the fear of seeing my eyes

When all the characters full size and every moon is level
When all the spirits burn in lies as center grief by steel
My eyes burn and claws rush in to fill them
But in the morning after the night i fall in love with the light
It is so clear i realize and now at last i have my eyes"

These people are really weird
And they're giving me the fear
Just because you know my name
Doesn't mean you know my game

All of us are in your face
And whisper I'm in the wrong place
Is there more to lose than gain
If I go on my own again, on my own again?

Inside the outsider
(On my own again)
Inside the outsider
(On my own again)
Inside the outsider
(On my own again)
Inside

People are connecting, don't know what to say
I'm good at protecting what they want to take
Spilt the milk at breakfast, hit me double hard
And I grinned at you softly 'cause I'm a fucking wild card

These people are really weird
And they're giving me the fear
Just because you know my name
Doesn't mean you know my game

All of us are in your face
And whisper I'm in the wrong place
Is there more to lose than gain
If I go on my own again, on my own again?

Inside the outsider
(On my own again)
Inside the outsider
(On my own again)
Inside the outsider
(On my own again)
Inside
(Again, again)

All I know is I cannot pretend
So I'm sitting on the outside again

On my own again
Inside the outsider
(On my own again)
Inside the outsider
(On my own again)
Inside the outsider
(On my own again)
Inside
(Again)

On my own again
Inside the outsider
(On my own again)
Inside the outsider

the park,feist,"Why would he come back through the park?
You thought that you saw him, but no you did not
It's not him who come across the sea to surprise you
Not him who would know where in London to find you

With sadness so real that it populates
The city and leaves you homeless again
Steam from a cup and snow on the path
The seasons have changed from the present to past
The past
Turns whole to half
The past

Why would he come back through the park?
You thought that you saw him, but no you did not
Who can be sure of anything through
The distance that keeps you
From knowing the truth

Why would you think your boy could become
The man who could make you sure he was the one?
The one
My one
My one"
the parting glass,the high kings,"Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And all the harm I've ever done
Alas, it was to none but me

And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be to you all

So fill to me the parting glass
And drink a health whate'er befalls
Then gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be to you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay

But since it fell into my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be to you all

Fill to me the parting glass
And drink a health whate'er befalls
Then gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be to you all

La ra la ra la la
La lala lala la la
La ra lala la la
La la la lala la la

But since it fell into my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be to you all

So fill to me the parting glass
And drink a health whate'er befalls
Then gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be to you all
Good night and joy be to you all"
the passenger,bad astronaut,"Wait,
Planet earthquake,
Planet heartbreak, give me this day.
Dates
Pass through a maze;
Are you okay? Are you awake?
Pride,
Yours flies too high;
Yours is too great; yours is to die.
I,
I'm taking no side
I'm going under, for once alive.

Wait, falling airplanes...

Today,
My worries fade away
In suspended dream state,
Somehow I knew.
Erased, everything stops now.

And now I crash with them;
I am a bank deposit,
I'm held accomplice to man's will...
The faith transcending reason,
The passenger descending,
And in an instant time stands still.

Fade,
Planet heartbreak
(Stop thinking)."
the piano,pj harvey,"Hit her with a hammer
Teeth smashed in
Red tongue twitching
Look inside her skeleton

My fingers sting
Where I feel your fingers have been
Ghostly fingers
Moving my limbs

Oh God I miss you
Oh God I miss you
Oh God I miss you
Oh God I miss you
Oh God I miss you

Daddy's in the corner
Rattling his keys
Mommy's in the doorway
Trying to leave

Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening

the portrait,james horner,"Every night in my dreams
I see you. I feel you.
That is how I know you go on.

Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on.

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone

Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You're here, there's nothing I fear,
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on"
the preacher,jamie n commons,"Up in the north where the cold wind blows
Over the prairie gold
Theres a church bell screaming
On the steeple high
Gather ye children of men

With one hand on the trigger, one hand on the cross
Jesus and his family are two things he's lost

March him to the scaffold and string him up on high
The call came out from the crowd
Theres blood in their eyes and blood in their hearts
For, the blood turning dry on his hands

With one hand on the trigger, one hand on the cross
Jesus and his family are two things he's lost

He cries Oh Lord what have you done
You wont never see heaven or kingdom come
He cries Oh Lord what have you done
You wont never see heaven or kingdom come

Listen to me my wayward flock
He cried with a noose round his neck

I spoke to the lord on the mountain top
His bidding was all I could do
I spoke to the lord on the mountain top
His bidding was all I could do

He cries Oh Lord your works been done
Now show me heaven or kingdom come
He cries Oh Lord your works been done
Now show me heaven or kingdom come

One hand on the trigger, one hand on the cross
Jesus and his family are two things he's lost."

No pressure
No pressure, I know you're real

You are such a liar
I've never denied you, I was for sure

But it's really out of my control
The way you feel is not my problem
I don't wanna see you go
But I don't have time to solve this
And you don't have the right
After all you put me through
I'm starting to realize

Pressure
The pressure, I know you feel
Pressure
The pressure, just keep it real

Major weed smoke in the air
Pass it like you just don't care
Have you seen my fucks to give?
I have none, I cannot live with

The pressure
The pressure, you know I feel
The pressure (pressure)
The pressure to keep it real

Pay attention to the signs
Stay and listen, you will find
Everything ain't rocket science
Every gem is not a diamond

But the pressure
The pressure will make you feel

Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, ohh
The pressure (the pressure)
The pressure, the pressure

the puzzle,ane brun,"I walked into love
I walked into a minefield
I never heard of

I walked into love
I walked into a minefield
I never heard of

Her remains were spread out like the pieces of a puzzle
It took her 365 days putting them together
The pieces were quite difficult to distinguish from eachother
They were tiny and the clear blue sky
Went on forever

Clearly the corners were an easy start
That was when everyone was still
Helping me out
When it was time to fill in the frames
They left – they thought I ought
To have gotten over you
By then

Her remains were spread out like the pieces of a puzzle
It took her 365 days putting them together
The pieces were quite difficult to distinguish from eachother
They were tiny and the clear blue sky
Went on forever

I wouldn't do that to you
I wouldn't do that to you
I wouldn't do that to you
I wouldn't do that to you

the rain,k-os,"You say you love me, but then you turn and walk away
All for a love not even born yesterday
I see you on the streets and you just pass me by
You think I got no feelings, think I'm living high
But let me tell ya...
I could be on the TV, I could be in their magazines
But it's never enough when you felt the touch
Of an angel that's rocking your soul

Chorus:
When the Rain comes down
You're never around
But when the sun comes up
You always steal the fire
And Rain comes down on this side of town
But people have no feelings
They just run around
They just... x2

We keep chasing dollars, it's making me holler
I just don't know
I don't need a cheque I need some respect
So people you know
And the war, and the babies crying
And the car and the house and the rings
And the things that don't mean nothing?

You can try to hate, classify and make you're rate down
But I'm here to elevate, I'll be floating in outer space now

Chorus:
When the Rain comes down
Will you be around?
When the sun comes up
Will you always steal my fire?
And Rain comes down on this side of town
But people have no feelings
People... Woo..."
the real thing,gwen stefani,"I've seen your face a thousand times
Have all your stories memorized
I've kissed your lips a million ways
But I still love to have you around

I've held you too many times to count
I think I know you inside out
And we're together most days
But I still love to have you around

And you're the one I want and it's not just a phase
And you're the one I trust, our love is the real thing

Don't go away
My love (my love)
I want you to stay
In my life
Don't go away
My lover (my love)
I'm happiest when we spend time

You're a salty water, ocean wave
You knock me down, you kiss my face
I know the storms will always come
But I still love to have you around

And heavens knows what will come next
So emotional, you're so complex
A roller coaster, built to crash
But I still love to have you around

You're the one I want and it's not just a phase
You're the one I trust, our love is the real thing

Don't go away
My love (my love)
I want you to stay
In my life
Don't go away
My lover (my love)
I'm happiest when we spend time (it's only you and I)
(It's only you and I)

It's you there when I close my eyes
And you in the morning
I never thought you'd still be mine
Or I'd really need to have you around

Don't go away
My love (my love)
I want you to stay
In my life
Don't go away
My lover (my love)
I need you, you're my love supply

Don't go away
My love (you're my love supply)
I want you to stay
In my life (every day, every night)
Don't go away
My lover (you're my love supply)
I need you, you're my love supply"
the return,the black angels,"When it's 3 o'clock in the early morn'
You've got your bed face on at the break of dawn
So, you light another cigarette, say your prayers
The thief has come equipped with his gun
Come on now

When he came without warning like three-thousand men swarming
Right out of the sky like a torch in the night
When the rocks were screaming, and they said it was dreaming
I've been here before, when I was killed in the war

There's a man who can decide between what's wrong and what's right
There's a son who fight for what his father thinks is right
Like Judas of old, with a kiss you'll be sold
And those who deny will drop like flies"
the ride,joan as police woman,"Starting now the wait is over
As long as you jump the ride
'Cause I won't highway-walk forever
As long as you jump the ride
As long as you follow me
This is what I do, like I do
I've been on the ride before
It never stops at all
It never stops at all
You'll start your engines like a virgin
As long as you jump the ride
We'll cut the whip and lose the anchor
As long as you jump the ride
As long as you follow me
This is what I do, like I do
I've been on the ride before
It never stops at all
It never stops at all
As long as you follow me
This is what I do, like I do
I've been on the ride before
It never stops at all
It never stops at all
Don't you feel for us?
That we're on the round and round?
Don't you hear the endless motor sound?
As long as you follow me
This is what I do, like I do
I've been on the ride before
It never stops at all
It never stops at all
Never stops at all"
the river,chely wright,"On a Friday night where I grew up
There ain't a whole lot you can do
The same ole' faces the same ole' places
Ain't nothin' ever new

After the football game we'd hang around
The high school parking lot
Then we'd pile into a couple of cars
And head off to our favorite spot

Down to the river
We went to the river

My sophomore year was a carbon copy
Of the ones that came before
'Til a night in late November
That shook us all down to the core

We'd won the game by twenty points
Couldn't wait to celebrate
But our lead car was goin' way too fast
They never even hit the breaks

They went into the river
Deep in the river

We buried Laurie Mabrey
In the clothes that she'd been wearin'
Her cheerleader outfit never looked
So out of place

That sweater and that pleated skirt
Of blue and white and crimson
Just didn't belong in that shiny silver case

I moved here to Nashville
On May twelfth of eighty-nine
And I started gettin' letters once a week
From this friend of mine

I'd gone to school with Christine Thuro
From kindergarten on
She'd say, ""Hang in there 'cause
I just know you're gonna be a star""

She and her boyfriend and a couple of kids
I guess she met through him
Set out for the Marais Des Cygne
To try to cool off by takin' a swim

There'd been a lot of rain that summer
And the current was too strong
I heard they did all they could
But Christine she was gone

Into the river
She died there in the river

I was baptized in that same water
Gave my soul to Jesus
How can such a peaceful place
Be filled with so much pain

'Cause two young mothers lost their daughters
Right there for no reason
I swear I'll never go down there again

Back to the river
That mean ole' river
That beautiful river
That damn ole' river
That damn ole' river

That damn ole' river
That beautiful river"
the rooster,outkast,"Hold up!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Somebody done told you you wrong
Thought it was just gon and gon' end off like that there huh?
Hot, too Hot
Too Hot
Too motherfucking hot
Hot motherfucking thug
Give me a back rub
Oh, I didn't even say bitch
I'm sorry, I apologize
I'm sorry, I take that back
Ok, I start out all alone
'Cause my baby mama left me
Now there's nobody at home
Beginning to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned
Well it's some real shit and I'm living it through this song
A moving vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escaping me
In the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di before she died
Therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win
Throw your neck out, throw your back out
Throw your neck out, throw your back out (my neck and my back)
Throw your neck out, throw your back out (hmm, my neck and my back)
Throw your neck out, throw your back out (throw your back out)
Round two, a single parent, what is Big to do?
Throw a party? Not hardly! I'm trying to stay up outta that womb
Or that p-u-s-s, us I say, ""USS""
Luther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed
Smashed, pushed to the limit, smash and turned it timid
Hell everyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked hell
The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold
Both of our tempers were on swole
For the most part you fuss, fight, fart
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign
Throw your neck out, throw your back out
Throw your neck out, throw your back out (my neck and my back)
Throw your neck out, throw your back out (hmm, my neck and my back)
Throw your neck out, throw your back out (throw your back out)
K-o, knocked out by technicality
The love has kissed the canvas
Now the whole family is mad at me
My daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings
And then my son he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing
I think he's pissed
I can't dismiss the matter of the fact because he saw you and me argue
Now the energy is coming back
Set an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track
But I'm married to the music and committed to the wax
Tapes and CD's, baby, please
You make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string
So why are we arguing?
Tapes and CD's, baby, please
You make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string
So why are we arguing?
Throw your neck fucking out, throw your back out
Throw your neck out, throw your back out (my neck and my back)
Throw your neck out, throw your back out (hmm, my neck and my back)
Throw your neck out, throw your back out (throw your back out)
Tapes and CD's, baby, please
You make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string
So why are we arguing?
Tapes and CD's, baby, please
You make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string
So why are we arguing?
Throw your neck fucking out, throw your back out
Throw your neck out, throw your back out (my neck and my back)
Throw your neck out, throw your back out (hmm, my neck and my back)
Throw your neck out, throw your back out (throw your back out)"
the sea,carbon leaf,"I woke up from a dream
A white rose was floating to greet
The sea
Morning light, race me down
The wooden path can't catch me now
The sea
Will you wade with me?
You and me, all alone?
Wadin' on the sea
I grab your toes and now I understand
The symbol of the rose, it floats on my hand
On this great sea strand

Hang on to me and I'll hang on to you
Until the end, or until the day is through
And as we float, I'll wash away that part of me
That lures the devil in the deep blue sea

Will you always float here with me?
I don't want to send second-hand notes
To you my friend, about the sea
So, we jump back into the party
And we wade our way out past the bar
I had not, I had not planned on going out this far

Hang on to me and I'll hang on to you
Until the end, or until the day is through
And as we float, I'll wash away that part of me
That lures the devil in the deep blue sea

Hang on to me and I'll hang on to you
Until the end, or until the day is through
As we float, I'll wash away that part of me
That beckons the devil in the deep blue sea

'Cause the devil has a smile
And the devil has a smile
And it's thorny and it's wild
And it grows from deep inside
And you try to swim away
But the devil calls this play
Deep blue sea, deep blue sea, deep blue sea
And the devil has a smile
And the devil has a smile
And it's thorny and it's wild
And it grows from deep inside
And you try to swim away
But the devil calls this play
Deep blue sea, deep blue sea, deep blue sea

Deep blue sea, deep blue sea
Deep blue sea, deep blue sea
Deep blue sea, deep blue sea
Deep blue sea, deep blue sea"
the seventh seal,scott walker,"Anybody seen a knight pass this way
I saw him playing chess with death yesterday
His crusade was a search for God and they say
It's been along way to carry on

Anybody hear of plague in this town
The town I've left behind was burned to the ground
A young girl on a stake her face framed in flames cried
I'm not a witch
God knows my name

The knight he watched with fear
He needed to know
He ran where he might feel God's breath
And in the misty church
He knelt to confess
The face within the booth was Mr. Death

My life's a vain pursuit of meaningless smiles
Why can't God touch me with a sign?
Perhaps there's no one there answered the booth
And Death hid within his cloak and smiled

This morning I played chess with death said the knight
We played that he might grant me time
My bishop and my knight will shatter his flanks
And still I might feel God's heart in mine

And through confession's grille
Death's laughter was heard
The knight cried No you've cheated me
But still I'll find a way
We'll meet once again and once again
Continue to play

They met within the woods the knight his squire and friends
And death said now the game shall end
The final move was made
The knight hung his head
And said you've won I've nothing left to play

The minstrel filled with visions sang to his love
To look against the stormy sky
The knight his squire and friends
Their hands held as one
Solemnly danced toward the dawn

His hourglass in his hand his scythe by his side
The master death he leads them on
The rain will wash away the tears from their faces
And as the thunder cracked they were gone"

Shoes for runnin' then take off our clothes
We can tickle and nible

I know you can't wait 'cause the bed is soggy
Must be the rain, don't close your window
It doesn't really matter, just enjoy the show

the smile,schiller,"There is a smile
A smile upon your face
I wonder why
Why you're full of grace
There was a time
My feeling was replaced
I wanna hide
Hide in your embrace

Und geben uns nicht dem Schmerze hin
Sondern zeigen ihn vor"

Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound

I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh baby won't you come again?
She said ""I've got a problem with your shoes and your tunes
But I might move in and I thought that you were straight
Now I'm wondering""

You're so conceited
I said that I love you
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you

And I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

It's not about reciprocation it's just all about me
A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe
And there's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean Philosophy

And you say I'm such a cliche
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you call me when you're bored
And you're playing with yourself

You're so conceited
I said that I love you
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you

THESE MAGIC MOMENTS"
the story,bun b,"Say, this is the realist shit I ever wrote or I said
Wake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed
Hurting my heart and hanging over my head
'Bout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred

C L Butler better known as Chad or Pimp C
The closest homeboy that I ever had
Now when we first met, we wasn't on the same page
From pettiness understandings that got cleared up with age

Two young boys who was ready to mash
Put P A on the map and maybe make a little cash
Jumped down with Big Tyme, put down a few songs
Everybody co-signed saying that we could do no wrong

Then hit the streets with a big ass bang
Them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang
Dropped, ""Tell Me Something Good"" took off and went live
Shit, next thing you know we was signing to Jive

Dropped, ""Too Hard to Swallow"" ""A Pocket Full of Stones""
Put the remix on ""Menace"" shit we had it going on
Got, love in the streets and played on the air
But the homey putting us out, wasn't playing too fair

Had to separate ourself, bring in a new team
But sometimes the other side ain't always what it seems
We dropped ""Super Tight"" a album full of killer flows
But then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes

We didn't realize what was happening on the real
And new management was cutting back room deals
Hiding different money and concealing the price
He had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice

Took a while to catch on, to what homey was doing
But by the time we did, all the paperwork was in ruins
Nigga kept all the receipts so we couldn't file taxes
The next thing you know, IRS hitting us with axes

Pimp you owe seven figures, Bun you owe six
Better get your paper together, get this shit fixed
Remixed the management team and tried it ourself
Cussed out the GM, almost got put on the shelf

Fuck it, dropped ""Ridin' Dirty"" instant classic in the South
Reclaimed the southern title, shut everybody's mouth
Got some clout in the game, boys calling us the greatest
But meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters

The old manager calling and say he fina' sue
And put a padlock on the everything we trying to do
Put a call out to the Prince, this nigga still hating
We got heat for the streets, and we can't keep the people waiting

He made a call to [Incomprehensible] and folks, telling the man
You gotta cut UGK some slack understand
Young Pimp got the plan, Bun got the drawl
Rap-A-Lot had our back and we just waiting on Jive

We got the big bosses on the same page
So me and young Pimp went hit 'em from center stage
Next thing you know we got this call from the N.Y.
It's Jay-Z saying y'all niggaz getting fly

He doing ""Volume 3"" and got a track from Timb
And wondered could some trill niggaz rock it with him
Shit big Bun was all for it, but Pimp wasn't sure
But ""Big Pimpin"" hit 'em 187-Pure

Number one song on every station you turn on
MTV and BET we getting our burn on
Grammy nominated can't believe that we made it
And we got a call from Jive that left us all faded

And it stated, that due to the success of the track
We here at Jive records, would like to piggy back
Get another beat from Timb, then get a from Jay
Let Hype shoot the video and we'll be on the way

Shit it sounded okay, but me I had to ask
If we don't do Big Pimpin 2, would you still put us on blast
A song like that might take a nigga to the top
But my true fan base, might think a nigga flop

They got mad and put niggaz on hold
For damn near a year till the buzz got cold
So we said fuck 'em and went back to the basics
Trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix

We put ""Dirty Money"" together and it was aces
But that's around the time that Pimp caught two cases
He got probation, said, ""Fuck you hoes""
We finish the album, got ready to do a couple shows

And then he violated, one month before we dropped
And shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped
Now 30 days done, we back to the nitty-gritty
Album got released, big showdown in Chocolate City

Niggaz with masks on, vests and all black
It's Christmas 2000 and 1, bitch we was all that
Strongest on the block, nobody could budge
And then he violated, now we right back before the judge

They calling him a nuisance, put my dog behind a fence
It was January 28th, he ain't been home since
Threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses
Standing cold, CEO, now I'm the fucking boss

Had the devil on my back, got to drinking and drugging
Had to make a choice, get back to rapping or thugging
So I walked into my bedroom, got down on my knees
Put my hands together and I prayed Lord please

Let me get past this over water that's trouble
And get back up on my grind on the double
He said son don't worry 'cause it's not really hard as it seem
And I can turn your nightmares back into dreams

You just got to stay true to yourself and succeed
Then push away from the devil and get closer to me
And every since that night man I promise I been on it
Giving that killer flow to anybody who want it
Pimp the pen like never before, I'm breaking 'em G

Not to mention I got the world screaming free Pimp C
So soon as you make parole and they open the doors
You ain't gotta worry about nothing, the world is yours
Ain't no mo' struggles my nigga and no mo' stripe
I kept it real because to me it's UGK for life"
the stranger,tuxedomoon,"We used to be in this together
I miss the years when we were side by side
I hope that you still remember
The fun we had
But all moments pass
I'll take them with me in the future
We have grown apart all for the best
When I see you now there's nothing left
We shared all we could
It's time to let it rest
It's been a long time
Where have you been?
Oh how you've changed
As if you're someone else
I never thought you'd be a stranger
To me, today
Belongs to the past
And I'll take them with me in the future
We have grown apart all for the best
When I see you now there's nothing left
We shared all we could
It's time to let it rest
Before you go
I must admit
I miss this world
Of you and me
But life goes on
Is what they say
So who am I to disagree?
Rest let it rest
And we'll never meet again
Cause even though I miss the past
The future has the upper hand
So we have to move on"
the sun,alice coltrane,"Angel of mercy, how did you find me?
Where did you read my story?
Pulled from the papers, desperate and hurting
Seeking a momentary fix
All I wanted to say, all I wanted to do
Is fall apart now
All I wanted to feel, I wanted to love
It's all my fault now
A tragedy I fear
Angel of mercy, how did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy, how did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?
I see you
Whoa whoa whoa
I feel you
Whoa whoa whoa
Fortress of daylight
Caught me on standby
Waiting to catch the quickest plane
To fly me to nowhere
It's better than somewhere
That's where I've been and nothings changed
All I wanted to say, all I wanted to do
Is fall apart now
All I wanted to feel, I wanted to love
It's all my fault now
A tragedy I chose
Angel of mercy, how did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy, how did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?
I see you
Whoa whoa whoa
I feel you
Whoa whoa whoa
I'm so lost in you
A tragedy, it seemed to be over now
A tragedy, it seemed to be over now
Angel of mercy, how did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy, how did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?
I see you
Whoa whoa whoa
I feel you
Whoa whoa whoa
I feel you
Oh oh whoa
I feel you
Oh oh oh"
the swimmer,sleater-kinney,"The swimmer is so far from the distant shore
The only time she never feels alone
On the land her body distorts
In the water lines are true to her mind
I can hardly see you now
Are you getting closer and
Do you know yo're the one?
They will never understand
How washed up you feel on the land
The sport light of the sun, it shines on

The Swimmer knows she'll never touch the floor
She can float unharmed by murky wars
And the land is as plain as her skin
But the water shines like the star in her mind"
the thing,phil harris,"While I was walkin' down the beach
One bright and sunny day
I saw a great big wooden box
A-floatin' in the bay
I pulled it in and opened it up
And much to my surprise
Oh, I discovered a...
Right before my eyes
Oh, I discovered a...
Right before my eyes

I picked it up and ran to town
As happy as a king
I took it to a guy I knew
Who'd buy most anything
But this is what he hollered at me
As I walked in his shop
""Oh, get out of here with that...
Before I call a cop""
""Oh, get out of here with that...
Before I call a cop""

I turned around and got right out
A-runnin' for my life
And then I took it home with me
To give it to my wife
But this is what she hollered at me
As I walked in the door
""Oh, get out of here with that...
And don't come back no more""
""Oh, get out of here with that...
And don't come back no more""

[Instrumental Interlude]

I wandered all around the town
Until I chanced to meet
A hobo who was lookin' for
A handout on the street
He said he'd take most any old thing
He was a desperate man
But when I showed him the...
He turned around and ran
Oh, when I showed him the...
He turned around and ran

I wandered on for many years
A victim of my fate
Until one day I came upon
St Peter at the gate
And when I tried to take it inside
He told me where to go
Get out of here with that...
And take it down below
Oh, get out of here with that...
And take it down below

The moral of this story is
If you're out on the beach
And you should see a great big box
And it's within your reach
Don't ever stop and open it up
That's my advice to you
'Cause you'll never get rid of the...
No matter what you do
Oh, you'll never get rid of the...
No matter what you do"
the trial,the sadies,"I wish that I could be the way I once was
but God's got other plans for me
Some people say the worst is almost over
but I don't see how that could be

When I think too much about it
I can barely breathe
And if I'm still alive
when the autumn kills the leaves
I guess I'll be what they consider free

They'll say what makes you happy
but I warn you:
This time I'm not gonna listen
It's hard to tell until you look a little closer
Then you can see right through 'em

Every time I think about it
I can barely breathe
And if I'm still alive
when the autumn kills the leaves
I guess I'll be what they consider free

They'll lead us all to water but I'll bet you
They'd just as soon watch us drown
It never happens how you really want it
So hope someday you'll live it down

When I think too much about it
I can barely breathe
And if I'm still alive
when the autumn kills the leaves
I guess I'll be what they consider free"
the truth,camille jones,"Tell em all I'm on vacation,
Say I went to visit friends,
That you ain't heard or seen from me in quite a while,
When they ask you where I've been,
Tell em I'm out on the west coast where it don't ever rain,
And that I'm probably doing fine,

[Chorus:]

Just don't tell em I've gone crazy,
That I'm still strung out over you,
Tell em anything you want to,
Just don't tell em all the truth,
Yeah don't tell em all the truth,

Tell em all I'm out in Vegas,
Blowin' every dollar I ever made,
Tell em that I must be into something bad for me cause,
I sure lost a lot of weight,
Tell em I'm out on the road with some old rock and roll band,
Living like a gypsy can,

[Repeat Chorus:]

The truth is that I'm asking you to lie,
And we both know that it ain't right,
But if you ever loved me please,
Have some mercy on me,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

Tell em anything you want to,
Just don't tell em all the truth,
Yeah don't tell em all the truth,
I still need you,
Yeah that's the truth,
I still love you,
Baby that's the truth."

the very thought of you,frank sinatra,"The very thought of you and I forget to do
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do.

And foolish though it may seem, to me that's everything.
The mere idea of you, the longing here for you

It's just the thought of you, the very thought of you, my love."

Dragged myself across the bed
Alice went to wonderland

'Cause I'm a wanderer

Oh that really blew my mind

It's a bore
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer
And so it's up and out
And on and off the road
Won't have no troubles

Is my home
No need to worry

I hear you talking a lot of similarities
Your choice of words
And all the fantasies

Just the way we are
I guess you've seen it now
A mirror of ourselves sure makes us weird
Falling down from a mountain of frights
What's there to hold on to?

The way you make us all smile
And the despair when you just won't go to sleep
You could have me walking a mile to make you smile
Still it's not really a weep

I know you fooled me a million times
I just can't help it, don't know why

Just the way we are I guess you've seen it now
A mirror of ourselves sure makes us weird
Falling down from a mountain of frights
What's there to hold on to?

I know you hate it
But they really have to do what they do
You're crying out your wishes I understand
Yet they don't have a clue

Just the way we are I guess you've seen it now
A mirror of ourselves sure makes us weird
Falling down from a mountain of frights
What's there to hold on to?

Falling down from a mountain of frights
What's there to hold on to?"
the way we were,barbra streisand,"Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were

Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Or has time re-written every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply to choose to forget

So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were"
the way you look tonight,air,"I like the way you look tonight
No blood in your vein, what does it mean?
Trashy art everywhere, on the screen
Slow motion aftertaste, I've had foresight

That's the way you look tonight
I like the way you look tonight

Free union rider in the sun
Here comes the lord of audio beauty
Do you really have a digital body?
People like you grim, lust for fun

That's the way you look tonight
(The way you look tonight)
I like the way you look tonight
(The way you look tonight)

(That's the way) that's the way you look tonight
(The way you look tonight)
(I like the way) I like the way you look tonight"
the way,bonnie 'prince' billy,"Winter comes and snow
I can't marry you, you know
Without children to grow
I can't marry you, you know

Love me the way i love you
Love me the way i love you

Take a year in your hands
You can find another man
Let your unloved parts get loved
I will be your man

Places you should be afraid
Into the river we will wade

Love me the way i love you
Love me the way i love you"

Baby, there's no need to cry

You fused my broken bones
Back together, then
Lift the weight of the world
From my shoulders again
Every little piece in your life will add up to one
Every little piece in your life - will it mean something to someone?
Every little piece in your life will add up to one
Every little piece of your life will mean something to someone
You touch my face God whispers in my ear
There are tears in my eyes
Love replaces fear
You touch my face God whispers in my ear
There are tears in my eyes

the wheel,rosanne cash,"How long was I alseep?
When did we plan to meet?
Have you been waiting long for me?
When did the sky turn black?
Do you still want me back?
I'll pick it all up piece by piece.

And the wheel goes round and round.
And the flame in our souls will never burn out.
And the wheel, and the wheel goes round.

I am a river with a voice.
I came into your life by choice.
And none can judge just how that feels.
You are a messenger from God.
You are the angel I forgot.
And who's to say that it isn't real?

And the wheel goes round and round.
And the flame in our souls will never burn out.
And the wheel, and the wheel goes round.

I'm not looking for the answers.
Oh, darling don't you see
That just to know the question
Is good enough for me.

Take up the hearts you came to heal.
Put down your dagger and your shield.
You need fear nothing now from me.
I see the essence of the man.
I stand before you as a friend.
The truth moves through us even when we sleep.

And the wheel goes round and round.
And the flame in our souls will never burn out.
And the wheel, and the wheel goes round."

Who have no time for natures natural schools

Thinks he's so slick

He'll kiss you on the lips
But he'll get sick

I've had enough
With unrequited love

Leads me to my grave

Was the sick of my spine

Give it up
And I will make you mine
I will buy you things

the world,milosh,"I'm sitting here thinking about a way to take us from our home
And not be swallowed by the past
Cause all I need's my pretty baby
To come away with me
The world's pulling at my feet
The world's pulling at our feet

Come away with me
Come away with me
Cause time is pushing by so fast
Let's brush our eyes with the seas of distant places
Don't let this feeling pass
The world's pulling at our feet
The world's tugging at our feet

And I'm hoping for
I'm hungry for
Beautiful things to fill these spaces
They spread across this flow that is our future
Little pieces round
The world's nipping at our feet
The world's nipping at our feet"
them,the jim carroll band,"They hit you with their papers when you're living
on loan. They're the ones who say nothing when you
answer the phone. You see them in the alleys when
you're passing late at night, but you tell your friend
to check it and there's no one in sight.
I never wanted it
I never asked for it
I surely didn't sleep with them
If the phone rings, don't answer it

Death is their only way to survive
The neck of Anubis strangled by wire

They hold their eyes in their fist
One is fire . . . one is ice
They roll them across the bed like some loaded dice

7 come 11 but I could not stay
I kissed her eyes on the sheets
I took a bus to yesterday

Their flesh is a cemetery, centuries old . . .
You are free as a lap dog
Just do what you're told

They wear spandex and gloves
And feed on fetus flesh
They're the fashion rage
Of the empirical age

But I never wanted them
Never asked for them
Didn't sleep with them
Please don't answer it

Death is their only way to get high
The neck of Anubis strangled by wire

They say, ""I'll live for your sins
If you will die for mine . . .""

I'll summon the darkness
If you buy the wine

They're all underage
Yet they're a thousand years old

They make you feel so clever while you're being sold"

Why'd you head on home to Rockaway?"

there goes my baby,charlie wilson,"I was rolling in my car when I pulled up at the mall
Couldn't find a place to park, threw my keys to the valet
I was only there to hang, wasn't lookin' for a thing
I was just about to bounce and then I saw Miss Lady
Then I said to myself

There goes my baby, there goes my destiny
Onliest one for me, there go my baby
There goes my lady, she gon' be the one
We gon' fall in love, we gonna have some babies

She was coming out the shoe store, pretty little thing
A couple of bags in her hand right in front of Macy's
Then I saw her at the food court sipping lemonade
Conversating on her cell phone, looking so amazing
And I said to myself

There goes my baby, there goes my destiny
Onliest one for me, there go my baby
There goes my lady, she gon' be the one
We gon' fall in love, we gonna have some babies

She gon' wear my ring, she gon' take my name
Take her to the cookout, me and her gon' hang
Take her to my mama house, meet Smokey and them
If she need her hair done, see my cousin Carol
I'll treat her like a queen, give her everything
She will be my girl 'til we old and gray
And I knew it from the moment
That I saw her lovely, lovely face

There goes my baby, there goes my destiny
Onliest one for me, there go my baby
There goes my lady, she gon' be the one
We gon' fall in love, we gonna have some babies

There goes my baby, there goes my destiny
Onliest one for me, there go my baby
There goes my lady, she gon' be the one

Crazy, crazy, crazy, it's blowing my mind
That you give me some of your time"

Put all your weapons away,
And your mask, it's failing anyway,
Falling away.

Stop, listen, feel.
Stop, listen, feel.
Stop, listen, feel.
Believe, believe.

And if love is a war,
I won't have any more.

If this is what we call a war,
I won't have it anymore

Stop, listen, feel.
Stop, listen, feel.
Stop, listen, feel.
Believe, believe.

Put all your weapons away,
And end all your casual ties.

these days,ane brun,"There were nights and mornings
When you come to me
Found your way into my bones, my joints
Into my veins
Like an animal you coiled your darkness around me
You spelled your name in charcoal
All over my body
But these days
I just walk with you
These days
I let you stay
A little further away
But I walk with you
These days
I'll let you stay
There were summer days and nights
When I was blind to you
You were quiet and you were still
Even when the moon was full
My temporary state of lightness would scare me
After all, I was sure
You were most wrong then, I was daring
But these days
I just walk with you
These days
I let you stay
These days
I just talk with you
These days
I'll let you stay
A little further away
But I walk with you
These days
I let you stay
The things you've shown me over the years
The roads you blocked and how you'll define me
These days
I just walk with you
These days
I let you stay
These days
I just talk with you
These days, these days"
these foolish things,rod stewart,"A cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fairgrounds painted swing
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw
And you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings, but who's to answer
Or how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

The scent of smoldering leaves, the vail of steamers
Two lovers on their street who walk like dreamers
Or how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

How strange, how sweet
To find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you so near to me

The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside, dance invitations
Or how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

Remind me of you
Remind me of you"
these girls,ryan adams,"Well, girl sometimes I feel just like a boy
Put here on this earth for you to toy around with
Like matchbox cars you buy and burn in your backyard
Like monsters underneath your bed you ain't afraid of yet

But you let me in
And I feel alright
Yeah, I feel alright

Late night girls are anxious and they're coming out to play
And I've been stranded on their doorstep for every night and day
I only want them more, so sad
But when they smile God I've been had
I get hypnotized and I wanna go to bed

I used to pick up shells cast off the reef
One Christmas I got a funeral and they handed me the receipt
How many lies I'd tell without my tongue
Get twisted into memories until I believe in some

And I toy with you
And you toy with me
Can you stop it please?

God bless all the late night girls and they're coming out to play
And I've been stranded in their doorstep for every night and day
I only want them more, how sad
But when they smile, how can anybody feel bad?
Makes me tired and I wanna go to bed

these streets,paolo nutini,"Cross the border into the big bad world
Where it takes you 'bout an hour just to cross the road
Just to stumble across another poor old soul from
The dreary old lanes to the high-street madness
I fight with my brain to believe my eyes
And it's harder than you think to believe this sadness
That creeps up my spine and haunts me through the night

And life is good and the girls are gorgeous
Suddenly the air smells much greener now
And I'm wandering around with a half pack of cigarettes
Searching for the change that I've lost somehow

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know

Where'd the days go, when all we did was play?
And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all
Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall from
Walking by a high-rise to a landmark square
You see millions of people with millions of cares
And I struggle to the train to make my way home
I look at the people as they sit there alone

Life is good, and the sun is shining
Everybody flirts to their ideal place
And the children all smile as a boat shuffled by them
Trying to pretend that they've got some space

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know

these things take time,the smiths,"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wunder-kind
You took me behind a dis-used railway line
And said: ""I know a place where we can go where we are not known""
And then you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

But I can't believe that you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care
But these things take time
And I know that I'm the most inept that ever stepped

I'm spellbound but a woman divides
And the hills are alive with celibate cries
But you know where you came from
You know where you're going and you know where you belong
You said I was ill and you were not wrong

But I can't believe that you'd ever care
And so you never care
But these things take time
And I know that I'm the most inept that ever stepped

Oh, the alcoholic afternoons
When we sat in your room
They meant more to me
Than any, than any living thing on earth

You will leave me behind"

To strip us from power

So you'll never understand me
I'd never been close enough to take the fall

Do you fear me
Can you hear me

thin air,anathema,"Love is free
In time, in peace
And now is here
This life, this dream ...

You know how it feels but... is it all in your mind?
When you know how it feels to be pushed and pulled through your life
And sometimes it seems like there is life in your eyes
And all that I know is I love you

Yes I love you

And it feels like we're already flying
But the air is too thin and we're dying
The clouds all around take us higher
The world far below is on fire
I hold out my hand just to touch you
And all that I know is I love you
A vision a promise of heaven
A reason for being forever

You're just a whisper away

We've come too far to turn back
This is where we stand and face it
This is who we are, one step closer
Into thin air we will go there

We've come too far to turn back
This is where we stand and face it
I feel you breathe
You're just a whisper away

We've come too far to turn back
This is where we stand and face it
This is who we are one step closer
Into thin air we will go there

We've come too far ...
This is where we stand ..."
thinking about you,norah jones,"Yesterday I saw the sun shinin'
And the leaves were fallin' down softly
And my cold hands needed a warm, warm touch
And I was thinkin' about you

But here I am lookin' for signs to lead me
You hold my hand but do you really need me?
I guess it's time for me to let you go
But I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you

So when you sail across the ocean waters
And you reach the other side safely
Well could you smile a little smile for me?
'Cause I'll be thinkin' about you

I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you"

And I'll take you, ooh ooh

Won't you tell your dad to get off my back?
Tell him what we said about Paint It Black
Rock and roll is here to stay
Come inside where it's okay
And I'll shake you, ooh ooh

Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If it's so, well let me know
If it's no, well I can go
I won't make you, ooh ooh"

Nothing's gonna knock me down,
This day,
Nothing's gonna make the upside down.

Swimming in a sea of light,
All that I have is a single day,
That can't be changed.
Flower-power, deflored mine,
I'll be amused for a certain time
And I can't change it,
That's all that I can see.

This day,
Nothing's gonna knock me down,
This day,
Nothing's gonna make the upside down.

Midday's gone,
Half a lifetime,
I'm moving around an apple-pie,
It's just refreshment,
Ladies, babies, having fun,
I know that I'm not the only one,
But I can't change it,
Now it's time to leave.

Nothing's gonna make the upside down."

Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair

Ride with the moon in the dead of night
Everybody scream, everybody scream
In our town of Halloween

I am the clown with the tear-away face
Here in a flash and gone without a trace
I am the who when you call ""who's there?""
I am the wind blowing through your hair
I am the shadow on the moon at night
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright

This is Halloween, this is Halloween

this is how i know,ron sexsmith,"From the darkness to a seed of light
From a garden to a sheet of ice
I feel you move in every sunrise
In the trembling of the leaves
This is how I know you're near me

From the ashes of a broken home
I sent a message to the great unknown
And through the music on the radio
You came to set me free
This is how I know you hear me

This is how I know
Our trials are not in vain
This is how I know
We'll rise and love again
This is how I know

This is how I know
Our trials are not in vain
This is how I know
We'll rise and love again
This is how I know

From a moment to a sea of days
From an ocean to a single wave

That loved us into being

This is how I know it will be"
this is me,girlyman,"This old highway is just a lonely patch of blue and gray
And late at night my memory obfuscates my line of sight
And in my mind I really had no choice, the stars were cold
In my eyes they hung there in dark skies, just still and cold

The wheels of this pickup are rusted and cracked
The lines are uneven, there is no turning back
This is me
All that I am
You will see

The noble mind, it traps four pieces of the heart inside
We came in twos, and two by twos it seemed of little use
We felt the rain, our faces cold and pale, the colors drained
The oceans grew until we floated on a deeper hue

You will become a stranger, you will seize all the land
You will breach the other, count the hours, spill the sand
This is me
All that I am
You will see

A little star of brilliant hope in skies of black we are
And Danish blue is the color of your eyes in June
For many days I've woken with head pains, my eyes ablaze
You never knew because I never told you

The hours of the day wonder how they've been spent
The creases on the bed grow deep, I've made my descent
This is me
All that I am
You will see
All that I have
This is me"

Before they take you down

Gotta look this world
In the eye

Gotta live this life
Till you die

You better have soul
Nothin' less

It's life or death

But life goes on
Don't lose your head
When a deal goes down
Better keep your eye
On the road ahead

It showed me how to laugh and how to cry
It introduced me to some friends of mine
And brightened up some days
It helped me make it through some lonely nights
Oh, what a friend to have on a cold and lonely night
This old guitar gave me my lovely lady
It opened up her eyes and ears to me
It brought us close together
And I guess it broke her heart
It opened up the space for us to be
What a lovely place and a lovely space to be
This old guitar gave me my life, my living
All the things you know I love to do
To serenade the stars that shine
From a sunny mountainside
And most of all to sing my songs for you
I love to sing my songs for you

thursday,asobi seksu,"On gentle ground, I waited for you
In drops of dew, I wished that I were you
With heavy hands, I reached out for you
My skin soaking wet, my eyes searched for you

It seems you lost your way
You've let it all fall apart
Nothing's left here but you
All you do is remind me
Now that we've lost our way
The rest can all fall apart
All I see here is you
All it does is remind me

With sharpened tongue, I cried out for you
And must I refrain now that I need you
The autumn wind feels as if it were you
And swayed through the fields where I once held you

It seems you lost your way
You've let it all fall apart
Nothing's left here but you
All you do is remind me
Now that we've lost our way
The rest can all fall apart
All I see here is you
All it does is remind me

Whistle through your window
We act the same as you

Whistle through your window
We act the same as you"

tiger mountain peasant song,fleet foxes,"Wanderers this morning came by
Where did they go
Graceful in the morning light
To banner fair
To follow you softly
In the cold mountain air
Through the forest
Down to your grave
Where the birds wait
And the tall grasses wave
They do not
Know you anymore
More, more, more
Dear shadow alive and well
How can the body die
You tell me everything
Anything true
In the town one morning I went
Staggering through premonitions of my death
I don't see anybody that dear to me
Dear shadow alive and well
How can the body die
You tell me everything
Anything true

tightrope,laurie anderson,"Last night I dreamed I died and that my life had
Been rearranged into some kind of theme park.
And all my friends were walking up and down the boardwalk.
And my dead grandmother was selling
Cotton candy out of a little shack.
And there was this big ferris wheel
About half a mile out in the ocean,
Half in and half out of water.
And all my old boyfriends were on it.
With their new girlfriends.
And the boys were waving and shouting
And the girls were saying Eeek.

Then they disappeared under the surface of the water
And when they came up again they were laughing
And gasping for breath.

In this dream I'm on a tightrope
And I'm tipping back and forth trying to keep my balance.
And below me are all my relatives
And if I fall I'll crush them.
This long thin line. This song line. This shout.

The only thing that binds me to the turning world below
And all the people and noise and sounds and shouts.
This tightrope made of sound
This long thin line made of my own blood.
Remember me is all I ask.
And if remembered be a task forget me.

Remember me is all I ask.
And if remembered be a task forget me.
This long thin line. This long thin line.
This long thin line. This tightrope.

Remember me is all I ask.
And if remembered be a task forget me.
This long thin line. This long thin line.
This long thin line. This tightrope."

time after time,cassandra wilson,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
And I think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories

Time after
Sometimes you picture me
And I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, and I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after

My picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time
Mmm...
Time after time"
time and time again,counting crows,"I wanted so badly
Somebody other than me
Staring back at me
But you were gone, gone, gone
I wanted to see you walking backwards
And get the sensation of you coming home
I wanted to see you walking away from me
Without the sensation of you leaving me alone
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
I can't please myself
I wanted the ocean to cover over me
I wanna sink slowly without getting wet
Maybe someday, I won't be so lonely
And I'll walk on water every chance I get
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
I can't please myself
So when are you coming home
Sweet angel?
You leaving me alone?
All alone?
Well, if I'm drowning darling, you'll come down this way on your own
I wish I was traveling on a freeway
Beneath this graveyard western sky
I'm gonna set fire to this city
And out into the desert
we're gonna ride
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
I can't please myself
I can't please myself
And I, I can't please nobody else
And time again
Time and time again
Time and time and time and time again
I can't please myself

When a snake of a guy gave me an evil wink
He shook-a me up, he took me by surprise
He had a pickup truck and the devil's eyes
He stared at me and I felt a change
Time meant nothing, never would again

timebomb,ohgr,"Spoken:
The witch is the mother of my dreams
Suicide flies against the backdoor screen
Sex with a witch pss psss
Bestiality among consenting adults
Think gods feel good when applied with cream
Throw caution to the wind, let the games begin and all but (sounds like hubert) complain
Can we talk while were getting hurt?
Suicide flies in a (barbarella?) cartoon
Brazier hung from a chandelier
There's time to get those involved ...?
Out of the slime and darkness it comes to inflict its life destroying poison on the careless, the unweary, the unprotected
No same person would deliberately expose themselves to its venom
No intelligent person would venture within striking distance of its fangs
Yet today young people are flirting with a poison every bit as deadly: done speaking

My name is tokey
Your favorite jokie
Come on and check me out
Bridging the fun
When you're on the run
From everything I'm about
Some say it's silly
Some say familiar
Wanting to feel it out
I've dealt with billions
I've got resilience
Come on and let me out
My favorite fear is there in the air
I feel a timebomb ticking closer to my house
And you're free to go if you care
Closer to the way I come before you in my heart.
And if I'm joking
Why host is smoking
Watch for the bird left out
Seldom the summer
What I have done
Will leave you an empty house
Some say I'm a Virus
Even the liars
Waiting to spread me out
I spent your millions
Taking the chill on
Come on and let me shout
My favorite fear is there in the air
I feel a timebomb ticking closer to my heart
And you're free to go if you care
Closer to the way I felt before you in my heart.
My favorite fear is there in the air
My favorite fear is there in the air
My favorite fear is there in the air
Closer to the way I come before you in my heart."

Things were good again then I had to move back to the bay
I gave you a three week notice you let me out the next day
But I won't blame you for pushing away

And I won't forget what you had to tell me
But I can cheapen the feeling with the likeness to atoms colliding

titan,les savy fav,"Walk 5 feet above the mountain
The landscape remains the same
Walk 5 feet below the ground
The landscape is unchanged

I know my home's eroding
The mountain rise again
I've seen the ocean rising
Only the stones remain
I've heard the Titan stirring
I don't know who to blame

This water tastes like wine
This water tastes like turpentine

I didn't travel all this way
Just to leave a trail of tears behind

I didn't travel all this way
Just to drag a tail behind

I didn't travel all this way
Just to leave my hands and nails behind

Everybody prays that
The rain will shatter the dam
The water will turn the mortar to sand
The engineers have done All they can
But we're damned

Little lost lamb
I've done all I can
The barn door has blown shut
And the brook is rising up

To move, to breath
We must cherish these
We have these things like feet

The townies saw a monster
But the monster saw a man
The coroner's report found a flower in his hand
Before pitchforks and torches
Ferdinand made his last stand

The farmer dropped his sword
And went back to his plow
The children it had frightened
Were even more scared now
The minister and mayor told the people to be proud

And when they went to bed
They tossed and turned all night
But when the sun came up
They never saw the light
And when the worms had finished them
They knew that they were right

This mountain has a mind of its own"

to all the girls,wyclef jean featuring refugee allstars,"Yo, Wyclef, It's time that I confess (Refugee Camp) to all the girls
(Don't do it, don't do it)
To all the girls I loved before
To all the girls I cheated on before
To all the girls I loved before

To all the girls I cheated on before, I tip my hat like Willie Nelson
You got pressure, take a sip of this Molson
Here's what happened, it wasn't my intentions
To fall into seduction while playing a temptation
I thought I had it figured out, but games don't last
The hourglass ran out, I got sprayed with the tear gas
Big men don't cry, hold my feelings inside
Stress brings me?, I gotta hold my pride
When I see you with another guy, jealous thoughts of homicide
Call me selfish when I say Abraham has many wives
You say this is the 90's, either it's gonna be me or her
I found myself in a blur
Lookin' into the clouds thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

Second verse is gonna hurt, based on a true life story
I got married at 24 in New Jersey
You know the feelings start nature take it's course
Two years later 'Clef gets a divorce
When I had the cold feet, I shouldn't've walked the altar
With Dionne Warwick, she could predict my future
Went with my feelings even though it wasn't right
Creepin' with my secret lover in the middle of the night
Back home, break of dawn, dinner's at the table
Thin Line Between Love And Hate is on cable
I'm lookin' at myself thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you snatch her friend

One love, you're lucky to have one love
It sounds bugged, drinking wine from the same jug
One heart, one mind, one soul
She ain't a gold digger, she don't care about your bank-roll
Keep your money, she make her own cheddar
All she want from me is respect like Aretha
Cooked me lasagne, stayed in for the winter
Chilled to the summer, now I'm gone 'til November
Have you seen her?
I think I did
But what I did wrong was take a love for granted
Cause first comes trust, don't rush into lust
Easier said than done, I lust and I must
Passion is a must, but then we start to cuss
We was just makin' love, now we tearing up each other's guts
Like species, she called me an animal
So feel the tongue of the warm-blooded mammal

You know what I'm always thinking
You lift my mood when I'm sinking
Together alone
Together alone

When you're here in my arms
I'm dreaming of you
Life will end when I stop
Believing in you
Together alone
Together alone

You're like a shadow
At the edge of my eye
Like a chill in the air
Like a light in the sky
Like the endless peace after we die

You're a breath in my ear
You're a word in my mind
I'm here on my own
Just two of a kind
Together alone
Together alone

I don't need anybody
I don't want anybody
I'm on my own
Together alone

Nobody can understand us
Nobody to make demands on us
Together alone
Together alone

And as the bombs are falling
I hear a voice that's calling
Together alone
Together alone

You're a breath in my ear
You're a word in my mind
I'm here on my own
Just two of a kind
Together alone
Together alone

Are you listening to me now?
Are you listening to me now?
Together alone
Together alone

You're deep in my heart now
You're deep in my soul now
Together alone
Forever alone

You're a breath in my ear
You're a word in my mind
I'm here on my own
Just two of a kind
Together alone
Together alone
Together alone
Forever alone
Are you listening to me now?
Are you listening to me now?
Together alone
Forever alone
Together alone
Together alone
Are you listening to me now?
Are you listening to me now?"
tokyo,athlete,"I am Tokyo
I am here
I am blazing lights
On your street

I'm an upstart
Bound to cross you
I'm the hypocrite
By your side

She won't forget
And I won't forget

And no one around could tell us apart
Cause we were one mouth
And one robot heart

I am Tokyo
I am here
I am neon signs
On your street

I'm an army
Of wind turbines
Marching over your countryside

And she won't forget
And I won't forget

And no one around could tell us apart
Cause we were one mouth
And one robot heart

There's never enough time
Only, only
A glare off rainbow bridge

Pin prick to the heart
Again and again
I felt every spark

And no one around could tell us apart
Cause we were one mouth
And one robot heart

We're burning through town like there's nothing to lose
Cause we were one mouth
And one robot heart"
tolerate,the national bank,"If what you believe in, is so sacred
That you can not love me anymore
Then I'm sorry, that your wisdom
Won't prepare you for what's in store

Because this bubble, that you call home
Will when the winds of change pick-up
Burst with a vengeance, and a fury
And disarray your every stone

You've got to tolerate
And not just annihilate
Facts of life and facts of fate
And I say this not from hate;

That your hour now is late
So shape up for you own sake!
That your hour now is late
So shape up for you own sake!
You own sake!

Your ideals, I find amusing
And on most I can agree
In fact we are closer to each other
But eye to eye we can not see

And I'm not perfect, I admit it
I can admit to being wrong
But as a friend, not as a brother
To you I dedicate this song

You've got to tolerate
And not just annihilate
Facts of life and facts of fate
I say this not from hate;

That your hour now is late
So shape up for your own sake!
That your hour now is late
So shape up for your own sake!
Your own sake!"
tom traubert's blues,tom waits,"Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did
I've got what I paid for now
See ya tomorrow, hey Frank, can I borrow
A couple of bucks from you?
To go Waltzing Mathilda, Waltzing Mathilda
You'll go Waltzing Mathilda with me

I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
And I'm tired of all these soldiers here
No one speaks English, and every thing's broken
And my stacks are soaking wet
To go Waltzing Mathilda, Waltzing Mathilda
You'll go Waltzing Mathilda with me

Now the dogs are barking and the taxi cab's parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me, you tore my shirt open
And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old bush mill's I staggered, you buried the dagger in
Your silhouette window light
To go Waltzing Mathilda, Waltzing Mathilda
You'll go Waltzing Mathilda with me

Now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her
And the one-armed bandit knows
And the Maverick Chinamen, and the cold-blooded signs
And the girls down by the strip-tease shows go
Waltzing Mathilda, Waltzing Mathilda
You'll go Waltzing Mathilda with me

No, I don't want your sympathy, the fugitives say
That the streets aren't for dreaming now
Manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories
They want a piece of the action anyhow go
Waltzing Mathilda, Waltzing Mathilda
You'll go Waltzing Mathilda with me

And you can ask any sailor, and the keys from the jailer
And the old men in wheelchairs know
That Mathilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Mathilda, Waltzing Mathilda
You'll go Waltzing Mathilda with me

And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace
And a wound that will never heal
No Prima Donna, the perfume is on
An old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
And goodnight to the street sweepers
The night watchman flame keepers and goodnight to Mathilda too"
tomorrow is a long time,bob dylan,"If today was not a crooked highway
If tonight I could finally stand tall
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all

Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin'
Only if she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again

I can't see my reflection in the waters
I can't speak the sounds that know no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I can't remember the sound of my own name

Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Yes, if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin'
Only if she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again

There's beauty in the silver singin' river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else can mach the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes

Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could only hear her heart a-softly poundin'
Only if she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again

Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could only hear her heart a-softly poundin'
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
And I'd lie in my bed once again"
tomorrow never knows,monsoon,"We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth then it's far too late
When they pass away We were talking about the love
We all could share when we find it
To try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love we could save the world if they
Only knew Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows within you and
Without you We were talking about the love
That's gone so cold and the people
Who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know they can't see,
Are you one of them? When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find, peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see
We're all one and life flows on within you and without you"
tomorrow,aileen quinn,"The sun'll come out tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow there'll be sun
Just thinkin' about tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow 'til there's none

When I'm stuck with a day that's gray and lonely
I just stick out my chin and grin and say, oh

The sun'll come out tomorrow
So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow
Come what may

Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya, tomorrow
You're only a day away
Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya, tomorrow
You're only a day away"

too high,dave matthews,"If your arms are brittle beside you,
Wrapped so soft your blood, is running
I'll be there

If you're movin slowly, if we still get there
I'll be there
Such a strong desire, like hunger

All you need to hope you keep your head
Yeaaaah
Is the slow hand quickens

What youve done with all those around you
Hopeful always that someone will come and save you
I'll be there
To watch you sultry turning, seething
I'll be there
Minutes hold on to hours, gets you twisting

All you need to hope you keep your head
Yeaahhh uhhhh unnn
The slow hand quickens

How to leave it with the love you lost
You made them crawl to be without you,
The slow hand quickens

Yes, the sand is empty, in the hour glass
I'll be there
To turn it over and over, in your head

So you keep the hope you'll get your day
Yeaaah ohhhhh
As the slow hand quickens

You see too hard, to break, too cold
To burn, afraid your chance is gone
Wires are crossed, your mouth is lost
You fear you've left it far too long,
The minutes pass, the hours are gone
So hard to find your way alone

The slow hands quicken
The slow hands quicken

Aaahhahaaa

The slow hands quicken"

too much,all time low,"I admit I miss seeing your face, babe
And being alone is starting to take its toll
I'm cold and it's getting old
I admit I should've made some changes
We were so smothered in love
We didn't have a chance to come up for air
What a waste, where did the time go?
Where did our minds go? I don't know
What's this place? Where did our home go?
We won't know, I don't know
Too much of anything is too much
And too much of love can be too much
We had too much time, too much us
So we fought like tomorrow was promised
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
M-m-much, too much
I admit I'm still watching the days go by
And sleeping alone is starting to break me down
It's cold, but I should've known
I admit I made a few mistakes, babe
We were so caught up in love
We didn't have a chance to come up for air
What a waste, where did the time go?
Where did our minds go? I don't know
What's this place? Where did my heart go?
We'll never know, I'll never know
And too much of anything is too much
And too much of love can be too much
We had too much time, too much us
So we fought like tomorrow was promised
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
M-m-much, too much

Like everything was meant to be let go
Take it slow 'cause I can't be on my own
Too much of anything is too much

Too much of love can be too much

That the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around,

And then I see the look in your eyes
Turn around bright eyes,
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes,
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around,

And I dream of something wild.
Turn around,

And I'm lying like a child in your arms.
Turn around,

And I know I've got to get out and cry.

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'd only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right

Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
[All of the time...]
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

Momma would. Papa too.
I love this child. It is all I know how to do

Ha. Now whatever you call me,
Ha ha, I'll even go for that.
'Cause I keep a big, fat bank roll in my pocket, baby
And I'm personal friends with the dealer who owns all the dealerships of all the Cadillacs.
Ha ha!

Ow!
Ma would. Papa too.
I love this child. It is all I know how to do
Come on child, let's play it

transience,steven wilson,"Cut through the country, speed through the dark
A child in a train, Tristessa departs
It's only the start
Ah

Filigree circles 'round her young wrist
Her mother is frowning at something she missed
She fixes her hair (start)
Ah

At the failing of the day, she heard
Her father always say
""Remember, it's only the start""
""It's only the start""

When she drifted off to sleep, she had
The whole world at her feet
Because it's only the start
It's only the start

Before they fell away, it seemed
To matter all the same
But it was only the start
It's only the start
It's only the start"
trapped,utopia,"Brother John saw visions of God
So they put him in chains for acting too odd
As the crowd shouted, ""Off with his head""
The priest said, ""Have mercy let's burn him instead""

Trapped, trapped in a world that he never made
Trapped in a world that he never made

I woke up with my head on the floor
In a windowless cell a room full of doors
I got lost, now I'm so far behind
Took so much advice, forgot my own mind

Trapped, trapped in a world that I never made
Trapped in a world that I never made
Trapped in a world that I never made
Trapped in a world that I never made

We can't be slowed down by a big bunch of lip
And nobody cares about your paranoid trip
But you know death and the Devil sure got it easy today
Souls come so cheap some people give theirs away

You've got to break out, you've got to prove you're alive
And what makes you think that the weak survive
And if you don't have the stomach for all this radical crap
Then have the guts to stand for something or you're gonna be trapped

Trapped in a world that you never made
Trapped in a world that you never made
Trapped in a world that you never made
Trapped in a world that you never made
Trapped"
travelling light,tindersticks,"(Stuart; carla; both)
There are places I don't remember
There are times and days, they mean nothing to me
I've been looking through some of them old pictures
They don't serve to jog my memory

I'm not waking in the morning, staring at the walls these days
I'm not getting out the boxes, spread all over the floor
I've been looking through some of them old pictures
Those faces they mean nothing to me no more

Chorus:

I travel light
You travel light
Everything I've done
You say you can justify, mmm you travel light
I can't pick them out, I can't put them in these sad old bags
Some things you have to lose along the way
Times are hard, I'll only pick them out, wish I was going back
Times are good, you'll be glad you ran away
(Chorus)

Do you remember, how much you loved me?
You say you have no room in that thick old head
Well it comes with the hurt and the guilt, and the memories
If I had to take them with me I would never get from my bed
There's a crack in the roof where the rain pours through
That's the place you always decide to sit
Yeah I know I'm there for hours, the water running down (my) (your)face
Do you really think you keep it all that well hid?

No but I travel light
You don't travel light
Everything I've done
It's just a lie, you don't travel light

I'm travelling light
No you don't travel light
I'm travelling light
No, no, you don't travel light
I'm travelling light
You don't travel light"
travel,the gathering,"Melodic stanzas
Are symphonizing their way
Through your weary head

To feed your distrust
And fill it's mouth with the desire
To soulfully be one with your creation

Not a subject to control
You call upon a higer power
For help and inspiration

The crowd waits
And turns their faces
Towards you expectantly
You give them what they need
But their useless criticism
Makes you die
A bit more inside

Not a subject to control
You call upon a higer power
For help and inspiration

Oh, I swoon
While loudspeakers play soft music

Leaning
Over your fourtieth masterpiece
You must have loved
The colour of these violins

I wish I knew you
Your fit of insanity makes me sad

I wish you knew
Your music was to stay forever
And I hope...

I have no clue
If you know how much it matters
And i hope..."
tree hugger,antsy pants,"Flower said, ""I wish I was a tree""
The tree said, ""I wish I could be a different kind of tree""

The turtle wished that it could fly really high into the sky
Over rooftops and then dive deep into the sea
And in the sea, there is a fish
A fish that has a secret wish
A wish to be a big cactus with a pink flower on it

And in the sea, there is a fish
A fish that has a secret wish
A wish to be a big cactus with a pink flower on it

And the flower would be its offering of love to the desert
And the desert, so dry and lonely, that the creatures all appreciate the effort

Et le jackalope a dit

Pour pouvoir rentrer dans la mer de tous les requins""

And the rattlesnake said
""I wish I had hands so I could hug you like a man""
And then the cactus said, ""But don't you understand?""

""My skin is covered with sharp spikes that'll stab you like a thousand knives
A hug would be nice but hug my flower with your eyes""

treehouse,nada surf,"I can see
The things she does for me
I'm living in a treehouse

I live in constant fear
Awakening must be near
I'm sleeping in a dreamhouse
Up in a tree

I'm tired of the fork in the road
It's pointing to Heaven
But the sky is old
I'm tired of the fork in the road
It's pointing at nothing
'Cause it's all been sold

I live with you
To die in jamais vu
I love you
But this isn't true

I'm tired of the fork in the road
It's pointing to Heaven
But the sky is old
I'm tired of the fork in the road

Waiting for the end"
trinity,common market,"Chorus:
From the start of my heartbeat when art was deep in the fold
To the time of my first rhyme when I was 12 years old
I heard the voice of reason speakin' from the beacon of hope – it said:
""I represent with mind, body and soul""
And ever since then I'm questionin' what I'm told
Explore the options when I'm stoppin' at the fork in the road
The effect of my actions left a crack in the mold
I represent with mind, body and soul

Somatic maggots inhabit the trappings of the tyrant
They bag, flag it, drag it back inside the cave
I'm trackin' the pattern of havoc to stab it with the trident
The class of pragmatic shack up in the enclave
Rumor has it it's a war outside no man is safe from
I prefer the grave to the fate of desolation
Sling blade, slice it into eighths – it's a miracle
Properties of these are three-dimensional – spherical
Tropic of discussion – Capricorn will rival Cancer
Polyglot address me in the manner of a stammerer
Hold the title manager – author of the document
Sworn to secrecy the morning he performed the sacrament
Duty to the derelict – I'm six generations of rap
Savin' the tape for the day I came back
Words preserved – testimony to the tournament
Clock wins again – hold my spot up in the firmament
Virgin turned vanguard – the rod draws the line in the sand
Serpentine along Medina's floor plan
Hard to follow – death will free the swallow from the cage
Bury feathers and collect the treasures with the Jack of Spades
Steel pierce the epidermis of the earth
Heart pump concrete – from beneath the skirt she bleeds
Streaks of streets, we traverse the first cycle
Network connect net-worth – thirst is primal
Scream for the sake of sound to force the barrier back
Hurdle up and over the verbal torch carrier
Sharp turns, muscles in the lower calf burn
The last to finish has his position affirmed
Track's run simulcast – lapse syndication
Tell the magnate hell can wait – practice patience
Majors always wanna push the up-tempo game pace
I favor simple – evaluate the info
Screen print matter – coat the data in emulsion
Teen Clint Eastwood – heard your childhood was troublesome
Watch the way the sharks play the cards they're dealt
Overcoming the odds, well that's a way to create wealth
Stay healthy – balance out your diet with some labor
Make a difference in the system with the wisdom that I gave ya
Save for my dominion all the planets vanish instantly
The key to infinite existence is within the trinity

Chorus

Pop press a plate-a-day: mass distribution
Lack of proper standards contributes to pollution
Who depends on agency protection from the acid rain?
Through the trinity your alkalinity is ascertained
I got digital minerals by the gram
Shots vary, but my apothecary stocks jams
Hot damn – push the cart around the town square peddlin' wares
Observin' how the merchants meddle in affairs
It's pointless – keepin' your finger on the pulse of a dead horse
That trend ends, ""that's when ya lost""
Nine-trinity to Infinity – bless faith kept
Son I got methods I aint even played yet
Put the record on – straight flush, weight crush peppercorn
Snort a line – forge across the borderline of Thessalon
Campin' out in Corinth, passin' through Estonia
Remnants of the message echo back to Macedonia
Homer's had that spot blown for two millennia
Is it possible this 'odyssey' is not linear?
Gravitate to logic – talk about a waste
Writin in my 'launch' pad, I'm like a rock in outer space
Blast to orbit – first to volunteer, last to forfeit
All I need is one mic mounted in the cockpit
Static interferes with my communiqué to Houston
Steeped in the syrup makes it hard for me to move them
Sublime clientele – only time'll tell if more are with us
Though the core, itself, is serendipitous
Cin cin – to the fam a toast to prosperity
Even in my absence I'mma oversee the legacy
Dedicate one to Bambataa if it's not too much to ask
Fashion the future to refract the past
Luminosity – ultra-violent rays graze the temple
We play the tympani to save the trinity..."
trip,hedley,"Some say love is not for sinners
I believe that isn't true
Cause when I was finished sinning
Love came down and showed me you
And you told me how to get there
So I tried to find a way
Then I ran into your garden
But I tripped out the gate
I tripped out the gate

What are you doing to me?
I'm so into you
And the hardest part is knowing that I'll never follow through
You're slowly killing me
And I wish it wasn't true
Cause I'm so into you

Like a ton of bricks it hit me
And woke me from this dream
No matter how hard I tried to wash my hands
I could never get 'em clean
I could never get 'em clean

What are you doing to me?
I'm so into you
And the hardest part is knowing that I'll never follow through
You're slowly killing me
And I wish it wasn't true
Cause I'm so into you

Can you hear me?
Cause I can't change what I've always be

What are you doing to me?
I'm so into you
And the hardest part is knowing that I'll never follow through
You're slowly killing me
And I wish it wasn't true
Cause I'm so into you
I'm so into you
Cause I'm so into you
I'm so into you"

You're soul shall no longer be
Deep inside the hollow space
Only I can fill its ache
And in your ecstasy
Thine eyes search mine pleadingly

Dost take you down beneath the ridge
To where is found the silent bridge
So leap unto thy shame no more
Come sleep among us chambered whores

I will eat you
I will eat you
Eat you"

And I'm reading more into your words than you have put into them,
And that's my problem, but you tied these knots, now you undo them.
You undo them.
Oh and think before you speak my darling.
Cause with your troubled mind,
You're like a goods train running through my life.
We all walk through this world alone,
We keep ourselves untouched, unknown.
You look up to the sky above you,
Read this there - I love you.
Oh it's written there,
You know I love you, love you, love you.
But with your troubled mind,
You're like a goods train running through my life.
And when you're down,
You bring me down too,
And babe that's something I would not do.
I know it's hard, yeah I know it's hard,
And baby that's something I don't disregard.
But with your troubled mind,
You're like a goods train running through my life."

true,paul anka,"So true, funny how it seems:
Always in time, but never in line for dreams,
Head over heels when toe to toe.
This is the sound of my soul.
This is the sound ...

I bought a ticket to the world,
But now I've come back again.
I find it hard to write the next line:
I want the truth to be said.

I know this much is true.
I know this much is true.

With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue,
Dissolving the nerves that have just begun,
Listening to Ella all night long.
This is the sound ...

Always slipping from my hands,
Sands of time of its own.
I find it hard to write the next line:
I want the truth to be known.

I know this much is true.
I know this much is true; it's true.

I bought a ticket to the world,
But now I've come back again,
Finding it hard to write the next line:
I want the truth to be said.

I know this much is true.
I know this much is --
This much is true!"

A treasure not to be corny but word

I wanna give you all the joy that you deserve
I know we argue, sometimes I start to annoy you
But we should never, ever try to destroy two
Hearts joined, intertwined with a passion

Give me a chance, love, that's all I'm askin'
And furthermore, you can be sure that I'll do
Every little thing you need, yes, it's true
I'm not desperate, but I'm the one for you

Trust me, I love you

Take a bath in my blood, get to know me
All out of my secrets
All my enemies are turning into my teachers

Because
Light's blinding
No way dividing
What's yours or mine when everything's shining
Your darkness is shining
My darkness is shining
Have faith in ourselves
Truth.

(Yeah)

Yes I'm only loving, only trying to only love
And yes, that's what I'm trying to is only loving

Yes I'm only loving, trying to only love
I swear to god I'm only trying to be loving

Yes I'm only lonely loving
And yes I'm only feeling only loving, only loving
Ya say it ain't loving, loving but my loving

I wanna only love til I'm only loving
I swear to god I'm only loving.
Trying to be loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, love

Yes I'm only loving, yes I'm trying to only love
I swear to god I'm trying but I'm only loving
Ya say it ain't loving, loving, loving, loving, love my love

But I'm only loving, loving, loving
The Truth."
try again,keane,"I fell asleep on a late night train
I missed my stop and went round again
Why would I wanna see you now?
To fix it up, make it up somehow

Baby, I'll try again
Try again
Baby, I die every night
Every time

What I was isn't what I am
I'd change back
But I don't know if I can

Still I'll try
Try again
Try again
Baby, I die every night
Every time

But I was made the way I am
I'm not a stone, I'm just a man
Lay down your arms and I will lay down mine
Rip back the time that we've been wasting

God, I wish you could see me now
You'd pick me up, and you'd sort me out

Baby, I'll try again
Try again
Baby, I die every night
Every time"
try to remember,jerry orbach,"Try to remember the kind of September
When life was slow and oh, so mellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain was yellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a tender and callow fellow
Try to remember and if you remember then follow

(Follow, follow, follow, follow, follow)
(Follow, follow, follow, follow)

Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember when life was so tender
That dreams were kept beside your pillow

Try to remember when life was so tender
That love was an ember about to billow
Try to remember and if you remember then follow

(Follow, follow, follow, follow, follow)
(Follow, follow, follow, follow)
(Follow, follow, follow, follow, follow)
(Follow, follow, follow, follow)

Deep in December, it's nice to remember
Although you know the snow will follow
Deep in December, it's nice to remember
Without the hurt, the heart is hollow
Deep in December, it's nice to remember
The fire of September that made us mellow
Deep in December, our hearts should remember and follow"

Holding onto me forever
Disco dancing with the rapists
Your only crime is silence

Can't work at this anymore
Can't move, I want to stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Tsunami, tsunami came washing over me
Tsunami, tsunami came washing over me
Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk

Doctors tell me that I'm cynical
I tell them that it must be chemical
So what am I doing, girl?
Cry into my drink, I disappear

Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in-between, in-between, in-between, in-between

Tsunami, tsunami came washing over me
Tsunami, tsunami came washing over me
Tsunami, tsunami came washing over me
Tsunami, tsunami came washing over me

Hit at me again and again
Slip right to me
And slide right through me
Oh, honey, through me
Away from you

She's a head I couldn't kick
She's a head to make you sick
It's a chance I never took
When she caught me with that look
It's a sin I've never seen
And she tells me how it's been
I'm in deep up to my head
Give it all until I'm dead

Don't expect to get inside me

Then, forget what I've done to you.
You were my only friend.
Then I was half alive.
That's more than I could ever ask, but I took your trust and ruined you.
If you were here with me in this room, I'd stand right in front of you, and

Beg you to forget, I was ever inside you.
You were the only thing I ever owned, worth anything at all, and still I
Took your heart and held it and turned it to stone.
When you are sick and tired, and you're confined to your memory, throw me
Out of your mind:
I've been turned to stone."

Que mucho me ha costado
Vestirme con todo y sombrero
Y siento que el viento ya me da en la cara
Qué puedo ir soñando en que viene mañana
Y apareces sin aviso
Como solías hacerlo antes
Te escucho y te siento
Perderlo en silencio

Tan solo mírate
Buscando un atajo para volver, ay mírate
Diciendo el mismo libreto que un día te conté
Buscándome
Tan solo mírate
Pensando que todo fue fácil
Sólo mírate
Creyendo que yo no soy frágil
Sólo mírame
Llorándote, sabiendo que ya es tarde
Preguntas que pienso de cada palabra
Tú crees que ya no duermo
Si sabes que yo te esperaba
Pero se te pasó el invierno
Cayeron hojas en mi pecho
Me fueron sanando

Y así te fuí olvidando

Tan solo mírate
Buscando un atajo para volver, ay mírate
Diciendo el mismo libreto que un día te conté
Buscándole
Tan sólo mirate pensando que todo fue fácil
Sólo mírate
Creyendo que yo no soy frágil
Sólo Mírate
Llorandote sabiendo que ya es tarde
Para pedirme que vuelva
Si en verdad aquí ya nada queda
Tan sólo mírate
Buscando un atajo para volver
Ay mírate
Diciéndome el mismo libreto que un día te conté
Buscándole
Tan sólo mírate
Pensando que todo fue fácil
Sólo mírate
Creyendo que yo no soy frágil sólo mírame llorandote

twenty four hours,joy division,"So this is permanence, love's shattered pride
What once was innocence, turned on its side
A cloud hangs over me, marks every move
Deep in the memory, of what once was love

Oh how I realised how I wanted time
Put into perspective, all I can't decide
But just for one moment, thought I'd found my way
Looked beyond the day in hand, I saw you slip away

Excessive flash points, beyond all reach
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep
Let's take a ride out, see what we can find
A valueless collection of hopes and past desires

Oh how I realised how I wasted time
Looked beyond the day in hand, to see what I could find
Just for one moment, I thought I found my way
All the reasons seem to align, I saw you fade away

Now that I've realised how it's all gone wrong
Gotta find some therapy, this treatment takes too long
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway
Gotta find my destiny, before it gets too late

Thank you
Some slight problems"
twins,maritime,"I find I'm humming the songs of Paul Simon
In my cap and raincoat
Are we just a pile of hearts
With the staggered starts and bones that wander
Over roads have been used
Now the highways are bruised and cars get tired
So I could be jobless and nameless
Well thank goodness for singing in the city

We could be twins
Everybody looks like my friends

I find I'm naming the trees as we're passing
Like Richard, king of captains
All the things that we make
With the functions that fake us out with fiction

Until we are twins
And everyone looks like my friends

We could be twins
Everyone looks all pretend

We could be twins
Everyone looks like my friends

Yeah we could be twins
Everyone looks so pretend

Yeah we could be twins
Everyone looks like my friends

And we could be twins
We could be twins"
two fingers,jethro tull,"I'll see you at the Weighing-In,
When your life's sum-total's made
And you set your wealth in Godly deeds
Against the sins you've laid.
And you place your final burden
On your hard-pressed next of kin:
Send the chamber-pot back down the line
To be filled up again.

And the hard-headed miracle worker
Who bathes his hands in blood,
Will welcome you to the final nod
And cover you with mud.
And he'll say, ""You really should make the deal,""
As he offers round the hat.
""You'd better lick two fingers clean
He'll thank you all for that.""
As you slip on the greasy platform,
And you land upon your back,
You make a wish and you wipe your nose upon the railway track.
While the high-strung locomotive,
With furnace burning bright,
Lumbers on
You wave goodbye
And the sparks fade into night.

And as you join the Good Ship Earth,
And you mingle with the dust
You'd better leave your underpants
With someone you can trust.
And when the Old Man with the telescope
Cuts the final strand
You'd better lick two fingers clean,
Before you shake his hand."

No, you will never see with virgin eyes again

He brings the metal to the fire for the first time
Tells you it's the last time and it will be

Wouldn't you agree running always slows you down?
So welcome the pain, stop yourself from delaying it
Cause the real life will never go away

I don't want to hear those lies, I'm sure
I've heard it all before

And you left me waiting so long,
I was waiting so long
I've been waiting so long

What if know this house alone each time I took you in
There's a sound that you make when you lie to my face, don't you know?
Tell my you've changed full to the game, I'm not the one you want
It's like my heart aches with each knock that you make, I was born to love alone

I don't want to hear you cry no more
Step inside the door
I don't want to hear those lies, I'm sure
I've heard it all before

And you left me waiting so long,
I was waiting so long
I've been waiting so long

Ooh it's undecided love
But you never believe me and maybe I know
Oh, honey, I know, it's undecided love
But you never believe and maybe I know
Honey I know, it's undecided love

Taking it away, you can't complain so every little blue I have
Gotta find a peace of mind when I look after the tear that's gone
Ooh, It's time to let you know
I don't want to hear you cry no more
Step inside the door
I don't want to hear those lies, I'm sure
I've heard it all before

And you left me waiting so long,
I was waiting so long
I've been waiting so long

Ooh it's undecided love
But you never believe me and maybe I know
Oh, honey, I know, it's undecided love
But you never believe and maybe I know
Honey I know, it's undecided love

under the surface,marit larsen,"It's such a funny sensation to be
So happy that you wanna die
Promises always were crazy to me
But never was I so surprised
Minutes are longer when we are apart
Your presence more than I can handle
It's come to the point were I wonder if I
Could ever be luckier when

Suddenly I
Back at the core
Thinking of her
Who had you before?
Where you as good
As good as we are?
Do you remember?

Did you love her

The way you love me?
Is there a chance that there might be
Traces of her
That you carry
Under the surface?
Lend me you ears

I would like to confess
I'm doubting that you can be real

By your side wearing a beautiful dress
I celebrate how good it feels
Say that you love me, say that it's true
I know that I want to believe you
But somehow silence speaks louder than words

I'm worried she's still on your mind
Suddenly I
Back at the core

Thinking of her
Who had you before?
Where you as good
As good as we are?

Do you remember?
Did you love her
The way you love me?
Is there a chance that there might be
Traces of her
That you carry
Under the surface?
I know that I'm selfish
I know that it's bad
I know but it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
Suddenly I
Back at the core
Thinking of her
Who had you before?
Were you as good
As good as we are?

Don't know how much more of this I can take
Baby, I'm under your spell

I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell

It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel

I'd like to help you but I'm in a bit of a jam
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am
Baby, caught between heaven and hell

But I will be back, I will survive
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive
Baby, can't you tell?

Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds
I'm starin' at your picture, I'm hearin' your words
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell

Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now

Turn back, baby, wipe your eyes
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye
Baby, is there anything left to tell?

I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head
Maybe next time, I'll let the dead bury the dead
Baby, what more can I tell?

Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed
Pray that I don't die of thirst
Baby, two feet from the well"

You want to love me

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately, you've been tryin' real hard
And givin' me your best, and
You give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had

It's not that bad

And you make me better, better, better

For real
'Cause underneath it all
You are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
Anytime you're around
My body keeps callin'
For your touch

Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's another side to you
And it's a human I adore
Aside from your temper
Everything else secure
Oh no, you're good for me baby
Of that, I'm a sure
'Cause over and over again
Me want more

You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness

So how could I let you go? Oh

Sometimes I listen to a voice that isn't mine
I disconnect from everything inside
And I have made choices
And wasted all the days
I could have been with you

To shout to someone

She said that someday
I'll find out someway
To shout to someone

One day she noticed her mum
At home all alone
Her head in her hands
She could not understand

She had worked all her whole life
To be a good wife
Now her husband had gone
Leaving her on her own

And how the water can flow like it's streaming out of fountains
And all you gotta do is find a sword and a stone

Like birds of paradise
Like way down in Pollyanna where the race runs wild

Oh, but if you're gonna leave
Better call the undertaker
Take me under, undertaker
Take me home

Oh, just place me in a box
And fasten all the locks
And with a one-two throw me over the bayside bridge

When it's treated like it should be
The sea goes on forever in a symphony of song

I'll make you scream, I'll make you laugh
Cover your body with my autograph

uneasy rider,the charlie daniels band,"I was takin' a trip out to L.A.
Toolin' along in my Cheverolet
Tokin' on a number and diggin' on the radio

Just as I crossed the Mississippi line
I heard that highway start to whine
And I knew that left rear tire was about to blow

Well the spare was flat and I got uptight
'Cause there wasn't a filling station in sight
So I just limped on down the shoulder on the rim

I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car
It was right in front of this little bar
Kind of a red-neck lookin' joint called the ""Dew Drop Inn""

Well I stuffed my hair up under my hat
And told the bartender that I had a flat
And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one

Well there was one thing I was sure proud to see
There wasn't a soul in the place except for him and me
And he just looked disgusted and pointed toward the telephone

I called up the station down the road a ways
And he said he wasn't very busy today
And he could have somone out there in just about ten minutes or so

He said, ""Now, you just stay right where yer at!""
And I didn't bother to tell the darn fool
That I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go

I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar
When some guy walked in and said, ""Who owns this car
With the peace sign, the mag wheels and four on the floor?""

Well he looked at me and I damn near died
And I decided that I'd just wait outside
So I laid a dollar on the bar and headed for the door

Just when I thought I'd get outta there with my skin
These five big dudes come strollin' in
With one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth

And I was almost to the door when the biggest one
Said, ""You tip your hat to this lady, son""
And when I did all that, hair fell out from underneath

Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight
In Jackson, Mississippi on a Saturday night
Especially when there was three of them and only one of me

They all started laughin' and I felt kinda sick
And I knew I better think of something pretty quick
So I just reached out and kicked old green teeth right in the knee

Now he let out a yell that'd curl yer hair
But before he could move, I grabbed me a chair
And said, ""Watch him folks 'cause he's a thoroughly dangerous man!""

""Well you may not know it but this man is a spy
He's a undercover agent for the FBI
And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan!""

He was still bent over holdin' on to his knee
But everybody else was looking and listening to me
And I laid it on thicker and heavier as I went

I said, ""Would you believe this man has gone as far
As tearing Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars
And he voted for George McGovern for President""

""But he's a friend of them long haired, hippy-type, pinko fags!
I betchya he's even got a commie flag
Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage""

""He's a snake in the grass, I tell ya guys
He may look dumb but that's just a disguise
He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage""

They all started lookin' real suspicious at him
He jumped up and said, ""Now just wait a minute Jim!
You know he's lying, I been living here all of my life!""

""I'm a faithful follower of Brother John Birch
And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church
And I ain't even got a garage, you can call home and ask my wife!""

Then he started saying somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed
But I didn't wait around to hear the rest
I was too busy moving and hoping I didn't run outta luck

When I hit the ground, I was making tracks
And they were just taking my car down off the jacks
So I threw the man a 20 and jumped in and fired that mother up

Mario Andretti would'a sure been proud
Of the way I was movin' when I passed that crowd
Coming out the door and headed toward me at a trot

Now I guess I should have gone ahead and run
But somehow I just couldn't resist the fun
Of chasing them all just once around the parking lot

Well they headed for their car, but I hit the gas
And spun around and headed them off at the pass
I was slingin' gravel and puttin' a ton of dust in the air

I had them all out there steppin' and fetchin'
Like their heads was on fire and their asses was catchin'
But I figured I had better go
And split before the cops got there

When I hit the road, I was really wheelin'
Had gravel flyin' and rubber squeelin'
And I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas

Well I think I'm gonna reroute my trip
I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped
If I went to L.A., via Omaha"

Yo, yo, yo... hold up man
Lets take it back to fundamentals, back to basics
Too many cats out there just rapping, running your trap
You lack the fundamentals, man
You trying to go all the way to Z
Forgot about A through X and Y, you know what I'm saying?
The Y is very important. We're gonna splash y'all like this

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We got beats... unlimited
Rhymes... unlimited
Styles... unlimited
Now that we got yaw listening'
Soul Position in the place to
Just two turntables and one emcee

People like my music, but say I talk too much
They used to say the same thing about Flag and Chuck
Every revolution starts with somebody loud
Somebody got to throw the first brick from the crowd
My momma used to tell me to speak my mind
So why would I change over beats and rhymes?
But some of ya'll change very LP
Now you gangster, you used to emcee
Or maybe you the art fag nose in the air
Or maybe you the double-time down-south player
I can't forget my abstract star track naggers
And fake battle rappers that only use written
Ill what you see when you watch it from a distance
And how many people out there are really hypocrites?
Anything different they dis it, but Soul Position
(Pause) still be keeping it exquisite

[Chorus]

I throw water on the crowd if the show ain't hot
Stage dive and don't care if you catch me or not
And make it look like I really meant to hit the floor
But when I'm laying on the ground I start spittin the raw
Even with a broken leg and a fractured collarbone
I won't let no other rapper touch my microphone
What ya'll motherfuckers laughin at
I'm trying to make sure my show stays action packed
Five dollars at the door get splashed with raps
Women pay two-fifty if that ass is fat
I ain't trippin', I'm trying to provide (?) some incentive
Decrease the hard (?), let's increase the women
Sometimes I write rhymes just to get girls naked
The only MC keeping it real enough to say it
So while you looking for the next jockstrap to play with
Me and RJ gon(na) be leaving with the girls that you came with

It's better left unsaid

Unsaid, said)

Pull the plug,
Don't resuscitate
Let it die quick, no drugs
Rather pain than lies,
We both will agree
We both disagree,
So let's agree,
Let's be free

Don't go on, go away
I've got no more words to say
End the song
No we can't go through the pain

Yeah you tried, take a break
If I'm wrong then that's ok
If you've got something to say
Too bad

Why you wanna kill me
With your lips
Won't you rather love me
With your kiss
I could be better
Without this Ohohoh, ohohohoh
Loving you used to
Be such bliss
If you give me hell
I will not miss
These, words,
They hurt ohhhhh

Don't go on, go away
I've got no more words to say

This girl is real - She's every schoolboy's dream

She fills my fantasies, my eyes and my ears
But every time I try to touch her - She dissappears

Oh oh oh oh oh She's untouchable
Oh oh oh oh oh untouchable delight
Oh oh oh oh oh She's untouchable
Oh oh oh oh oh She's outta- sight
In my mind I'm always with her - moans and sighs
I touch her full red lips - her silken thighs

We meet in the city, she begs: ""Please take me home""
But when I wake up in a cold sweat, I'm all alone"

You don't stand so tall
Better run, run, run put your armor on again

She is 12 years old
Nothing she don't know
She says you're 32 but you wanna be 16

I know that you did not receive
What it was that you needed when you were growing?
But tell me what's the worth?
You're repeating history verse by verse. What do you prove?
No matter what you say I think
You'll lose, you'll lose, you'll lose her

Up against the wall
You don't stand so tall
Better run, run, run put your armor on again

Isn't it time we recognized that we all live
Such broken lives sometimes
And it's sad but true that you still
Carry so much with you"
up all night,alex clare,"Waking up in someone else's bed
Was what I was waiting for
Oh my days, what have I done
She saw me sneaking out the door

What have I been waiting for
Been wasting all my time
Watching my youth slip away
Surely is a crime

And no, she don't know
What we do in our spare time
No, she don't know
That we've been up all night
All night, all night, all night

We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna
We gonna end up in the morning

We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna

Sun is up while I'm walking home
But my head's up in the clouds
Trying to get myself to bed

No she don't know that we've been up all night

upside down,barenaked ladies,"I'm not surprised it's come to this
Sooner or later there must be another's kiss
Behind that kiss a promise of a life of bliss
Yeah, great, I won't be taking the bait
I'd rather drown
And I will not turn my whole life upside down

Imagine everything you've done
Under a microscope on view for everyone
And if the king of circumspection's here
He's come in vain, I won't be sharing the blame
I'll wear the crown
And I will not turn my whole life upside down

Nothing's good enough for me
To shake me from complacency
I've made my mind up and I'll never be...

The kind of man to make a choice
For if I hold my tongue I'll never lose my voice
If each attempted act of sabotage destroys all hope
I won't be needing the rope
I'm gagged and bound
And I will not turn my whole life upside down

And if the genie was set free
And by the laws of things like that, he's indebted to me
I'd bury my three wishes deep down in the ground
So they will not turn my whole life upside down

Though I appreciate the aim
Tell Andy Warhol's ghost that he can keep his fame
I'd only use it to make everything the same again
So don't applaud 'til the end
When I'm not around, 'cause I will not turn my whole life upside down

Nothing's good enough for me
To shake me from complacency
I've made my mind up, I won't make a sound
And I will not turn my whole life upside down
I will not turn my whole life upside down"
us,brother ali,"I started rhyming just to be somebody
To make people notice me at the party
And not just be the new kid that's albino
Make 'em say yeah, I know but have you heard him rhyme though?

Now take that same party around the globe
And my stories connected with a lot of folks
I hope so 'cause that's the only thing I know
I know it so well, I tell it with my eyes closed

And I go with the feeling from the start
Blind in the eye so I see you with my heart
And to me all y'all look exactly the same
Fear faith, compassion and pain

And try as we may to mask it remains
Such as your religion or your past and your race
The same color blood just pass through our veins
And tears taste the same when they're splashing your face

The world's getting too small to stand in one place
It's like we're roommates just sharing a space
Can't separate and still carry the weight
Gotta heal, get away from the fear and the hate

Gotta shake free from the chains, you see what remains
Just a human being end of the day
Don't matter to me what name you gave your spiritual plane
Close your eyes and you'll see what I'm saying

I started rhyming just to be somebody
I found out that I already was
'Cause can't nobody be free unless we're all free
There's no me and no you, it's just us

Street preacher, what a fan once called me
I been called worse and tried to live up
Hope you don't mind a few more stories
I swear to God y'all, I tell 'em with love"

Rest without guilt
Not lie without fear
Disagree sans judgement

We would stay and respond
And expand and include

And enjoy and evolve
And discern and inquire
And accept and admit
And divulge and open

And amused by difference
Be gentle and make room
For every emotion

And know when to do which
We'd release and disarm
And stand up and feel safe

valentine's day,abc,"When the postman don't call on Valentine's Day
And Santa Claus don't come on a Christmas Day
That umbrella won't work on a rainy day
Don't ask me, I already know

When they find you beached on the barrier reef
And the only pleasure treasured is in map relief
The choice is yours, short; saint or thief
Don't ask me, I already know

Yes, they baked your cake in little slices
Kept your eye on rising prices
Wound up winning booby prizes
I'm sure you'd like to think you know what life is

Find destiny through magazines
Liplicking, unzipping, Harpers and Queens
From here to eternity without in-betweens
Ask me, I already know

With your heart on parade and your heart on parole
I hope you find a sucker to buy that mink stole
School for scandal, guess who's enrolled
So ask me, I already know

When they find you beached on the barrier reef
When the postman don't call on Valentine's Day
When the only pleasure treasured is in map relief
When you don't tell the truth, that's the price you pay

When I'm shaking a hand, I'm clenching a fist
If you gave me a pound for the moments I missed
And I got dancing lessons for all the lips I shoulda kissed
I'd be a millionaire, I'd be a Fred Astaire"
valentine,bryan ferry,"Tell me something I must know
The burning question why
Half a man is twice as much
When he's on the line

Happiness hard to get
Valentine in hand
None of them will ever guess
But you understand

How many men in a world of their own
There is no end to great unknown

Tell me something I must know
I'm outside looking in
Train of mirrors none so fair
Let the show begin

How many men in a world of their own
There is no end to great unknown

How many men in a world of their own
There is no end to great unknown"
valerie,brother firetribe,"The first time I saw you I couldn't believe
How you looked and how you played your part
You looked like an angel and I, just a stranger,
Was hooked by the second we talked
Almost tears in my eyes I just stared at your smile
How you lifted my spirit up high
Lost in the moment I stumbled and crawled
See I almost went out of my mind

Feeling you
Touching you

Was all I wanted to do
Before the night is over
I'm begging you please

Valerie
I get lost in your eyes
How I fall for your smile
It takes me away
So please won't you stay
Valerie
We've got night on our side
We can cross that line
Just take me away
Oh, please won't you stay

I said to myself only one thing's for sure
If I can't have you I'll probably die
Can't let you go, I won't let you go
You're way too good to be true
Then from fatal attraction to crucial distraction
You were gone in a blink of an eye
I couldn't believe, how this could be
No explanation, no goodbye

Feeling you
Touching you

Was all I wanted to do
But before the night was over
You were gone with the wind

Valerie
I get lost in your eyes
How I fall for your smile
It takes me away
So please won't you stay

We've got night on our side
We can cross that line
Just take me away

Freedom, oh yeah
Feel your sorrow

5: 35 and I'm living senseless
Just another homie picking on the defenceless
Don't request yet, nothing really to mention
Lookin through the mirror and I'm making a censure
Whoa, black people in the mall grease
Came around the corner and she caused me to freeze up
Ease up, watch how the world could tease us, ease us
But only G.O.D can please us
Hey, got my ride and my Momma's too
Show me how to roll without breakin the rules
Payin my dues, MC's droppin out choose
Decides to get with lyrical facts, don't stop
Whoa, black people dyin to shop
Everything is fine when you're losing your mind
I'm like a black alley cat, freestyle batter-up
Doesn't get better than that, is that a gat in the back?

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
And the Valkyrie's blood runs red through the halls of the dead
And the warrior's blood runs red through the hearts of the dead
And the Valkyrie's blood runs red through the halls of the dead
And the life you're been lookin for in the world that you live 2x
In the name, we were all born in the flame
Not the same, but under the moon on the desert plane
We roam, home, take the? coast ghost?
I saw with my naked eye, way to close now
I was the son of a man on a mission
Who worked with his hands and brought him the former land
In the inter-land, swingin the mic like an axe
With a fear in the atmosphere, layin down tracks

To light my way on such a very dark night
Dreams so real they grow wild on the vine

I've waited all day long to be with you, girl

We'll burn like falling stars tonight
And hide like vampires from the daylight
Until sundown

Remember how the coffee made us shake
On those long drives?
One more long night
Another seven days
Heartbeat racing the interstate, my home tonight
For one more long night
I'm sure as hell the happiest I've ever been
We can't hide, we let go
We've got more than we know
My friends are a different breed
My friends are
There's a ghost in this room
I think I'll name it after all of you
And watch it hang over my bed like decorations
Celebrated memories that came and went
In light of all that time we spent
Listening to everything our parents told us not to take in
Now make a change, I'm counting down
The mile marks to every town
And falling more in love
With the distance put between us
We can't hide, we let go
We've got more than we know
My friends are a different breed
My friends are everything
Make this last, take it slow
We've got it all figured out for now
So, let us live our lives without a doubt
Tonight we lie awake
Remember how the coffee made us shake
On those long drives?
One more long night
Another seven days
Heartbeat racing the interstate, my home tonight
For one more long night
From coast to coast I'll make the most
Of every second I've been giving with this crowd
Without a doubt, you're all I dream about
At night we lie awake
With stories taking us back
To the nights we felt alive
The nights we felt alive
I would've married you in Vegas
Had you given me the chance to say, ""I do""?
Couldn't make it anymore obvious, could you?
Be anymore obvious
I would've married you in Vegas
Had you given me the chance to say, ""I do""?
Couldn't make it anymore obvious, could you?
Be anymore obvious, could you?"

I'm not fearing any man!
I just wanna do God's will!

Peace? I'll sock you, Say somethin

[Mr. Solo:]
Uh, Not the .9, But vengeance is mine said the florida hopes
So I keep my peace while I keep prayin in the holy ghost
You'll get served if ya choose to be a tool
Pop said let a fool be a fool, Yeah
So I do, I'm not the one to run yo life
I tell you what it's like
Step up, Leave advice
And like Christ, When ya persecute, I stay silent
Ya call me names, Talk head, But don't get violent
I'll let you whoop and don't respond, Don't think I'm soft
Cause while I'm quiet, I'm prayin to keep from breakin you off
My homies known to break a chump that's passive
Cause you'll play em like a punk and Solo's passive
I stays humble and meek and walk in love, Holmes
I turn my cheek, You play me weak, We put the gloves on
Because I'm sick of the dissin and disrespect
Let alone sweat, I ain't the christian to try to jet
I hit the deck, It's like I'm sounding off a war call
He got the mic, Take ya life and the story all
So I don't gotta get violent when I rhyme
Or pack a .9 cause the battle ain't even mine

[Chille Chill:]
It's the gangsta, Givin the glory to God, I like to thank ya
Don't step to the ya bu gang so crew cause God'll have to spank ya
If ya soul ain't saved like Solo said, We have to gank ya
I pray but if you swing on Chill, Then Chill'll have to bank ya
Cause there'll be no destruction to my temple
So stay in place, So you can keep yo life simple
I got an angel down to strangle and entangle
If you slip, I trip, You slip cause he's equipped for the mangle

[Tik Tokk:]
Hope you don't think I'm bluffin or nothin
Step to me and i'll pray and God'll break you off somethin
I speak the word and watch God hoo-banger
It's not that I can't hang just no need to slang these thangs
Don't think I'm soft because I don't face suckers
I'm livin holy, It ain't like niggaz bustas

[Mr. Solo:]
Yeah, So don't get disrespectable
Yeah I'm a christian but yo chin is still checkable
To the break, Kid

Some think I'm soft just because I'm humble
Cool, Cause I don't get upset
Some think I'm soft, Soft, Just because cause cause I'm humble
Some call me the gangster of love
Well nigga, What you sayin?

[Mr. Solo:]
As for the spirit, Then my God is the filla
Mess wit his son, Then my God is a killa
I never look for trouble, But if somehow I finds it
I stands on the word and in Jesus name I bind it
See I don't wanna harm ya, So I'm tryin my best to warn ya
Don't step to the soldier cause I'm trained to use my armor

[Tik Tokk:]
As I Pursue ya

[Mr. Solo:]
Wit the grim in he step into ya
I plan to do ya
Wit the glory, glory, glory

[Tik Tokk:]
Hallelujah
I slays when I praise like a breeze
Through the trees and on my enemies I puts in work on my knees

[Mr. Solo:]
Steadily I keep walkin in the spirit to stay out the flesh
But people filled wit demons are just jealous put me to the test
I'm givin you 2 choices boss
Leave, Or you might get tossed
Get delivered by Christ cross or this white cross
I'm not sayin I'm strappin, cappin, or I'm packin
But if you think that christians is marks, Then Nathaniel happened
Check it

[Chille Chill:]
Since I'm a christian, Don't think that you can step, Y'all
Cause I can't lie, Sometimes I fall
And I might fall in sin wit yo chin
And when you fall, You get anointed by my size 10
No, No loc that's just Satan tryin to tempt me
He's tryin to make me fall in sin so he can pimp me
I know the battle ain't flesh and blood, So I pray
For God to give me the strength to make it to live so I can stay in love
Man, You betta pray about it

[samples and scratches:]
I live by the sword
Some think I'm soft just because I'm humble
Cool, Cause I don't get upset
Some think I'm soft just because I'm humble
Some call me the gangster of love

Think about that, Think about this
If I tryed to hit ya, Do ya think that I would miss?

vengeance,fgfc820,"Swirling all around you
Are the rumors people spread
Vicious lies that terrorize
And fill their swollen heads

They hide behind computer screens
Planning their attack
Smiling eyes disguise their lies
To stab you in the back

Don't back down
This is everything you've waited for
Stand your ground
And take what you deserve from life

Don't back down
This could be your last chance
Stand your ground
You gotta get up and fight

They'll tear you down to elevate
Themselves at any cost
Criticize, jeopardize
And celebrate your loss

When someone disrespects you
You don't have to turn away
A loaded fist, a rusty blade
Can help you dull the pain

venice,the books,"Maestro, as you paint this picture would you
Tell me what - what's going on
In your mind.
Now the cross, the mystical, vertical cross.
Out of black paint,
(... via con questo coso per... cortesia...)
A cros comes down from the top left hand
Side of the canvas.
(Via con quella testa per cortesia!)
He has just thrown a bunch of gold paint
Which has not only hit me in the face
(... ostia...)
But has gone across the canvas to the
Applause of the crowd below.
(... calma... aspetta... ahó aspetta cazoo, eh...
Adesso, aspetta!)
Now some black paint
(... giù con quella test! giù la testa nico... via
Via con quel coso lí porcoddio...)
This is the head, this is the head -
This is the head of the black death.
The canvas and the photographers are
Covered with paint.
I might add, its black paint and gold paint on
A white canvas.
(... un pochettino un pochettino! cosí cosí dai!
Pií in lá!)
(Crowd)
That was a - a big slash of paint.
What is this.
(Ah aaah ah ah (dialetto) è bellissimo? non
Va piè via... (dialetto) guarda,
No, no, no! Eeehh!)
Now he got even with the photographers who
Have been covering the canvas,
And opens the canvas and out comes twelve
Pigeons! Ha ha ha!
Twelve homing pigeons have just flown out of
The canvas.
Maestro, what are you doing?
(Applause)
You call this painting...
Le Lion de St. Mark.
The lion of St. Mark
Hommage à Venice.
Homage to Venice, the home (ha ha) of the
Lion of St. Mark."

Severin, Severin awaits you there

I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears

Kiss the boot of shiny, shiny leather
Shiny leather in the dark
Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Severin, Severin, speak so slightly
Severin, down on your bended knee
Taste the whip, in love not given lightly
Taste the whip, now bleed for me

I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears

Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart"

I could be from Mars
We would be together
Lovers forever
Care for each other

You could live in the sea
And I could be a bird
We would be together
Lovers forever
Care for each other

If you were an illusion
I would make it real
We would be together
Lovers forever
Care for each other

If you walk in the sun
I would be your shadow
We would be together
Lovers forever
Care for each other"

僕はこの世界の全てを知ってはいけない
たとえ君をなくしても

verona,geographer,"You call me all the right words
But the right words sound so wrong
You say that I'm changing
I guess I will before too long
Will you give me a way out or a past to live down?
Even when it couldn't be worse, it is now

I watch you while the wild door goes circles round and round
As every single whisper, no life that we should know by now
Is it just a sound
Something keeps a river from sinking to the ground
Was I ever any different?
It's the simplest of words
The simplest of words

White lies in the night
If I could be yours and you could be mine
As long as it rhymes
It's all that I'll ever need out here
White lies in the night
If I could be yours and you could be mine
We keep what we hide
You told such simple lies

Now that we are free, Verona, won't you keep me out?
Drive me to the city where every building shouts
I wanna hear some people
I wanna leave the windows down
I never would believe you
You should know why by now, whoa
And it's the simplest things we want, whoa
But we can never see enough, whoa
And it's the simplest things we want, whoa
And it's the simplest of words, the simplest of words

White lies in the night
If I could be yours and you could be mine
As long as it rhymes
It's all that I'll ever need out here
White lies in the night if I could be yours and you could be mine
We keep what we hide

And I'm climbing out
And i feel the danger
As I steal a kiss from your mouth

And I will try to hold steady
Wanna make you believe
That the height of this tightrope
Is just second nature to me

But I will break all my bones
'Cause I lied about the vertigo
And I have never been up this high
There'll be no safety net

When I fall right our of the sky
There will be no ambulance waiting
And I have no wings to fly

So we will meet on the borders
Barefoot and blessed
In colorful graveyards
With flower bouquets for the dead

And I don't ask you to promise
That I will not come to harm
But when the wind tugs my courage
Will you be my brother in arm?

Cause I will break all my bones
'Cause I lied about the vertigo
And I have never been up this high
There'll be no safety net

When I fall right our of the sky
There will be no ambulance waiting
And I have no wings to fly

Oh the view from this height
High above the ferriswheel lights
Might cause me to sway
But I am teaching myself to be brave

Cause I will break all my bones
'Cause I lied about the vertigo
And I have never been up this high
There'll be no safety net

When I fall right our of the sky
There will be no ambulance waiting
And I have no wings to fly"

Every day I play the victim
Brought down by brutality
I've fallen out of favor
I'm cursed by locality

I feel it getting worse now
I'm afraid of what I see
The world has let me down
Look what it's done to me

This is my last confession

Am I the only one?

This is my lone obsession
Try so hard to make it hurt less
Save myself from self-deception
I always fail, because I'm worthless"

virus,abney park,"It feeds on the souls of the living.
It gets inside their minds.
It transforms their brains and their longings,
No consciousness it will find.

It feeds on their fears and emotions,
As it has for 2000 years.
It's infected the Hindus, infected the Buddhists,
And kept them all in tears.

If you're dead, it will keep you alive.
And if you're alive, it keeps you nearly dead.
It forces the body to seek uninfected,
And gets inside their heads.

Once your brain is infected,
It changes what makes you pleased.
It forces your body to seek uninfected,
And add them to the diseased.

In this way it creeps slowly
All across the lands.
But the wise and the strong can still join forces,
Defending our last stand

If you're dead, it will keep you alive.
And if you're alive, it keeps you nearly dead.
It forces the body to seek the uninfected,
And gets inside their heads."

Since we held hands out in the rain
Smoking cigarettes to play
Off all the butterflies I had inside
And now I think that you should know
That you've got everything
That I've wanted for so damn long
And that I wouldn't hesitate to trade away everything
If you tell me that I'm not wrong
So know I think that you should know
That I've been waiting for you
Since we sat underneath the stars
As I held you in my arms
Killing just another summer night
It's funny how the best things happen sometimes
And how I'll always remember those endless nights
But don't forget I regret the fact that I have to leave you
Right as the best part starts
So I thought I'd take the time to say"

'Cos time and time again
We feel the load a little more
But if you let yourself go
Then we won't hit that road

'Cos I can see the sky
But it's yours to be seen
If you can be with someone else
If you can let yourself go
If you can let yourself

But is this the time
Is this the place
And is this the end
Is all I can say
I promise I never meant to turn you away
Why did you trust me with your heart

So consider the things
From the pain that it brings
Down to the things you miss the most
And if you let yourself go
Well the next thing you know
I have seen this guy
And he's looking at me
Yeah and he thinks I'm something else
So you can walk yourself home
Yeah you can go

Even though you waited
I know that you can begin on your own
You can begin on your own

But is this the time
Is this the place
And is this the end
Is all I can say
I promise I never meant to turn you away
Why did you trust me with your heart

I promise that I never meant to turn you away
Why did you trust me with your heart"
wait,alexi murdoch,"Feel I'm on the verge of some greath truth
Where I'm finally in my place
But I'm fumbling still for proof
And it's cluttering my space

Casting shadows on my face
I know I have the strength to move a hill
But I can hardly leave my room
So I'll sit here perfecty still
And I'll listen for a tune
When the mind is on the moon

And if I stumble
And if I stall
And if I slip now
And if I should fall
And if I can't be all that I could be
Will you, will you wait for me?

'Cause everywhere I seem to be
I am only passing through
I dream these days about the sea
Always wake up feeling blue
Wishing I could dream of you

So if I stumble
And if I fall
And if I slip now
And loose it all
And if I can't be all that I could be
Will you, will you wait for me?

And wait for me
And wait for me
And wait for me
Won't you wait for me?

And wait for me
Please wait for me
Please wait for me
Won't you wait for me?

And wait for me
Please wait for me
Please wait for me
Won't you wait for me?

Please wait for me
Please wait for me
Won't you wait for me?

Please wait for me
Please wait for me
Won't you wait for me?

Please wait for me

Won't you wait for me?"
wake me up,aloe blacc,"Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end

They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older

Didn't know I was lost

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans

Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is a prize

waking life,schuyler fisk,"Waking Life
There's an anchor that's pulling on my heart,
And it's deep in the water but it can't take me down.
Tracin' faces with fingers and we're just the same as we were,
Just our eyes never found what I see now,
That my feet are on the ground.
Chorus:

Cause I'm not lost, just looking for footprints.
I'm taking it, one step at a time and I'm getting by.
By the way,
It's you on my mind,
It's you on my mind.
And here comes the night pulling puppet strings on my heart again,
Shows me all of this time I've been blind to this waking life.
Now I... see it everywhere.
Chorus:

Cause I'm not lost, just looking for footprints,
Yeah.
And I'm takin it, one day at a time and I'm gettin by.
By the way.
You're still on my mind,
You're still on my mind.
I... can't... see... you but I know you're here,
I, know you're here.

walk alone,the roots,"Trapped, no shield, no sword
The unbeaten path got my soul so sore
Allured by the lust, something money can't cure
The Devil want me as is, but God, He want more

Eyes closed, eyes open, great another day, here we go
Like a nigga woke up late in The Truman Show
Livin' life without a care, mean poker face
But I'm forced to play solitaire 'til I get up out of here

Move like a wanted man with a bounty on his head
Work alone, sleep alone, eat alone, daily bread
Countin' till my fingers' red, how you gon' judge a man
Walkin' in the shoes of a man with a broken leg?

Flame on the trail headed for the powder keg
Last place in the race I ain't never led
Like I ain't never bled, time to get up out of bed
Servin' in the army of one, it's on again

Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walkin' alone

Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walkin' alone

I'm in a chess match, I'm in a death trap
I'm tryin' to find out where the eggs in the nest at
I'm one blood when the sky turns jet black
No love in the world can correct that

I'm in a slow lane, I'm on my Cobain
I'm in the new spot tryin' to run a old game
I got a new chick, put out my old flame
No peace, no sleep, no love for a young beast

You can put me in a cage
You can put me in the jungle where the lion get blazed
There ain't no hell like the hell I raise
I'd die in the bed I made 'fore I lay with a love I loathe

I'm a snake in the garden of bones
I'm a loner in a world of clones
I'm the piece that don't belong, see I roam
Where the the Reaper roam 'til they put my name on a stone

Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walkin' alone

Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walkin' alone

The longest walk I'll probably ever be on
The Road to Perdition, guess I'm finna get my plea on
I pray these wings strong enough to carry me on
I promise every second felt as if it took an eon

Walkin' like the lost boys of Sierra Leone
The trail of tears what they got me like a Cherokee on
Between the ears somethin' I require therapy on
For the workin' to the bone like my name Robert Dion

I go above and beyond, the duty called, truly y'all
Even though they kind of blew me off like a booty call
Asked me if I'm just another muli or a movie star
Forced to face the music like a graduate of Juilliard

Walk alone, talk alone, get my Charlie Parker on
Make my mark alone, shed light upon the dark alone
Get my sparkle on, it's a mission I'm embarkin' on
A kamikaze in the danger zone far from home

Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walkin' alone

Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I was born"
walk away,amity dry,"You know there's been some good times
There's been some rain
but for it all I'm greatful
There's nothing I will change
I'll keep it lock forever
Here in my mind but
We both know that baby this is time

CHORUS
I'm just trying to walk away
I dont want to hurt no more
And I'm going to if I stay
Can't you make it easier on me
Don't you try to change my mind
Let me walk away

I can still remember
How it use to be
And there was a time
when loving you came easy
But we got lost in our separate lives
And love walked away
So now i've got to try

Chorus

It's hard enought
Trying to leave you now
So dont stand in my way
Cause you'll break me down
Know that I know this is right
Let me go without a fight

Chorus"
walk this way,macy gray,"Backstroke lover always hiding 'neath the cover
""Still I talked to your daddy,"" he said
He said you ain't seen nothing
'Til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be changing your ways

I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I can reminisce
'Cause the best thing loving
Was his sister and his cousin
Only started with a little kiss, I like this

(Walk this way), talk this way, he told me to
(Walk this way), talk this way, he told me to
(Walk this way), talk this way, he told me to
(Walk this way), just gimme a kiss like this
Mmm, just gimme a kiss

See-saw swinging with the girls in the school
And your feet flying up in the air
Singing hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you just don't care

So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a mister who was ready to play
Was it me he was fooling
'Cause he knew what he was doing
And I know love was here to stay
He told me to

(Walk this way) yeah, talk this way, he told me to
(Walk this way), talk this way, he told me to
(Walk this way), walk this way, yeah, talk this way
(Walk this way), talk this way, just gimme a kiss
Like this

School boy sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little short hanging down your knee
There were three young honeys in the school gym locker
When I noticed they were lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a honey
'Til the girls told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a son had a favor
So I gave him just a little kiss (hmm, like this)

(Walk this way), talk this way, he told me to
(Walk this way), talk this way, he told me to
(Walk this way) yeah, talk this way, he told me to
(Walk this way), yay, walk this way, yeah!
Just gimme a kiss

walk with me,joe budden,"Come and take a walk with me
I need all of y'all to come and take a walk with me
I need for all of y'all to feel what im goin' through
And see what I see, if u got time then take a walk with me
Wait a minute [now], shit aint like I thought it would be
Come to jersey from new york with me, I know ur busy
But take the time out to walk with me
Pay attention on this tour with me, maybe im seeing something wrong
Come along and make sure with me, come and take a short walk with me

I'm seeing a couple things wrong with the way that im living
So come and walk with me I just need a second opinion
I'll introduce u to my friends, I gotta see if u notice
If they loyal or if they all got an alterior motive
They some snake Niggas, me and them don't deal anymore
Ever since I got signed I don't know whats real anymore
Im paranoid so excuse me if I seem to be nervous
But everybody from my past now they trying to resurface
Trying to rekindle, they don't think i know they go limo
I got cousins I never knew they trying to pass me they demo
Maybe im wrong like I told u man I need g' ya opinion
Me and them never spoke before so I don't see whats so different
Dudes I don't know they recognize me start extending they hand
And I m trippin ready for beef when he was only a fan (why)
Cuz these Niggas in my hood say they don't like how im reppin
Let me know how strongly u feel, will I be needing my weapon
As some sort of protection
Should I carry a pen and pad and ask everybody in the fuckin hood for they suggestions
Im letting the labels know that jersey city is gifted
When they aint no that jersey city existed
But its cool y'all
Certain cats in jersey city so hateful, and certain cats in jersey city aint grateful
All they say is I don't chill anymore n ever since I got signed they don't think im real anymore
Im told I shouldn't be alone cuz im a star in my hood
""Sumthing might happen mouse, they know who u are in the hood"", (they do)
So I cant tell u how I feel anymore
N ever since I got signed I cant tell whats real anymore

Come and take a walk with me
I need all of y'all to come and take a walk with me
I need for all of y'all to feel what im goin' through
And see what I see, if u got time then take a walk with me
Wait a minute [now], shit aint like I thought it would be
Come to jersey from new york with me, I know ur busy
But take the time out to walk with me
Pay attention on this tour with me, maybe im seeing something wrong
Come along and make sure with me, come and take a short walk with me

See to me is heavy, but to u it may seem petty
Lets continue walking I know u aint tired already
I'll take u to meet my girl I gotta see if u notice
If she love me or if the bitch got an alterior motive
Why am I hated cuz I handle my business
Aint gotta look for a girl now a days cuz almost all these Niggas is bitches
See im often while we walking ill show u the drug dealers
And some dudes that hate me, word on the street's is they real killers (dog)
Where was the hate back when I wasn't on my feet
A alcoholic, school dropout, just a bum on the street
Where was the hate durin my adolescence
Back when that physicatrist was trying hard to get me on them anti-depressants (o man)
I don't recall none of this happenin' back then
And I don't understand I was still rappin back then
So I gotta ride with a gun for trying to get my mom and pop up outa the slums
And provide for my son
If u met my baby moms would u notice if she was ready for a child
Or if her ass had an alterior motive
I don't know what she's teaching Trey, but every day he get older
Angie's bitter and feel like now that im successful I owe her
Cuz she would hold me so tight when I was ready to relapse
Tell me to relax, I aint know no better straight outa rehab
Bottom line I was lonesome, but we was grown for each other
Angie I grown some, got bigger issues
If u went to Def Jam would u notice if they was out for my best interest
Or do they just see a dollar in Joeseph
Guess I aint sure how I feel anymore ever since I got signed I cant tell whats real anymore
I mean them same record execs. That wanted me in
Don't care that im the next nigga they just wanna see spends (I swear)
Guess I aint sure how I feel anymore ever since I got signed I cant tell whats real anymore
U feeling me, dog

Come and take a walk with me
I need all of y'all to come and take a walk with me
I need for all of y'all to feel what im goin' through
And see what I see, if u got time then take a walk with me
Wait a minute [now], shit aint like I thought it would be
Come to jersey from new york with me, I know ur busy
But take the time out to walk with me
Pay attention on this tour with me, maybe im seeing something wrong
Come along and make sure with me, come and take a short walk with me"

walking away,lifehouse,"The sun goes down
As the city lights
Pave their way through the darkest night
Raindrops fall
As an old man cries
Never thought to ever think twice

Of all he had
Of all he lost
A selfish life
I guess comes with the cost

Hey
Remember me
I remember you walking away

Hey
Remember me
I remember you walking away

The same old streets
Just a different name
Same old house
Just the family's changed
Picket fence
The windows stained
Freedom spelled
By a man in chains

Silence is all we have to give
And the memories of a life
I wish we'd lived

Hey
Remember me
I remember you walking away

Hey
Remember me
I remember you walking away

From all that you made
That you lost
Or threw away
Traded in for a brand new life
But I can't
Can't let go
Can't turn around
Hold my head high and walk away

Hey
Remember me
I remember you walking away

Hey
Remember me
I remember you walking away"

wandering,the hidden cameras,"I had this feeling of life
Wandering
Through the field of an island
I'll be wondering
If it's a dream I'll be wise to
Keep slumbering
Oh to be filled up with life
And be wandering
Through the streets I will find
I'll be wondering
If it's a joke I will laugh
Or just break down?

I couldn't be the one to follow
I couldn't if I tried
Following the aimless calling
Miracle conspires
To chase, in waster, an answer, folly!
Answer me reply!
I've already decided that

This feeling is mine
I'll be wandering
Through the streets I will find
It's best to be wandering
Even if I can't find
What I think is the light
I have this weakness to find
Or at least wander

I wouldn't have the need to follow
Anyone's advice
Navigating, edges fraying
Take me in the light
I wouldn't be denied because

In a dream I will find you
It's a wonder
I'll feel the need to confide
With only my eyes
Oh to be filled up with life
And be wandering"

Falling right out of your sky

Between no longer and not yet
On the threshold of some bright affair
The match was struck and I was fire
The embers of a drowning man

Tell me, why won't I listen
Or acknowledge that I don't understand?
Losing light, a selfish kind
And we're out on the road again

It's given us, yeah, this wonderful wanderlust
It's given us this wonderful wanderlust
It's given us this wonderful wanderlust
I don't doubt it, I feel it, yeah

Turn the headlights on full
I wanna take in it all and let it wash over me
The bridge looked so high from the banks that we climbed
But we climbed them so that we could be free
Give me no dreams of what the future brings
I need to know when I have gone too far, oh

Repeated lightning strikes up and down the spine
They search us out wherever we go
In a world full of lies that tug at the truth
I'm taking no sides, now I recognize you

Rubbing on your leg
Slide a little further up

From our sleep
Like a bolt from the blue?
Will we realise?

If they found a tube in outer space
And no-one knew who put it there.
If they looked inside and
Found out they'd lived lonely lives,
Followed by a lonesome death
They sent it hoping we would learn
They blew it here with their final breath.
They made a list of their mistakes-
It looked a lot like ours.
If it happened, do you think we'd learn?
Do you think we'd learn?

Will we rise
From our sleep
Like a bolt from the blue?
Will we realise?

If they knew how to talk through space,
And we received a warning call
Do you think we'd learn?
Would it be in vain?
Do you think we'd learn?

Like they did on earth."
wash away,matt costa,"Float down stream, rivers of dreams

Heavens high, so you fly
Catch your dreams in the sky

But the glaciers have frozen your feet
I can't wait for eternity
And so you watched me wash away
But maybe we'll catch up someday
Maybe well catch up someday

Sun sinks out of view
Stars they shine changing hue

But bright lights have blinded your sights
They cant adjust when day turns to night
And so you watched me wash away
But maybe well catch up someday

The castles we built were so tall
They only left us further to fall
And still I see them far away
But maybe we'll come back someday
Maybe we'll come back someday

Float down stream, rivers of dreams
Float down stream, catch your wings

The castles we built were so tall
They only left us further to fall
And still I see them far away
Maybe well come back someday

The castles we built were so tall
They only left us further to fall
And still I see them far away
As I watch them wash away
Wash away...
Wash away...
Wash away...

About what you've done

And you feel so disconnected
But there's no use for crying
Just live for today

And it's just a waste of time
If you don't know what's on your mind
And it won't be better
No matter how you try

There will be a morning
And your fears will be gone
When you wake up laughing
You'll have another day

And it's just a waste of time
If you don't know what's on your mind
And it won't be better
No matter how you try"

wasted years,maroon 5,"Slow is the memory
And I can picture her standin' right in front of me
Said that I'm behaving badly
And kind of driving her crazy
But I know she wants me

I remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane
And sitting on top of me, yelling out my fucking name
Until I'm empty
But I know she wants me

But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry

Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else's tears
You let me down now I'm hanging you out to dry

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax, you know you want me

All the time and everywhere
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear

But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry

Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else's tears
Let me down now I'm hanging you out to dry

'Cause sometimes I don't know what to do
I'm scared to stand right in front of you
And pray our pain subsides
Can't bear the stare of your teary eyes

I know you feel like it's hard to stay
In fact you may just wanna run away
Now all that I can really say is baby oh
Deep down you know, yeah

But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else

To sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow
Wish I was back in the city
Instead of this old bank of sand
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
And the one I love so close at hand
If I had wings and I could fly
I know where I would go
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly
And watch the river flow
People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah
Makes you stop and all wonder why
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
Who just couldn't help but cry
Oh, this ol' river keeps on rollin', though
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does I'll just sit here

And Brando on the ice

With one more way he can't play this scene twice

And all the skid kids saw a very, very proud man
And he entwine her in his finger
And she lay there like a baby in his hand
And climb upon the rooftop docks lookin' out on the crosstown seas
And he wraps his jacket across her shoulders
And he falls and hugs and holds her on his knees
But a sailor just takes a broad down to the dark end of the fair
To turn her into a tattoo
That will whisper
Into the back of Johnny's black hair
And now Johnny the King walks these streets without her in the rain
Lookin' for a leather jacket
And a girl who wrote her name forever
A promise that ---
We belong together
We belong together

Shall we weigh along these streets
Young lions on the lam?
Are the signs you hid deep in your heart
All left on neon for them?
Who are foolish
Who are victim
Of the sailors and the ducky boys who would
Move into your eyes and lips and
Every tear
That falls down on the neighborhood now
I said ""Bird, we just gotta tell them""
And they turn and ignore us
And the only heroes we got left
Are written right before us
And the only angel who sees us now
Watches through each other's eyes
And I can hear him
In every footstep's passing sigh
He goes crazy these nights
Watching heartbeats go by...
And they wisper ---

we've come a long way,good old war,"I thought I'd learn to behave
But I don't feel I'm acting my age
Once in a while
And though things may not be the same
You helped me feel no pain
All of my life
I wanted to say to you
We've come a long, long way
There's so much to say
Still have a long, long way

You've seen me at my worst
And I've seen you in the reverse
We are equal
And no matter what happens from here
No matter where life ends, my dear
I will be grateful
I wanted to say to you
We've come a long, long way
There's so much to say
We've come a long, long way"
weakness,everlast,"Met a fine red boned mami
She told me that her name was Lucille
Met her on Fountain Avenue
Sitting on a Cadillac Coupe De Ville

She said, I'm a liar, a thief, a junkie
And I used to be a whore
And I've been trying to shake this monkey
So long, I just can't take it no more

I got a weakness
I got a hunger, I got a jones
I'm sick and I need to get well
I hurt deep in my bone

I got a weakness
I got a fever, I got a thirst
I'm sitting on the edge of the bubble
Just waiting for it to burst

We talked all afternoon
She made me cry, I told some jokes
She looked me deep in my eyes
And told me love was nothing but a cruel hoax

Her grandmother died when she was five
And she never did know her folks
Her father fell in a gun fight
And her mother by an overdose

I got a weakness
I got a hunger, I got a jones
I'm sick and I need to get well
I hurt deep in my bones

I got a weakness
I got a fever, I got a thirst
I'm sitting on the edge of the bubble
Just waiting for it to burst

She said, I've slept with gangsters
Thugs and smugglers, congressman and governors
I've seen therapists and holy men
But this weakness is my only friend

It feeds my need, it numbs my soul
It starts to creep and take control
I sell my flesh, I pierce my skin
And tomorrow I'ma do it all again

'Cause I got a weakness
I got a hunger, I got a jones
I'm sick and I need to get well
I hurt deep in my bones

I got a weakness
I got a fever, I got a thirst
I'm sitting on the edge of the bubble
Just waiting for it to burst"
weightless,all time low,"Manage me, I'm a mess
Turn a page, I'm a book half unread
I wanna be laughed at
Laughed with just because

I wanna feel weightless
And that should be enough
But I'm stuck in this fucking rut
Waiting on a secondhand pick-me-up

And I'm over getting older
If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over getting old

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere

And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

Make believe that I impress
That every word by design turns a head
I wanna feel reckless
Wanna live it up just because

I wanna feel weightless
'Cause that would be enough
If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over getting old

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere

And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

This could be all that I've waited for
(I've waited, I've waited for)
And this could be everything
I don't wanna dream anymore

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I've been going crazy
I'm stuck in here

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year

While the minutes pass as I go nowhere

To everything I fear

welcome home,coheed and cambria,"You could've been all I wanted
But you weren't honest
Now get in the ground
You choked off the surest of favors
But if you really loved me
You would've endured my world

Well, if you're just as I presumed
A whore in sheep's clothing
Fucking up all I do
Yeah, and if so, here we stop
Then never again
Will you see this in your life

Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion
You seem to take premise to all of these songs

You stormed off to scar the armada
Like Jesus played letter
I'll drill through your hands
The stone for the curse you have blamed me
With love and devotion, I'll die as you sleep

But if you could just write me out
To neverless wonder... happy will I become
Be true that this is no option
So with sin I condemn you
Demon play, demon out!

Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion
You seem to take premise to all of these songs

One last kiss for you
One more wish to you
Please make up your mind girl...
I'd do anything for you

One last kiss for you
One more wish to you
Please make up your mind girl...
Before I hope you die"

werewolf,cat power,"Oh the werewolf, oh the werewolf
Comes stepping along
He don't even break the branches where he's gone
Once I saw him in the moonlight, when the bats were a flying
I saw the werewolf, and the werewolf was crying
Cryin' nobody knows, nobody knows, body knows
How I loved the man, as I teared off his clothes.
Cryin' nobody know, nobody knows my pain
When I see that it's risen; that fool moon again
For the werewolf, for the werewolf has sympathy
For the werewolf, somebody like you and me.
And only he goes to me, man this little flute I play.
All through the night, until the light of day, and we are doomed to play.
For the werewolf, for the werewolf, has sympathy
For the werewolf, somebody like you and me."

Walking through the streets of Soho in the rain.
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook's,
Going to get a big dish of beef chow mein.

You better not let him in.
Little old lady got mutilated late last night,
Werewolves of London again.

He's the hairy handed gent who ran amok in Kent,
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair.
You better stay away from him,
He'll rip your lungs out, Jim,
Huh! I'd like to meet his tailor.
Ahhwooooo... Werewolves of London, Ahwooooo!
Ahhwooooo... Werewolves of London, Ahwooooo!

Well, I saw Lon Chaney walking with the Queen,
Doing the Werewolves of London.
I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. walking with the Queen,
Doing the Werewolves of London.
I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's,
And his hair was perfect.

Do I let her sleep or should I wake her up?

Have got yourself to keep you warm

To be constantly a part of you
You'll never part and you will be
The party who will be partial to you

Propellers spinning from the tree
Rhododendron evergreen
Look within and you will see
There's another deep inside you
And inside the other one there is another in the other

Think it over
No need to answer right away
I'll be over
There in the state across the way

That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then, and just let 'em out

I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while even though
Going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again
I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away

And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doing it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends
And I'm alone

Still harder getting up, getting dressed, living with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Is being so close
And having so much to say (much to say)
And watching you walk away

And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that loe in you

The microphone fienin, for a microphone
Before he knew what a microphone mean

Will soon know the music he wrote, it was so true
Who could raise me, after I been amazed by Dre
And N.W.A., and you couldn't pay me
To back the staff for free, I will believe
It ain't nothing Shady in the Aftermath

Like that made me gauge, White, Black, hate to make
Me say - I like, when they fight back, they
Meaning rap, I vent myself
Leanin back, not knowin that I meant myself
A lesson comin fast, you dudes better catch it
Whenever the future answers ya questions from the past
And hold that, I'm spillin these cold raps
Cause I am a throwback you feeling a soldier
And keep tryin, to keep up wit the kind of guy
That'll play you until they fatally say that the game's over

Goin from makin them poems up, in my garage
Then goin on major tours wit, me and my squad
Goin from listenin to Reggie, to meeting him
Wit my palms sweaty, to him, telling me - I'm deadly
Goin from likin, to spray the club after a night
That didn't go my way, to plug a writin for Dre
You damn right I was raised, the amazin
Hand-writin on the same page, that you can't type on

I don't own emotion
I rent

For once, the shadows gave way to light (for once, the shadows gave way to light)
For once, I didn't disengage

Meine Hobbys sind, ähm, schubsen oder Beine stellen
Oder hin und wieder bisschen faul auf 'ner Couch
Manchmal allein und manchmal mit Frauen
Doch heut bin ich im Club, ich komme noch nicht heim
Wir feiern durch die Nacht, bis die Sonne wieder scheint

Bye, bye, ich fühl mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Und mir ist scheißegal, was morgen kommt
Ich heb mein Glas und schrei
Bye, bye, ich fühl mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Und mir ist scheißegal, was morgen kommt
Ich heb mein Glas und schrei

Ich wache auf, schaue raus, kein'n Plan wo ich bin
Das ganze Haus voller Frauen, die schlafen bestimmt
Meine Hose ist zerrissen und der Wagen ist hin
Geh in die Küche, mach mir erst einmal 'nen Kaffee mit Jim
Setz mich hin, WhatsApp, ""Was geht, bin hier
Und leb, doch geh demnächst zu dir
Okay, und falls irgendjemand schon weiß
Was heute Abend geht, dann bitte, bitte gebt mir Bescheid""
Denn ich bin irgendwie im Modus, deshalb will ich nicht heim
Probleme lös ich locker mit 'nem billigen Wein
Gib mir noch 'n Schluck, noch 'n Schluck, noch 'n Schluck, noch 'n Schluck
Noch 'n Schluck, jap, ich bin daba-daba-dai
Also gib, gib, gib, gib, gib mir 'n Becks
Und ich kipp, kipp, kipp, kipp, kipp es auf Ex
Deine Gang, 'n paar Kids mit Clique auf der Cap
Hab'n den Whiskey gegrabbt und verpissen sich jetzt

Bye, bye, ich fühl mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Und mir ist scheißegal, was morgen kommt
Ich heb mein Glas und schreie
Bye, bye, ich fühl mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Und mir ist scheißegal, was morgen kommt
Ich heb mein Glas und schrei
Bye, bye, ich fühl mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Und mir ist scheißegal, was morgen kommt
Ich heb mein Glas und schreie
Bye, bye, ich fühl mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Und mir ist scheißegal, was morgen kommt
Ich heb mein Glas"
wheel,john mayer,"People have the right to fly
And will when it gets compromised
Their hearts say, ""Move along""
Their minds say, ""Gotcha heart
Let's move it along""

And airports see it all the time
Where someone's last goodbye
Blends in with someone's sigh
Cause someone's coming home
In hand a single rose

And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And I won't be the last
No, I won't be the last
To love her

You can't build a house of leaves
And live like it's an evergreen
It's just a season thing
It's just this thing the seasons do

And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And you won't be the first
No, you won't be the first
To love me

You can find me
If you ever want again
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around
I'll be around

And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
You just might find if you give it time, you will wave hello again
You just might wave hello again

And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now

You can't love too much one part of it
You can't love too much one part of it

I believe that my life's gonna see
The love I give returned to me"
when doves cry,prince & the revolution,"Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling
Can you picture this?
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold. (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father - too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied. (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like

When doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up

Don't make me chase you...
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold, (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father - too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied. (She's never satisfied)

Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding, (Maybe, maybe I'm like my father)
Maybe I'm just like my father – too bold (Ya, know he's to bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other? (Why do we scream, why?)
This is what it sounds like

When doves cry.
When doves cry. (Doves cry, doves cry)
When doves cry. (Doves cry, doves cry)"
when i go,slow club,"If we're both not married by twenty-two
Could I be so bold and ask you?
If we're both not married by twenty-three
Will you make my year, and ask me?

If we're both not married by twenty-four
Will you pass me those knee pads and I'll get on the floor
If we're both not married by twenty-five
I hope that there's some childish spark still alive

Cause there are so many lessons
That I just never cared to learn
And there are so many questions that still burn

Like: Will you hold my hand when I go?
Will you hold my hand when I go?
Will you hold my hand when I go?
Will you hold my hand when I go?

If I get to thirty and I don't have a wife
I'll ask you nicely but I won't ask twice
If I get to forty and I don't have a spouse
I'll fashion you a letter and I'll send it to your house

If I get to sixty will you let me slip away
Into an armchair for the rest of my days
Cos you've got your family and I've got mine
The love that we share is for another time

Cause there are so many lessons
That I just never cared to learn
And there are so many questions that still burn,
Like: Will you hold my hand when I go?
Will you hold my hand when I go?
Will you hold my hand when I go?
Will you hold my hand when I go?"
when i grow up,mayday parade,"Boys call you sexy (What's up, sexy)
And you don't care what they say
See, every time you turn around
They screamin' your name
Now I've got a confession
When I was young I wanted attention
And I promised myself that I'd do anything
Anything at all for them to notice me
But I ain't complaining
We all wanna be famous
So go ahead and say what you wanna say
You know what it's like to be nameless
Want them to know what your name is
'Cause see when I was younger I would say
When I grow up

I wanna be in movies
When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it (Get it?)
They used to tell me I was silly
Until I popped up on the TV
I always wanted to be a superstar
And knew that singing songs would get me this far
But I ain't complaining
We all wanna be famous
So go ahead and say what you wanna say
You know what it's like to be nameless

Oh I'm a trendsetter
Yes this is true 'cause what I do, no one can do it better
You can talk about me
'Cause I'm a hot topic

when i'm gone,eminem,"Yo, it's my life, my own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much
You'd give an arm for
Not the expression, no
Literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
""Daddy look what I made""
""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy where's mommy?
I can't find mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself""
I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me
But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream
I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'""
""Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
""Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""you got one more chance to do right
And it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'""
But baby we're in Sweden
How did you get to Sweden?
I followed you daddy
You told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
""I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'""
""But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice
Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us
That's what they want
They want you, Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!
You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real
I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground
Cock it, put it to my brain, scream Die Shady! and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up
Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back"
when no one cares,junior boys,"When no one cares
And the phone never rings
The nights are endless things

You're like a child that cries
And no one heeds the crying
You're like a star that dies
And seems to keep on dying

When no one cares
You count souvenirs
And they glisten with your tears

You can't believe a love like hers
Could come from someone new

When no one cares but you
When no one cares but you
When no one cares but you"
when the saints go marching in,fats domino,"Oh when the saints go marching in when the saints go marching in
Oh Lord I want to be in that number when the saints go marching in

Oh when the stars begin to fall when the stars begin to fall
Oh Lord I want to be in that number when the stars begin to fall

Oh when the saints...

Oh when they crown him Lord of all when they crown him Lord of all
Oh Lord I want to be in that number when they crown him Lord of all

Oh when the saints..."
when you believe,michelle pfeiffer & sally dworsky,"Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proved in vain
Hope seemed like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet, now I'm standing here (now I'm standing here)
With heart so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

אשירה על אדוני, כי גאה גאה
אשירה על אדוני, כי גאה גאה
מי כמכה, באלים, אדוני?
מי כמכה נאדר בקודש?

when you go out,i love you but i've chosen darkness,"When you're going out
When I'm staying in
Keep your head above
Head above water

You could start again
Keep your head above
We don't want each other
We don't want our love

Start from one and two
Count from one to five
We can't change this feeling
We can't change this time

Learn to, learn to trust
Let no one else in
Start from one and two
Count from one to five

When you go out
And I'm staying in
Little has changed
But it's just enough"
when you sleep,cake,"When you sleep
Where do your fingers go?
What do your fingers know?
What do your fingers show?
Where do your fingers go?
When you sleep
Do they tremble on the edge of the bed
Or do you fold them neatly by your head
Do they clench like claws against your own skin
When you're living your day all over again
When you sleep (when you sleep)
Where do your fingers go? (when you sleep)
What do your fingers know? (when you sleep)
What do your fingers show? (when you sleep)
Where do your fingers go, yeah? (when you sleep)
Do they play guitar in a Latin bar
Are they strangers or lovers
Do they drive your car
Are they swimming submissively
Sex acts of life
Or just cutting through jello with a very sharp knife
Now Zeus was a womanizer
Always on the make
But Hera usually punished her that Zeus was one to take
When you sleep
Where do your fingers go?
Are they pulling out weeds from the dusty soil
But then never rewarded with the fruits of their toil
Are they scratching their nails on the chalkboards of death
Only seeking attention when everyone in the room has left
(When you sleep) where do your fingers go?
(When you sleep) what do your fingers know?
(When you sleep) what do your fingers show?
(When you sleep) where do your fingers go?

And time after time
You done me wrong

It's just like a train
You let all my friends come over to eat
You were so strange
You didn't even have the decency to change the sheets

(Oh girl)

When you were mine
I used to let you wear all of my clothes
And you were so fine
Maybe that's the reason that it hurt me so

Oh I know that you're going with another guy
I don't care
Because I love you babe and that's no lie

I love you more than i did when you were mine

When you were mine
You were kinda sorta my best friend
So I was blind
I let you fool around
And I never cared
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there
Sleeping in between the two of us

I know that you're going with another guy
I don't care
Because i love you baby and that's no lie

I love you more than I did when you were mine

(When you were mine
You were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Following him whenever he's with you)

I know that you're going with another guy
I don't care
Because I love you babe and that's no lie

where or when,george michael,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when"
where you are,whitney houston,"I saw the news this morning
And saw your face across the screen
And as I poured my coffee
I picked up a magazine
But as I turned the page
And looked inside
There you were again (there you were)
Oh these lonely times
They never seem to end
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are
Today I did some shopping
Just had to clear my mind again
I can't stop thinkin' bout you
I hopped into a taxi
In a moment I was home
Home again

But as I turned the key
And slept inside
My heart could not pretend (could not pretend)
All those feelings
Not those feelings
Not again
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are

Tossing and turning in my sleep
I can't take being without you
I'm gonna catch the next plane out
I got to get to where you are
No matter how near or far
I got to get there where you are
I know

But as I turned the key
And slept inside
My heart could not pretend (could not pretend)
Oh these lonely times
They never seem to end
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are
I wanna be where you are
I need to be where you are
I wanna be I wanna be baby
You know I need to be
I know I should be there where you are"

where'd you go,the mighty mighty bosstones,"Hello?
Checked the clock when I got home
And realized I was alone
Sat for hours by the window
Wonderin' where did you go?
Couldn't eat or sleep at all
Took the pictures off the wall
Paced the place as time moves slow
And I'm wondering where did you go?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
I want to know
Lit a cigarette I couldn't smoke
Wound the clock until it broke
Went to bed then took a shower
Stared at TV for an hour
Did the dishes, made the bed
Read a book I've never read
Any minute you will show
And I'm wondering where did you go?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
I want to know
Where did you go? [Repeat x4]
I opened the fridge, I opened a beer
And played a tape I couldn't hear
Emptiness began to grow
And I'm wondering where did you go?
Watched the sun come up from the back stairs
Thought about the last few years
I lost control, I screamed, I cried
I punched a pole and went inside
Packed my things called a friend
Wished this emptiness would end
Wrote a note then tore it up
Poured the beer into a cup
Sat on the couch, drank it slow
Wondering where did you go?
I realized I couldn't stay
Grabbed my things and I went away
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
I want to know!"
whirlwind,dispatch,"A whirlwind came into my life and he tried to rescue me
Will you come, will you go
Will you tell me seriously

Twisting burning, my thoughts turning, back to you again
Sweet thing, take me to the end
You'd better dig and take a look inside yourself

So the story goes, and so I've heard it said,
That you left your land, to trade for a place, so far away,
So out of date, that only you could understand
And at the ceiling of my feeling, backed up against the wall,
Sweet thing, you know I'd fall in line
You'd better dig and take a look inside yourself

She wants to be free
I want to know
She wants to be free
I want to know
Yeah

A whirlwind came into my life and he tried to rescue me
Will you come, will you go
Will you tell seriously

Twisting burning, my thoughts turning, back to you again
Sweet thing, take me to the end

She wants to be free
I want to know
She wants to be free
I want to know
Yeah (uh huh yeah yeah)"
whispering grass,the ink spots,"Why do you whisper, green grass?
Why tell the tress what ain't so?
Whispering Grass, the trees don't have to know

No, no
Why tell them all your secrets?

Who kissed there long ago
Whispering Grass, the trees don't need to know
Don't you tell it to the trees

She will tell the birds and bees
And everyone will know
Because you told the blabbering trees

Yes, you told them once before
It's no secret anymore
Why tell them all the old things?
They're buried under the snow
Whispering Grass, don't tell the trees
'Cause the trees don't need to know

Now, don't you tell it to the trees, 'cause they'll just run 'n' tell the birds and
Bees. Then everybody'd know 'cause you told them doggone trees! Yes you did, you know
You did, ya told 'em once before. Now look atcha, honey child, it ain't no secret no mo'.
Why tell them all the old things?
They're buried under the snow
Whispering Grass, don't tell the trees

whistling in the dark,they might be giants,"A woman came up to me and said
""I'd like to poison your mind
With wrong ideas that appeal to you
Though I am not unkind""
She looked at me, I looked at something
Written across her scalp
And these are the words that it faintly said
As I tried to call for help
There's only one thing that I know how to do well
And I've often been told that you only can do
What you know how to do well
And that's be you,
Be what you're like,
Be like yourself,
And so I'm having a wonderful time
But I'd rather be whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
There's only one thing that I like
And that is whistling in the dark
A man came up to me and said
""I'd like to change your mind
By hitting it with a rock,"" he said,
""Though I am not unkind.""
We laughed at his little joke
And then I happily walked away
And hit my head on the wall of the jail
Where the two of us live today.
There's only one thing that I know how to do well
And I've often been told that you only can do
What you know how to do well
And that's be you,

white dove,starsailor,"Found us in a small cafe
Happened to be out that day
To watch it go by

It came to pass that we shall be
Early signs of victory
From out of their eyes

If you lay your guns to ground
Feel the weight of coming down
Fall from your mind

Something that I ought to say
To take away the pain of day
I'm leading the blind

Old man drifting
Won't you carry me out of this place?

Found us in a small cafe
Happened to be out that day
To write it all down

As they fell upon the floor
Thought of all that's gone before
They went to the ground

The old man is drifting
Won't you carry me out of this place?

The white dove is rising
To the sound of your God-given grace
To the sound of your God-given grace"
white gold,metric,"Piss-poor, ride in her sun bathing fireside
We're here for the porn and the sirloin
Get your T-bone
Let your backbone slide
Tunnel and sky collide
Lose friends to the air waves and the airlines

Some future in my eyes, bright
Hush don't explain
When you water down my name
I'll be up too late
Call me when you get
Better at your game
You haven't beat me yet

The waitress
The actress
Got the skin and the bones
With a hairbrush and an air brush
She'd be white gold
She asked the piss-poor ""Why you lookin' for that
Party in the sky
It's just a movie bout a movie to old to die""

white horse,taylor swift,"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should've known, I should've known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear-view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late
To catch me now"

And it rests
With your eyes
Please don't fade and please don't cry,
'Cause it's all white lies
Take a chance watch it fall,
Grab too much
And lose it all
Now I've lost my disguise,
It was all white lies

Stay here,
Lie with me here,
Oh lo-fi
Lonely sighs
I will roam
Lost but never alone,
Hide with me
Hide...

Would it help if I tried,
Or has it sailed
And passed me by
First love grows and then it dies,
And it's all white lies

Stay here,
Lie here with me,
Oh lo-fi,
Lonely sighs
I will roam
Lost but never alone,
Hide with me,
Hide with me

Now you move with the tide
And I've heard you've found peace of mind
And now I know that life's design
Moves around white lies
White lies, white lies, white lies"
white magic,mustasch,"I believe that white is clean
It's all there in what you dream
And what we saw ain't magic seeds at all

Truth is bold and good is gold
The only thing that I've been told
And what we hold is closer to the fall

White Magic

Catch the mystery, catch the myth
Try to figure out why we stand tall

What you see is what you need
Is why we bleed there's nothing more at all

White Magic"

As they glow
As they glow
These dreams under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights
These dreams under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights
Of these white nights
Of these white nights
Of these white nights

Something is about to be born
There's a restlessness in me
Keeps me up until the dawn
There is no silence
I will keep following the sirens
There is no silence
I will keep following the sirens

Or a robin, or a wren
Or a fly?

Do you believe in reincarnation?
Were you ever here before?
Have you ever had dreams
That you knew were true?
Some time, before in your life
Have you ever had that experience?
So you must question
All the truths that you know
All the love in the life
That you know and say

Who am I?

Will I ever live again
As a mountain lion
Or a rooster, or a hen
Or a robin, or a wren

And again and again

If it's good enough for me, they're good enough for you too

Who are you? Who are you?

You get so intoxicated that you find it hard to see
And then you tell me stories, are they purely fantasy?

To the glory or the flame
WHo ya gonna praise forever

So I go to where I can get off
On a curve  through the shoulder
There's no parking in that trough
So I drive around all day
Coming atmospheric haze
Till I want to get on again
Then  all I have to say is
All I want to do is to thank you

why?,michael card,"Why did it have to be a friend
Who chose to betray the Lord
Why did he use a kiss to show them
That's not what a kiss is for

Only a friend can betray a friend
A stranger has nothing to gain
And only a friend comes close enough
To ever cause so much pain

And why did there have to be thorny
Crown pressed upon His head
It should have been the royal one
Made of jewels and gold instead

It had to be a crown of thorns
Because in this life that we live
For all who seek to love
A thorn is all the world has to give

And why did it have to be
A heavy cross He was made to bare
And why did they nail His feet and hands
His love would have held Him there

It was a cross for on a cross
A thief was supposed to pay
And Jesus had come into the world
To steal every heart away

Yes, Jesus had come into the world
To steal every heart away"
why,andrew bird,"Why? Why'd you do that?
You shouldn't have done that
If I told you once, I told you three times
That you'll get your punishment when you
Show me your crimes

And it's not a spell or a curse you put on me
Or the way you make me smile so tenderly
How I wish it was your temper you were throwing
Damn you for being so easygoing

I thought that time would tell
My sins would provoke you
To raise, raise some hell, oh

Not a chance
Whatever happened to fiery romance?
How I wish it was your dishes you were throwing
Damn you for being so easygoing

Why? Why'd you do that?
Why'd I do what?
I didn't do anything
Look, I'm just standing here
Well, that's just it, why'd you go ahead and do
Nothing

I thought that time would tell
My sins would provoke you, yeah
To raise, raise some hell, ooh

Don't give me that line
Don't try to tell me that inaction is not a crime
Can't you see what kind of seeds you're sowing?
Damn you for being so easygoing"

Wide open spaces far away

Not feel scared

Riding bareback carefree along the shore

Jumping headfirst
Headlong without a thought
To act and damn the consequence
How I wish it could be that easy
But fear surrounds me like a fence
I wanna break free

We had just pressed the shells into our bones
And we saw the queen in the sky
Gently revealing the treasures of her crowns
Took off all of our Armour
Every last single drop of gold
And we banished the land
Lifted our bodies right up into the cold

Wilderness
In the darkest night
I call out to my brothers
Come join me in flight

And the tears they did roll
From the salty sea, the rainy sky
And the wide eye, the wide eyes
My heart it did swell
As the grandest of stars burst out names in the skies
I can see but a thousand
Of families and friends I have thought but long gone
And the thunder claps hands as I embrace them
And we held on to every single last word

Wilderness
In the darkest night
I call out to my brothers
Come join me in flight"

Can I believe the magic of your sighs?

Yeah

Tonight with words unspoken
And you say that I'm the only one

In the late afternoon, you're hung up on wind chimes

wind up,jethro tull,"When I was young and they packed me off to school
And taught me how not to play the game
I didn't mind if they groomed me for success
Or if they said that I was just a fool.

So I left there in the morning
With their God tucked underneath my arm
Their half-assed smiles and the book of rules

And I asked this God a question
And by way of firm reply
He said, ""I'm not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays""

So to my old headmaster (and to anyone who cares)
Before I'm through I'd like to say my prayers

I don't believe you
You had the whole damn thing all wrong
He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays.
Well, you can excommunicate me on my way to Sunday school
And have all the bishops harmonize these lines

How do you dare tell me that I'm my Father's son?
When that was just an accident of birth
I'd rather look around me, compose a better song
'Cos that's the honest measure of my worth
In your pomp and all your glory you're a poorer man than me
As you lick the boots of death born out of fear

When I was young and they packed me off to school
And taught me how not to play the game
I didn't mind if they groomed me for success
Or if they said that I was just a fool
I left there in the morning
With their God under my arm
Their half-assed smiles and the book of rules

Well, you can excommunicate me on my way to Sunday school

No revelations in the water, no tears into the booze

This days been one long test
Years pass too fast
Have to stop
Like an angel she appears
Created out of air
And all you troubles all your fears
Like blown away

Cause she winks at you
You feel your legs shake
You blow a kiss back
Then time stops until she turns her back

A swarm of heads turn around
And cross the street, oh
Waves of electricity
You feel the heat
You start walking fast
And blindly you're like an ant in a stack
And years pass too fast
Yet in your dreams, you know
Cause she winks at you
You feel your legs shake
You blow a kiss back
Then time stops until she turns her back"
winter kills,alison moyet,"Green in your love on bright days
You grew sun blind, you thought me unkind
To remind you how winter kills

Lost in daydreams you drove too fast and got nowhere
You rode on half fare when you got too scared
How winter kills
Tear at me searching for weaker seams

Pain in your eyes makes me cruel, makes me spiteful
Tears are delightful welcome your nightfall
How winter kills
I'll tear at you searching for weaker seams

Winter kills
Winter kills
Winter kills"
winter lady,leonard cohen,"Trav'ling lady, stay a while
Until the night is over
I'm just a station on your way
I know I'm not your lover
Well I lived with a child of snow
When I was a soldier
And I fought every man for her
Until the nights grew colder
She used to wear her hair like you
Except when she was sleeping
And then she'd weave it on a loom
Of smoke and gold and breathing
And why are you so quiet now
Standing there in the doorway?
You chose your journey long before
You came upon this highway
Traveling lady, stay a while
'Til the night is over
I'm just a station on your way
I know I'm not your lover"

This is my winter song to you
The storm is coming soon
It rolls in from the sea

My voice, a beacon in the night
My words will be your light
To carry you to me

Is love alive?
Is love alive?
Is love-

They say that things just cannot grow
Beneath the winter snow
Or so I have been told

They say we're buried far
Just like a distant star
I simply cannot hold

Is love alive?
Is love alive?
Is love alive?

This is my winter song
December never felt so wrong
'Cause you're not where you belong
Inside my arms

Bum bum bum bum, bum bum bum bum
Bum bum, bum bum bum bum
Bum bum, bum bum bum bum

I still believe in summer days
The seasons always change
And life will find a way

I'll be your harvester of light
And send it out tonight
So we can start again

Is love alive?
Is love alive?
Is love alive?

This is my winter song
December never felt so wrong
'Cause you're not where you belong
Inside my arms

This is my winter song to you
The storm is coming soon
It rolls in from the sea

My love, a beacon in the night
My words will be your light
To carry you to me

Snow is glistening

We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man""
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's Jerry Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man""

There's dry blood, on your wrist
Your dry blood on my fingertip

Looking at you now, you would never know

I feel you just beyond a star
Do you know how much you are all I ever wanted?
Is it too much too soon?
Am I foolishly dreaming?
Just baying at the moon
Playing impossible visions like an elementary tune
How I wish that I could realise my heart
But it's only wishful thinking on my part

without a word,giant sand,"Dragon, they talk like a filibuster
Their words surround me like a gala's cluster
Slagging, spewing is all they're doing
When we do, they manage to muster

Nagging on the wages of sin
I don't know where to begin
It's all working itself on me

And it goes without saying
No one here is paying
Close attention
It goes without saying

Bragging, I like an idiot when
I like we're friends to the end
And this is the end

Your eyes, they talk to me
Your lips, they are something to see
And it goes without saying
No one here is paying
Close attention
It goes without saying

Goes without saying
No one here is paying
Close attention
It goes without saying

They got a squeaky hinge
Way out here on the fringe
From a swinging gate
Just to get the old
From this mortal coil
The damn, it's trying
It's turmoil"
without love,little richard,"I awakened this morning, I was filled with despair
All my dreams turned to ashes and cold, so very cold
As I looked at my life, it was barren and bare
Without love, I've had nothing at all

Without love, I had nothing
Without love, I had nothing at all, yeah
Yes I've conquered, conquered the world
But the world, what do I see?
Without love, I had nothing, nothing at all

Once I had a sweetheart who loved only me
There was nothing, that she would not give to me
I was blind to her goodness and I could not see
That a heart without love cannot live

Without love, I had nothing
Without love, I had nothing at all
Yes I have conquered, conquered the world
But the world, what do I have?
Without love, I had nothing, nothing at all

Without love, I had nothing
Without love, I had nothing
Without love"
with,jason webley,"Six long months at sea,
now a warmer current brings
echoed fragments of a song I think we wrote.
With a worn thin book of maps
and our faith so full of holes
it's a miracle we even stayed afloat.
We could taste the salt through our fingertips
and knew the time had come,
so we said goodbye to the lives we'd lived
and pulled our anchor up.
Now we scrape the barnacles from our hearts
and we row the boat to shore, hallelujah.
You can feel the end even as we start.
We row the boat to shore, hallelujah.
Just on[?] letting go all the things I used to own.
Now I guess the tides are changing once again.
I got so goddamned good at navigating on my own,
but I guess it's time to bring the old boat in.
Well, I've worked so hard to get my sea legs,
and I've earned these calloused hands.
But I drank this ocean down to the dregs;
now I'm thirsty for dry land.
Now I scrape these barnacles from my heart
and I row the boat to shore, hallelujah.
I heard sirens sing themselves apart,
so I row the boat to shore.
I row the boat to shore, hallelujah"

You know it feels unfair

Staring through a window
Standing outside, they're just too happy to care tonight
Wanna be like them

Got kicked outside, everybody saw

From the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

Sometimes I feel so full of love
It just comes spilling out
It's uncomfortable to see
I give it away so easily
But if I had someone I would do anything
I'd never, never, never let you feel alone
I won't, I won't leave you on your own

But who am I to dream?
Dreams are for fools, they let you down

When I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
But I thought that I was doing well
But I just wanna cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world
From the sky down to the sea

I just want to cry now, cry now

The fifty years of sweat and tears
That never left a trace
But when I look at you I see
You feel the same way too
And you will take my hand and be
With me in wonderland

When every head was high
I watched that pride be torn apart
Beneath a darker sky
With innocence within ourselves
We sing the same old song
And you will take my hand
And make believe it's wonderland

I am a working man
I feel the winter too

There's nothing sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She give me toothaches just from kissin' me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

That's when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room, but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much, how long I lived
But I swear I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissing on my baby
And she put her love down soft and sweet
In the low lamp light I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her"
working class hero,john lennon,"As soon as you're born, they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
'Til the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be

They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
'Til you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

There's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me
If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me"

How to behave until the end

In a world where I decide things on my own

And all that I can feel is nothing but sobriety

Not to be wishful not to care
About the plan that's been already
Made for you by other hands

But when you fail there's no one out there
To take your hand, to catch your tears
The whole construction we have built
Leaves no such room for blinding fears

yesterdays,helen merrill,"Yesterdays, yesterdays
Days we knew and happy
Sweet sequester days
Olden days, golden days
Of mad romance and love

Joyous free and flaming life
Then sooth, was mine
Sad am I, glad am I
For today I'm dreaming of yesterdays

yesterday,atmosphere,"I thought I saw you yesterday but I didn't stop
'Cause you was walkin' the opposite way
I guess I coulda shouted out your name
But even if it was you, I don't know what I would say
We could sit and reminisce about the old school
Maybe share a cigarette 'cause we're both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives
Life, love, stress, and setbacks, yes

You could tell me how hard you had it
And you can show me all the scars to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen Sean in all types of light
And I've been meanin' to ask you if I'm doin' alright

Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just goin' crazy 'cause I miss you?

Yesterday was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just goin' crazy 'cause I miss you?

I'm shook, I know, I pushed when I shoulda pulled
Took it all back if I could, I put that on my soul
And I would make a top-notch good listener
And keep the block off a little time to give it here
Since we went our separate paths
I've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past
I can't front, I'm having a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last

Sittin' here, wishin' we could kick it
Givin' me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant, make a visit
I wait up and keep the coffee brewin' in the kitchen
But who am I jokin' with?
There's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it
It doesn't matter, this is more than love
And maybe if I'm lucky, get to see you out the corner of

Or am I just goin' crazy 'cause I miss you?

Yesterday was that you? Looked just like you

Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just goin' crazy 'cause I miss you?

And when you left, I didn't see it coming
I guess I slept, it ain't like you was runnin'
You crept out the front door slow
And I was so self absorbed, I didn't even know
And by the time I looked up, it was booked up
Put it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff
A whole house full of dreams and steps
I think you'd be impressed with the pieces I kept

You disappeared but the history is still here
That's why I try not to cry over spilled beer
I can't even get mad that you gone
Leavin' me was probably the best thing you ever taught me

I'm sorry
It's official
I was a fist-full
I didn't keep it simple
Chip on the shoulder, anger in my veins
Had so much hatred, now it brings me shame
Never thought about the world without you
And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I know it wasn't you 'cause you passed away, Dad

Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just goin' crazy 'cause I miss you?"
yes,coldplay,"(Part I: Yes)

When it started, we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line, my back's on the ropes
When it started, we were alright
But night makes a fool of us in the daylight

There we were dying of frustration
Singing, ""Lord, lead me not into temptation""
But it's not easy when she turns you on

Sin, stay gone

If you'd only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God knows I'm trying my best
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness

So, up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop, then they let go
Dizzily screaming, ""Let the windows down""
As I crawl to the ground

If you'd only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness

You think you running a private, that ain't even the case
And just because you get away, that don't mean its okay
You a dead man walking and I mean it, okay

I'm a real nigga, homie, show six figga's on me
I got a pistol, you don't want it but you know what it is
Aye, I'm way flyer, my pay is way higher
If they ever mention sire, boy, you know what it is

About that drama, you don't want no problems
I love that llama but you know what it is
Aye, I get money, all I count is big money
Because all she get from me, boy, you know what it is

Some of dem boys want to talk what dey have done
They guns sound like popcorn"
you love me,kimya dawson,"I moved around from town to town
Lots of people around, but still so lonely
Friendships would grow, then I'd hit the road
Making up excuses for why I had to leave

Always been too scared and unprepared
To let anybody get too close to me
But when I met you, right away, I knew
You would never ever ever hurt me

And the road's still long but you come along
And you hold my hand and you understand
When I look at you, I can't believe it's true
You're all I ever dreamed of and you love me
And you love me, and you love me"
you make it easy,air,"Never been here, how about you?
You smile at my answer
You've given me the chance
To be held and understood
You leave me laughing without crying
There's no use denying
For many times I've tried
Love has never felt as good
Downtown or way up in the air
When your heart's pounding
You know that I'm aware
You make it easy to watch the world with love
You make it easy to let the past be done
You make it easy
How'd you do it?
How'd you find me?
How did I find you?
How can this be true?
To be held and understood
Keep it coming, no one's running
The lesson I'm learning
Blessings are deserved
By the trust that always could
Downtown or way up in the air
When your heart's pounding
You know that I'm aware
You make it easy to watch the world with love
You make it easy to let the past be done
You make it easy
You make it easy to watch the world with love
You make it easy to let the past be done
You make it easy so watch me fall in love"
you never know,dave matthews band,"Sitting still as stone watching
Watching
People walking by and
wondering why
No one ever stops to talk or thinks about it
they ever did
What if God shuffled by?
One day we might see
Doing not a thing
Breathing just to breathe
We might find some reason
But rushing around seems what's wrong with the world
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They'll only be there til you're dead
Dream
Lying on the roof counting
The suns that fill the sky, I wonder is
Someone in the heavens looking back down on me
I'll never know
So much space to believe
Funny when you're small
The moon follows the car
There's no one but you see
Hey, the moon is chasing me
I worried if I looked away she'd be gone
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They'll only be there til you're dead
Dream
Walking through the wood
No cares in the world
The world she's come to play
She's all mine just for a day
There's not a moment to lose in the game
Don't let the troubles in your head
Steal too much time, you'll soon be dead
So play
All fall down
It won't be so long now
Out of the darkness comes light like a flash
You think you can, you think you can
Sometimes that is the problem
Dream, little darling, dream
Spinning on the wind
The leaf fell from the limb
But everyday should be a good day to die
O,h all fall down
It won't be too long now
Every fire dies
I find it hard to explain how I got here
I think I can, I think I can
Then again I will falter
Dream
Oh, I think I can, I think I can
I think I can, I think I can
Dream, little darling, dream
Spinning on the wind
The leaf fell from the limb"
you only live twice,natacha atlas,"You only live twice, or so it seems
One life for yourself, and one for your dreams
You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is its name
And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger o"
you raise me up,westlife,"When I am down and oh my soul so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
Then I am still and wait here in the silence
Until you come and sit a while with me

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains

You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas

I am strong, when I am on your shoulders

You raise me up, to more than I can be

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders

you suck,consolidated,"Cabal@maple.circa.ufl.edu]

You Suck!
~~~~~~~~~
-Consolidated featuring the Yeastie Girls

I know you're really proud, cause you think you're well-hung,
But I think it's time you learn how to use your tongue.
You say you want things to be even and you want things to be fair,
But you're afraid to get your teeth caught in my pubic hair.
If you're lying there expecting me to suck your dick,
You're going to have to give me more than just a token lick.
Well, you may not like it but you better learn how,
CAUSE IT'S YOUR TURN NOW.

Now, YOU SUCK, suck it hard, go down baby.
YOU SUCK, lick it hard, and move your tongue around.

If you're worried about babies, you can lower your risk-
By giving me that special cunnilingus kiss.
It's on your face that I'm gonna sit.
You can wiggle, you can jiggle your tongue on my clit.
Don't worry about making me have an orgasm.
Just take your time and do it with enthusiasm.
I can tell it's making you scared jut thinking of it,
BUT YOU BETTER LEARN TO LOVE IT.

Now, YOU SUCK, suck it hard, go down baby.
YOU SUCK, lick it hard, and move your tongue around.

When you hear safe sex, you snicker under your breath.
We got to take cover, we're flirting with death.
AIDS is our problem, we've got to talk.
Break out your dental dam and your latex sock.
I'm your latex lover wrapped like a gift,
Got my microwave plastic wrap heating up my clit.
Dinners on, get busy with my booty.
Got a couple of flavors, sweet licorice and fruity.
I know you're sad, luscious pussy with a cover.
I'm aching, too, we can't taste each other.
There's no slacking off with an unprotected stroke.
THIS AINT NO JOKE.

Now, YOU SUCK, suck it hard, go down baby.
YOU SUCK, lick it hard, and move your tongue around.

Sisters... you've got the power. Use it.

W: You brought a condom, right?
M: HUH?
W: I'm unprotected.
M: Aint you on the pill?

W: Oh, that was great and everything, but you know
I think it's your turn to go down on me.
M: I'm tired, I'm tired.
W: What do you mean your tired?
Come on baby, come on.
M: No, no, that's aweful... that taste- terrible.
W: You asshole, you shit.

Well, I know you think it's a real drag,
To suck my cunt when I'm on the rag.
Quit making up stories, yeah give me a break.
Cause I really don't believe that you got a headache.
You tell me it's gross to suck my yeast infection.
How do you think I feel when I GAG on your erection? (uh!)
Your wasting your tongue with lame excuses,
GET YOUR FACE BETWEEN MY THIGHS.

Now, YOU SUCK, suck it hard, go down baby.
YOU SUCK, lick it hard, and move your tongue around"
you take my breath away,eva cassidy,"Sometimes it amazes me
How strong the power of love can be
Sometimes you just take my breath away

You watch my love grow like a child
Sometimes gentle and sometimes wild
Sometimes you just take my breath away

And it's too good to slip by
Too good to lose
Too good to be there just to use
I'm gonna stand up on a mountain top
And tell the news
That you take my breath away

Sometimes it amazes me
How strong the power of love can be
Sometimes you just take my breath away

Your beauty is there in all I see
And when I feel your eyes on me
Oh don't you know you just take my breath away

And it's too good to slip by
Too good to lose
Too good to be there just to use
I'm gonna stand up on a mountain top
And tell the news
That you take my breath away

And it's too good to slip by
Too good to lose
Too good to be there just to use
I'm gonna stand up on a mountain top
And tell the news
That you take my breath away

Oh yes you take my breath away"
you'll never walk alone,johnny cash,"When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet, silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone"
you're beautiful,mojave 3,"Velvet eyes are a part of me
Sunset smiles and secret tears
Time my life to a fallen leaf
Watch the spring in all its plumage
Beautiful like the stars at night
Twist and turn before the dawn
Beautiful like the moon at night
Ducks and dives into the sea
Curtains drawn, you'll miss the light
Your dawning spell will be broken
Vanished days are hard to find
Half-life dreams will not be worth much
But you're beautiful like the stars at night
Twist and turn before the dawn
Beautiful like the moon at night
Ducks and dives into the sea"
you're not alone,home grown,"Just say goodbye.
And close the door.
Turn off the light.
And pick up the pieces if you need them.
This world is cold, but just know you're not alone.
No, you're not alone.
I know what you're thinkin'.
I know how you're feelin'.
Believe me you're not alone.
I know what you're thinkin'.
I know how you're feelin'.
Believe me you're not alone.
I've been here before.
Just where you are and not quite so sure that I did the right thing.
Believe me.
And this world is cold so I'll make sure you're not alone.
No you're not alone.
I know what you're thinkin'.
I know how you're feelin'.
Believe me you're not alone.
I know what you're thinkin'.
I know how you're feelin'.
Believe me you're not alone, no.
Why don't you stay with me tonight.
Because I know everything is not alright,
Why don't you stay with me tonight.
Because I know everything is not alright,
and that's not alright.
I know what you're thinkin'.
I know how you're feelin'.
Believe me you're not alone.
I know what you're thinkin'.
I know how you're feelin'.
Believe me you're not alone. No
No you're not aloneou're not alone."
you're so strange,reigning sound,"When you wake up in the morning
First thing on your mind
Find some kind of connection
Get out of your mind
Out on the street at night
Waking up in your clothes
Don't know why I want you girl
You did it soon
Well but you're so strange
You got me rearranged

Take all my money
Smoke my cigarettes
Lie in my bed crying
Talking 'bout what next you said
I don't wanna hear anymore
Don't wanna hear anymore
I've given you everything
You give nothing back
Well you're so strange
You got me rearranged
You got me rearranged

If you can make it with me
Go back to mama
If you can live with me
Go back to your daddy
'Cause I've got something more
I've got something more
You're so strange
You got me rearranged
You got me rearranged
You got me rearranged"
you're the one,hoobastank,"Tonight I'm letting go
Of all the old excuses
The fears I built so close
'Cause inside I've always known
That no one else could ever do
Or ever feel like home

There's so many things I'll never know
But this I know for sure

You're the one
I need you more than ever
It's taken too long
Taken too long to say

My life began
The night we spent together
Now I cannot live
I'd die any other way

I'm not afraid

You're the one

It hasn't always been
The best of times
But if you'd ask
I'd do it all again

(Are you ready to begin)

I'm ready to begin
A brand new chapter of our lives
Just tell me where and when

(A brand new chapter in our lives)

'Cause there's so many things I'll never know
But this I know for sure

You're the one
I need you more than ever
It's taken too long
Taken too long to say

My life began
The night we spent together
Now I can not live
I'd die any other way
I'm not afraid

You're the one

You're the one
Who understands
Who makes me better than I am
I do it all because of you
When all we had
Had come undone
You stood and fought
And didn't run
You're the one who
Pulled us through

You're the one
I feel it more than ever
It's taken too long
Taken too long to say

Our lives began
The night we spent together
Now I can not live
I'd die any other way

I'm not afraid
You're the one"
you've made me so very happy,alton ellis,"I lost at love before,
Got mad and closed the door.
But you said try just once more.
I chose you for the one,
Now I'm having so much fun.
You treated me so kind,
I'm about to lose my mind.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.
The others were untrue,
But when it came to lovin' you,
I'd spend my whole life with you.
'Cause you came and you took control,
You touched my very soul.
You always showed me that
Loving you was where it's at.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.
I love you so much, it seems
That you're even in my dreams.
I hear you calling me.
I'm so in love with you,
All I ever want to do is
Thank you, baby.

Call, I'm angry
Call, I'm desperate for your voice
Listening to the song we used to sing in the car
Do you remember, Butterfly, Early Summer
It's playing on repeat
Just like when we would meet, like when we would meet
I was born to tell you I love you,
And I am torn to do what I have to,
To make you mine
Stay with me tonight
Stripped and polished, I am new, I am fresh
I am feeling so ambitious, you and me, flesh to flesh
'Cause every breath that you will take
While you are sitting next to me
Will bring life into my deepest hopes
What's your fantasy?
What's your, what's your, what's your, what's your
I was born to tell you I love you,
And I am torn to do what I have to,
To make you mine
Stay with me tonight
And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment
Makes me want to come back home
And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment
Makes me want to come back home
And I'm tired of being all alone,

Makes me want to come back home

As we said our goodbyes
Can't Get Them Out Of My Mind
And I Find I Can't Hide (From)
Your Eyes
The Ones That Took Me By Surprise
The Night You Came Into My Life
Where There's Moonlight
I See Your Eyes

How'd I Let You Slip Away
When I'm Longing So To Hold You
Now I'd Die For One More Day
'Cause There's Something I Should
Have Told You
There's Something I Should Have
Told You

When I Looked Into Your Eyes
Why Does Distance Make Us Wise?
You Were The Song All Along
And Before The Song Dies

I Should Tell You I Should Tell You
I Have Always Loved You
You Can See It In My Eyes

your ghost,greg laswell,"If I walk down this hallway tonight, it's too quiet
So, I pad through the dark and call you on the phone
Push your old numbers and let your house ring
'Til I wake your ghost

Let him walk down your hallway, it's not this quiet
Slide down your receiver, sprint across the wire
Follow my number and slide into my hand

It's the blaze across your nightgown, it's the phone's ring

I think last night, you were driving circles around me
I think last night, you were driving circles around me
I think last night, you were driving circles around me
I think last night, you were driving circles around me
I can't drink this coffee, 'til I put you in my closet
Let him shoot me down and let him call me off
Take it from his whisper, you're not that tough

It's the blaze across your nightgown, it's the phone's ring

I think last night, you were driving circles around me

I think last night, you were driving circles around me
I think last night, you were driving circles around me"
your song,ellie goulding,"It's a little bit funny
This feeling inside
I'm not one of those
Who can easily hide

I don't have much money
But boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where
We both could live

So, excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see I've forgotten if
They're green or they're blue

Anyway the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes
I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple but
Now that it's done

I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world

If I was a sculptor
But then again, no
Or a girl who makes potions in
A travelling show

I know it's not much but
It's the best I can do
My gift is my song and
This one's for you

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind

I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world"
your town,deacon blue,"I wouldn't want to be you
Mostly not even near you
When you're gone they will curse you
And raise the tide against you

I no longer care now
For what you said was fair now
I just don't go there now
I just don't go

Maybe there's a way not to make it hurt
To cover up the words like you covered up the dirt
Ever since you left
It just gets worse
Living out in your town

Now let's say it like it is
I just don't know where to begin
It's a different way of living
It's so strange to what we've been

First we speak for ourselves now
And people know who we are now
And they wake up and they live now
Yes they wake up and they live

Maybe there's a way not to let it hurt
Tell it out in pictures
And songs and words
Do what we should not
To make it worse
Living out in your town

Maybe there's a way not to let it hurt
Tell it out in pictures
And songs and words
Do what we should not
To make it worse
Living out in your town
Living out in your town
Living out in your town
Living out in your town"
your way,paul mccartney,"I like it
Please don't take my heart away
It's happy
Where it is so let it stay
You gave me love
You gave me what I wanted
You gave me love your way

I've seen it
Shining from the furthest stars
Like Venus
Saw it on the way to Mars
You gave me love
You gave me what I wanted
You gave me love your way

Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight

I like it
Please don't take my heart away
It's happy
Where it is so let it stay
You gave me love
You gave me what I wanted
You gave me love your way

Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight

Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight

You gave me love your way"
yours to keep,guided by voices,"To see you sight unseen is worse
Then pick you up because you're first
And go where the whistle blows
And go where the captain knows
Is just a lie

To train the bear to not get up
Slay the beast and win the cup
And stay with the sweet flesh prize
A necklace of 50 eyes
Is yours to keep"
yours,fay wolf,"When I go to sleep and I pray to be in yours
When I talk a bit pillow full o' spit I'm yours
When I cave away it's so I can say I'm yours
Single file is our fav'rite style but still I'm yours
When I make a deal it's so I can steal all yours
When I'm stormin' thru turnin' black to blue I'm yours
When I check you off nearly every box I'm yours
I'm awake to this you turn on and shit I'm yours
I hope
I glow
Why don't you get off and get on your way
Why don't you get off and get on your way
Why don't you get off and get on your way
Or shut me up and stay
Stay
When I go to sleep and I pray to be in yours
When I talk a bit pillow full o' spit I'm yours
When I cave away it's so I can say I'm yours
Single file is our fav'rite style but still I'm yours
Single file is our fav'rite style but still I'm yours
Single file was our fav'rite style but now I'm yours"
you,das pop,"You, you break my heart
You tear me up, in so many parts
One part for you and one for me
That is how it ought to be
You, you know my sins
You know that I will do them again
I do one for you and one for me
That is how it ought to be

You struck me
That is why i'm standin' here
You struck me
You are everything I fear
You struck me
Since you're gone our home has changed
You struck me
I just wanna get out of here

You, you break my heart
You tear me up, in so many parts
One part for you and one for me
That is how it ought to be

You struck me
You struck me
You struck me
You struck me
You, you break my heart
Oh you oh you
Yeah you
You break my heart
Oh you oh you
You break my heart
You tear me up in so many parts
One part for you and one for me
And that is how it ought to be"
zebra,man man,"They said i'm worn thin from wasting to much time
On your sidelines waving a sign that says i will work
For you but they don't know your kiss to me is a hatchet through my chest
That sends me down a flight of stairs hitting every step

And i swear to god
It's not my fault this mask i wear
It's not my fault this gloom i bare
It's not my fault this mask i wear
It's not my fault this gloom i bare
It's not my fault this mask i wear
It's not my fault this gloom i bare

And they said i'm tired from waiting around for you
The reasons i start fires is that's what lost men do
Split dogs and hoof in mouth you are broken glass
Don't care if i cut myself i'll crash into the crash

You stung me bad, what can i do?
But leave the stinger in so i won't forget you
You stung me bad, what can i do?
But leave the stinger in so i won't forget you

Ahhhhh they said i'm wrong
Ahhhhh i know i'm wrong
Ahhhhh they said i'm wrong
Ahhhhh i was born wrong"
zero gravity,mnemic,"Light I can See, turn it out in me
Wasted time to be, what you wanted from me"
zombie dance,the cramps,"At the Zombie Dance
Here's Ben and Betty
They tap their toes
But they don't get sweaty
They don't give a damn
They're done dead already

At the Zombie Dance
Nobody moves
They tap their toes
Yeah, wiggle their ears to get in the groove
Yeah

They do 'The Boogaloo'
At the Zombie Hall
They write ""BORN TO LOSE""
On Zombie restroom wall
The kinda life they choose
Ain't life at all

At the Zombie Dance
Nobody moves
They tap their toes
Yeah, wiggle their ears to get in the groove
Yeah (move!)

Everybody calm down
Nobody blow their cool
Nobody hang around
Zombie dancing school
They do the swim face-down
In the Zombie pool

At the Zombie Dance
Nobody moves
They tap their toes
Yeah, wiggle their ears to get in the groove
Yeah

At the Zombie Dance
Nobody moves
Yeah"
далеко,мельница,"Обернули жемчужины шею
В три ряда, в три ряда
Говорил, ты будешь моей иль ничьею
Никогда, никогда

Ты был львом и оленем
Ты из гордого племени
Живущего там у небесной черты
Где ночи крылаты, а ветры косматы
И из мужчин всех доблестней ты

Из ладони просыпались пылью
Потерялись в камнях
Все слова, что тебе говорили
Про меня, про меня...

Что у меня теплые плечи и гордые речи
И колючие свечи в темноте высоко
Моя верность хранится
Там где пляшут зарницы
Как бы ты не стремился
Не достанешь рукой, ой!...

Я спущу на воду венок со свечою
Так легко, так легко
Чтобы плыл по ручьям, полыньям за тобою
Далеко, далеко

В полыньях среди туч чтоб светил он
Высоко, высоко
В том краю, куда я тебя отпустила
Далеко, далеко!

Где ночи крылаты, где кони косматы
Где щиты, мечи и латы
Словно песни звенят
Корабли под парусами
Под павлиньими хвостами
И ведьмы нежнее и краше меня

У них теплые плечи и дерзкие речи
Посмотри, как тают свечи в темноте высоко
Где кони крылаты, а ветры косматы
И это все далеко, далеко, далеко!"
кокон,flёur,"Моя комната - душный, замкнутый плен
Но я пытаюсь прорвать полиэтилен
Я это делаю снова и снова
Мне осталось всего два слова

Что можно построить такими руками?
Но я делала всё, что могла
Высекала узоры на камне
И плавила из стекла

В этот кокон из стёкол и рам
Не проходит тьма или свет
Может, будет бабочка там
Может быть, может нет

Может, вырастут новые крылья
Красота, доброта
И расправить их будут силы
Может, нет, может, да

Моя комната крепче, чем то, что в ней есть
Но я пытаюсь пробить прочную жесть
Я это делаю снова и снова
Но не могу пролезть

Что можно придумать
Больной головой моей
Но я сделала всё, что могла
Построила мир без начальств и властей
Уничтожила все зеркала

В этот кокон из стёкол и рам
Не проходит тьма или свет
Может, будет бабочка там
Может быть, может нет

Может вырастут новые крылья
Красота, доброта
И расправить их будут силы
Может, нет, может, да

Но если вдруг куколка будет пустой?
Что, если снова куколка будет пустой?
Если куколка будет пустой
Не удивлюсь, я видела много пустого
Буду двигаться дальше по схеме простой
Начиная снова и снова

В этот кокон из стёкол и рам
Не проходит тьма или свет
Может, будет бабочка там
Может быть, может нет

Может, вырастут новые крылья
Красота, доброта
И расправить их будут силы
Может, нет, может, да

В этот кокон из стёкол и рам
Не проходит тьма или свет
Может, будет бабочка там
Может быть, может нет

Может, вырастут новые крылья
Красота, доброта
И расправить их будут силы
Может, нет, может, да"
русский рок,ддт,"Хоронили русский рок, хоронили
Тучи пепла, толпы гари и пыли
А он лежал в гробу хороший, пригожий
Совершенно на труп не похожий

Хоронили русский рок, хоронили
Зубы ныли от холодного ветра
Он трепал лохмотья черного спектра
И газетки с приговорами гнили

Хоронили русский рок, хоронили
Забросали говном да распяли
Затоптали, развели, разодрали
Надругаясь, матерились и выли

Хоронили мастера сексатаки
Полуграмотные поп-менестрели
Все мохаммеды али после драки
Фонограммные болванки и щели

Шоу-бизнес оплатил все расходы
Профессиональные ломы да лопаты
Чтобы глупость не вышла из моды
Чтоб мозги цвели из тряпок и ваты

Вдохновляясь, несли гроб, пятясь раком
На поминках сладко пили и ели
Совокуплялись, жрали булки со смаком
Доползли, им казалось, до шеи

Хоронили революцию слуха
Отражения света и воли
Кто еще не пнул упавшему в ухо
Садомазо, не сосавшие боли

Из желающих очередь вышла
На Руси всегда хоронят исправно
В смерти больше у нас видят смысла
Чтобы жизнь-кровища вытекла славно

Грызите, черти, разноцветные банки
Лижите череп оптимизма большого
Молитесь дыркам, фарисеи-поганки
Укротители глобального шоу

А мне не важно, какой стиль, когда слякоть
Хардкор, рэп или что-то похоже
Важно петь, как дышать, а не вякать
Чтобы русский мороз шел по коже

А на утро пришли насладиться
Эксгумировать хлоркой и дустом
Вскрыли гроб, а там, внутри, пусто
И никого - ни червя, ни артиста

Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света
Привет с того света"
старый отель,жанна агузарова,"Полу пустой вагон метро длинный тоннель.
Меня везёт ночной экспресс в старый отель.
И пусть меня, ни кто не ждёт у дверей, вези меня ночной экспресс в
ези меня скорей.
Город прлывет. В море цвет
ных огней город живёт. Счастьем своих людей, старый отель. Дв
ери свои открой старый отель, в полночь меня укрой.
Но тёплый дождь не бьёт в стекло. Мокрых каретки. И электро
нное табло смотрит мне в след
. Домов кварталы спят давно видят сны. И смотрит вновь в моё окно те
нь слепой луны.
Припев."
февраль,alai oli,"Ночью мне снились пальмы и берега Испании
Я проснулась и вышла на улицу
В любимых кедах Fallen
Хотя, конечно, стоило одеть валенки
А я совсем забыла
Скажите, неужели это правда Россия?
И что солнце остыло?

А февраль это месяц надежды
Что скоро мы скинем одежды
Что следущим летом будет лучше, чем прежним
И даже теплее, чем прежним
Душа почему-то улетает на юг
Там, где солёный ветер
А-я-я-я-яй
Надежда мой друг
Если кто не заметил
А надежда мой друг

В сероватой дымке закат над Парижем
А я сижу на крыше
Закрываю глаза и вижу
Ромашки в траве
Там ниже-ниже-ниже
И этот район моей мечты
Утопает в зелени летом, скажи
Неужели, ты всё ещё ждёшь ответа
Ведь песня ещё не допета

А февраль это месяц надежды
Что скоро мы скинем одежды
Что следущим летом будет лучше, чем прежним
И даже теплее, чем прежним
Душа почему-то улетает на юг
Там, где солёный ветер
А-я-я-я-яй
Надежда мой друг
Если кто не заметил
А надежда мой друг

Со своей горы он смотрел на запад
А я снег отряхнула с дред
Ведь эта печать – наш с тобой завет
Отец, помоги найти силы
Пока твой взгляд не согреет Россию
Не согреет сердца, которые остыли
И солнце, которое остыло

А февраль это месяц надежды
Что скоро мы скинем одежды
Что следущим летом будет лучше, чем прежним
И даже теплее, чем прежним
А я улетаю на юг
Там, где солёный ветер
А-я-я-я-яй
Надежда мой друг
Если ты не заметил
А надежда мой друг"
空,倖田來未,"広がるよ ほらみて
君の笑顔の奥の悲しみ
なくす勇気 君の胸の中にあるから

空よ教えて 自分ができることには
限界があるのかと考えて見上げる
「空には青い世界があるけど 僕には何があるのかな...」
卑屈になってしまう

人の幸せは どこまでも広がる
遂げられなかった想い 届けようと誓う

※広がるよ ほらみて
君の笑顔の奥の悲しみ
なくす勇気 君の胸の中にあるから
強くなること 意識せず
素直に笑えばいいさ
自然に歩いてこう 誰も笑いはしない※

少しだけ自分の道 見えてきた気がする
どんなところかは 僕はまだわからない

夢と希望を鞄 詰め込んで
君との出会いを 待っている人がいるから

夏の風 教えてくれる
新しいことを告げに
未来広がるから 君の声を聞かせてよ
この歌が このメロディーが
流れ始めた 今ほら
準備は出来てる 君なら出来るよ きっと

(※くり返し)"
