'Till I Collapse,Eminem,anger,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you, try to find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough

The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?
For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in

It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk 'round like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse

My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one could beat me"

Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks
Big Macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules
Presidential scandals, everybody move
Two words, Mos Def, K. West, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game 'pon lock shit, gun 'pon cock shit
We won't stop shit, everybody move

Two words, BK, NY, Bed Stuy
Too harsh, too hungry, too many, that's why
These streets know game, can't ball, don't play
Heavy traffic, one lane, everybody move
Two words, Mos Def, Black Jack, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game 'pon lock, gun 'pon cock

Two words, Chi-town, South Side, worldwide
'Cause I rep that 'til I fuckin' die
One neck two chains, one waist two gats
One wall, 20 plaques, dues paid, gimme that
I am limelight, Blueprint, five mics
Go-Getters rhyme like should've been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated

Barbershop player-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in
Two words, Chi-town raised me crazy
So I live by two words, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Screamin', ""Jesus save me""
You know how the game be, I can't let 'em change me
'Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
Look, God, it's the same me

And I basically know now, we get racially profiled
Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
Plus I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom, so the top's the only place to go now

Now throw ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go

Two words, freeway, two letters, A-R
Turn y'all rap niggas to two words, fast runners
Like Jackie Joyner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through your car, my God
Two words, no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal
Free, young boss, freshman of the Roc
With the beef in the pot, Jay sent for his dogs to brawl

Forget your squad, better fend for yourself
Have you screamin' out four words, ""Send for the law"", uh
Two words, Freeway, slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in your artist, leave with his broad

Red, white, blue, black (throw your hands up)
Calm down, move back
Motherfuckers askin', ""Who is that?""
You know it's the almighty Black Jack
Mos Def, K. West
Ghetto people, get this shit off your chest
North to the south, to the east, to the west
Black Jack Johnson, it's no contest

What I See,Black Flag,anger,"This feeling haunts me
Behind these eyes, the shell seems so empty
Though I wonder if anything lives inside?

I wanna live
I wish I was dead

My heart aches to bleed
I'm cheated from what I see
Freedom holds a double-edge for me
I look in your eyes and see

I wanna live
I wish I was dead

I don't wanna think
I'm stuck here and I know it
I don't wanna see
Make me close my eyes

I wanna live
I wish I was dead

Life's cold and it reaches inside
I need to feel but turn my mind off
The desperation begins
From the start, I see the end
Not right, I'm not right, you're not right
I've gotta close my eyes

I look in your eyes
And I see it's always this way
Live the lie, take a dive
Just to make it die

I wanna live
I wish I was dead

I've just got to close my eyes
I've got to close my eyes
I've got to close my eyes"
Requiem,Lamb of God,anger,"Down, chemical sacrament
Blasphemous prayer
Deliver me from this
So serene apocalypse

Just make me fucking numb
Deaf, blind and fucking dumb
Return to sacred sleep

This could be my requiem
And I'll feel no pain
This could be my requiem
But don't bury me too deep

Drain infected brine
Sickened cesspool shell of mine
Strap up the hands of time
And push the soul into the vein

Just make me fucking numb
Deaf, blind and fucking dumb
Return to sacred sleep

This could be my requiem
And I'll feel no pain
This could be my requiem
But don't bury me too deep

Rise, stronger, reconstruct

Dispose
Discard
Deny

Glue Man,Fugazi,anger,"I spent it all on the bag

Anything to make them feel less alone

His mind is his own town
Where all his thoughts run aground
They fall all over and down
I spent it all on the bag
On the drag
The sun comes down, the tide rolls back
We crawl our way back to the house
We call home
He holds his home in the palm of his hand
And he says, and he says

You are my anytime, you are my every time
You are my everywhere, anywhere..."""

God really exists I tell you like this it reside inside

Rearing its ugly head
Venom dripping from its grin
As it tosses yet another obstacle in our way
If given a thousand years to collect,
To process, to portray
We could never encompass the voracity
Of one single day
Trapping us in its winding
It's closing malignant cycles
A tightening coil to bind us,
Hold us tight in unforgiving embrace
Its all-engulfing jaws, infinite, boundless
Biting down on the dying flesh of hope
Its fiery breath leveling, dismantling
Flattening, tearing down the structure of our dreams
Overcome, defeated
Terrified, shivering, mute
Reality is terror, this truth is absolute
Reality, this spiteful snake
Shedding its smothering veil
A shroud to asphyxiate,
Exterminate, eradicate"

White blooms to white and
Freezes white again
Close it before something crawls in
Commit it, leave it, get away...
We always
Drop our good side

Being good gets you stuff
Being stuff gets you good
Good stuff gets you being
And wheelin' and dealin' and squelin'
Shit lives forever

They have no legs, but chase us anyway
Wipe the shadow of your best friend
Gave birth to something we don't want to be
We drop our good side

Eat is just as deep as you can fuck it
So cough it up or go down
And there's only one thing that separates
A man...

Shit lives forever

We'll retire with the turd on our lips Under a pair of knowing eyes
I'm gonna take a few down with me
And drop my good side

You can't kill it

Take if from out drummer, ""Pufff""
Being good it gets you stuff"

Somewhere on a toilet wall, I read the words
""You form a line to formalize the former lies,"" and I finally saw the truth
Something so profound, and it was sitting there surrounded by
The garbage and the stains, another victim of the refuse

Now I've been saying this for years, but you don't comprehend it
I fight hell and I fight fear because I understand it
Androgyny and insults, you try so hard to be difficult
You wanna win the war? Know what you're fighting for

Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up

Feather in a Baseball Cap,Architecture in Helsinki,anger,"I've never seen you frown this much

Left this haunted town
The spookiness of night surrounds us in trees
Us on bikes on fountains
Never been alone as such
Your foots on the clutch
Your hand's on my crutch
Slow down
And run in little circles til circles are
Black and on the ground.
And clever isn't where it's at
Cos dumb is back
Heads are holes and clouds

And I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we got this flaunting down
A feather in a baseball cap
You dance all wack
Weakened knees call

And I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we rocked three daunting nouns
It's better not to holla back
Cos life long cracks

And so quick to raise your voice, like
""If I can't find a mistake to blame
We didn't have a choice""
Oh, but you had an option
I was your chance to feel complete
But when I leaned in close to you
You kissed your fear instead of me

You had my hand in your hand
You had my lip in your teeth
You had my heart on your sleeve
You had a chance to breathe
But boy, you wouldn't let your fear recede
So I moved on
Oh, and it's too late to change your mind
Now you got scared, boy, and I got gone
Now you failed and there's no way to turn back time
You had your chance
Boy, I tried

You tried?
I looked her in the eye and smiled
My girl, you must understand that fear is not some product that I made
It crept unwelcome in my head
The day they had her torn away
It changed me

Now at the end of every day
￼I lie awake at night and wait
To feel the wires of my brain
Get cut and quietly rearranged
And hear my beaten heart exclaim
""Still, I refuse to let her go""
So we escape to our mistakes
For they wait patiently for us
Oh, how they always wait for me
If my fear has kept me here
Only my fear can set me free
And I'm sorry dear
But don't you dare speak another word
How could I risk holding your heart in me
While still in love with her?

Your pussy ain't shit 'til you had some Danny in it
I'm gone off a Xanny nodding off watching menace
Rolling off some purple that my nigga call Grimmace

Bitch I ain't finish
These bars was test tubed in the lab with foreign chemist
Rolling testers on it but statistics got slumped
I'm smoking blunt after blunt

And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt

And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt

And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt

And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt

Stop
'Til my brain feels ten pounds heavier
You fell off like Tom Selleck in a Celica
Bitch give me brain for the hell of it
But to her it's heaven if she even gets a smell of it
That's why these bitches fuck with me
'Cause I eat that pussy like a female MC
You get it? How about me and your girlfriend, you with it?
Money over everything the only thing that matter
And since I been getting it my blunts been getting fatter
Take a couple puffs off it now a nigga woozy
The white hoes I fuck with consider them whooties
We 'bout to make a movie, starring me and a cast full of groupies
And I do my own stunts, I'm smoking blunt after blunt

And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt

And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt

And I smoke

(If you're delusional your call
Will be transferred to the mother ship)
Ugh! (Yes I like the drug)

I'm coming through, thought you knew, fuck if you didn't, fuck you
Plutonium lore
What this is, what this for
Feel my fists push black holes
Through your bitch ass decor
Split it back like a whore
And make you shit your fucking drawers

Scared to ride, cowards fall
Before my eyes, sound of my balls
Dragging like cannon loaded wagons
Drug by demons down your halls

Can't imagine whats fit to happen
When I get to flashing, see the small
Shrink to a fraction of what their lacking
And less than that in no time at all.
Can't believe they have the gaul
To try and act like they're not trapped
Between these walls ...

Bring it, bring it, bring it, kill it

Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it (kill it)
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it (kill it, kill it, kill it)

NEVER GET THERE
Does it mean I'm a ghost if I'm still here?
WANNA LEAVE HERE
And if I am why can't I just float through the walls?
THROUGH THE WALLS
And if I can, were they even ever there at all?
NOT AT ALL

Too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, I feel so bad
Been there so long I can't remember who I am, or where I stand
But in the end I guess I just don't give a damn
Twist a gram and keep on sticking with the original plan
Fuck it man
Judge you no more than I wish to be judged
Even on the low
But I do know what you do not speak of
Don't know but it shows
Try to hide but I see who you are because
I just know
Keep talking but you already said too much
There you go

How it is now's how it it always was
That's on my blood
How it is now's how it it always was
That's on my blood

Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it (kill it)
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it (kill it, kill it, kill it)

See my blood spill drip, by chances
Try to chill, quit, cuz I can't just slip into a zagthoth trance
Tongue hissing, serpent chants
Come again work it in, yeah just like that

We paint our insides black
As the shadows 'hind our flesh
And make all that we lack
The part of life that we forget
All praise due to the fact
That we've forgotten how to sweat it
Check it
Bring it
KILL IT

On everything I own
Swear would rather slit my throat and die on the run
Than be the one who ends up hangin from that rope
Tied to the thumb of the man who
Comes to empty your pockets when you choke
Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game
Before I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame
All the way insane
Staring at the ceiling
In the dark
Trying not to let the feeling
Tear you apart
But the silence is buzzing
And it won't stop
Tell yourself its almost over
But its not"

With nothing in the middle

And we're bogged down in a delta of glee

We got tickets they were free

And can you keep sleeping metaphysical girl?
Since the stars predicted something new
Would reconnect our worlds

Skip and chase and say
Forget about tomorrow
Until I realize
This valid and logic motion
Is what keeps me from moving
I don't understand
Running running on tracks
With feet on the ground
It will only slow me down
And which way the wind blows
I run like a man ready to go anywhere

Furor Divinus,Behemoth,anger,"Veto! I vomited forth
From a throat choked by rope
As lunatic mob shackled maimed feet
Tore asunder both wings

Pluck my eyes out, rip my tongue
Make me slave to gravity
Bleed dry ov tears, weep with blood
Leave to atrophy

I sought reprisal high and low
I spew forth plagues to taint their soil
I crept under the shadow ov purity
In my hour ov pious wane
I turned to boundless catechism
Behold the anathema ov benediction
Sacrilege in Gethsemane manifest
Furor Divinus
Anointed sin became flesh

Emerge, the accuser ov all
Hark the universe, cries forlorn
Bleeds from black lungs ov hell
Deflowered by the horns

And so I reversed the wheel ov my fortune
Strike blind the eye ov the lion
With every breath stolen from their lips
I raped and raped and raped the daughters ov Zion
Raise the dagger Abraham
Slit the throat ov thy only son
Reverse the history ov man
Fuck and reset the world

Pluck my eyes out, rip my tongue
Make me slave to gravity
Bleed dry ov tears, weep with blood
Leave my cross to atrophy"

Because I'm more than just a human, I'm a gift to all of you
And I'm here to make sure that my message gets through
I wonder if you're really all as dumb as you look
Or are you smart enough to learn the rules in my book
I hope you understand that the knowledge I bring
Puts me in the position of a God or a king
'Cause I'm blessed with the gift of the magic touch
And I wouldn't say that I'm asking for too much
All you have to do is get down on your knees and pray
And I promise you the remedy is on its way
But you can never be like me so don't waste your time
Because I reign supreme and my position is divine
What's wrong with being self-possessed?
Nobody's satisfied with being second best
I've got the gift and I know that I'm blessed
And I gotta get it off my chest
I'm the biggest, the best, better than the rest
Better than the rest

And you haven't got a chance to even pass my little test
Even if you wanted to you couldn't pay the price
There ain't no room for losers in my perfect paradise
'Cause life is always based upon the weight of your success
So I'll make sure that I get the most and nothing less
If I love myself then everyone will love me too
And there's nothing you can do for me that I can't do
What's wrong with being self-possessed?

Even if you can't afford it, I'll still make you pay
So you better come and get it and enjoy it while you can
Don't tell me that you're dumb enough to think I give a damn
I couldn't care less about what you achieve
And there's only one thing that you have to believe
The only thing important that you have to understand
Is that no matter what you say I'm still a God, I really am
I'm the biggest, the best, better than the rest

To catch the breath
It turns it all around

Single path that I can see
Emptiness devours me

Enlightened by the cold
It overcomes the torment
(What if I could bring you back?)
Enlightened by the cold

Enough to burn through walls
Built on anguish
Can I be revived?

Let it hit with force
Strong enough to blind
The numbness heals

Single path that I can see
Emptiness devours me

Enlightened by the cold
It overcomes the torment
(What if I could bring you back?)
Enlightened by the cold

My worth is only defined
By the nest disaster

When you never know
Is when it's always there
It seemed so clear

The slightest touch
To catch the breath
It turns it all around

Single path that I can see
Emptiness devours me

Enlightened by the cold
It overcomes the torment
(What if I could bring you back?)
Enlightened by the cold

My worth is only defined
By the nest disaster
By the nest disaster"

The Subtle Arts of Murder and Persuasion,Lamb of God,anger,"The dark crow man sits and stares into the oblivion
Into cold into nothingness, it's snowing in his mind.
He's created himself in his own image.
Lust held for him means naught, a knock on the door
Brings no smile to his cruel lips,
The welcome in a woman's eyes holds nothing for him.
Alone on his haunches the hair raises on the back of his neck.
His dead eyes pierce the night.
As his gaze falls down on the city it fills him the method ascertained, conviction.
He knows what to do and moves to commit the deed"

The dirty nails

Shit From an Old Notebook,Minutemen,anger,"Let the products sell themselves

Skinny Little Bitch,Hole,anger,"Skinny little bitch
Starin' at the mirror
In your desperation to disappear

And you would be oh so dumb to fuck with me
'Cause baby you're much too young to end up with me

Your bedroom walls are fallin' down
And everyone can see you now
Your bedroom walls they sell for cheap
You lie, you lie alone
You lie alone, you never sleep
How you never sleep

Ow!

Skinny little bitch
Prayin' to the lord
Praying for some salvation
'Cause she's just so bored

In my vile sex horror, my cheap drugs hell
And all the things you'll never live to tell

And you will never see the light
I'll just obscure it out of spite
You're just a nasty piece of work
Come, come on baby, come on baby let it burn
Oh baby, does it hurt?

Born of foul creation
Born of sour milk
Cocaine filth

You staggered here on broken glass
So I could kick your scrawny ass
And all the drugs and all the burns
What a nasty
What a nasty
Nasty piece of work
Oh baby, does it hurt?
Oh baby just go slower
Oh baby just go lower

Outsider Intro,DJ Shadow,anger,"In the twilight of a time
There emerges a need for man to comprehend his own bitter fate
Finally resigned to the inevitable beyond, he searches the ages
Desperate for stories of assurance, redemption and hope

Such tales fill page upon page with enough ink
To flood a thousand valleys, and drown the tallest tree
But there is one tale that as yet been told
The story of... The Outsider

Desolate and barren, humanities at a crossroads
The people have retreated shuttering their once carefree lives
From unseen enemies which seem to plague not only the physical form
But the innermost thought

Driven by panic, compelled by dread
The masses begin to devolve
Once dear neighbours turn wary foes
Brother against brother, sister against sister

Achievement and ambition are dismissed
As heretical, or worse, treasonous
Even nature itself is scorned
Choked with suspicion and fear
Voices do not dare to sing
Nor fingers to play
Imminent defeat is all but assured

But in the darkest hour
Whispers begin to tell of a figure emerging from the darkness
A being without a name, faceless and obscure
Part presence, part idea they say
As if the very force they describe has existed for eons
A dormant seed awaiting nourishment
Word of radical acts...
Disobedience, non-compliance spread among the people
At first fearful, then defiant, as the legend grows
Whispers turned to cries and the cries into screams
And tend to cower no more the fury of the people
Whose talent behold as they exact revenge on their captors
Spare neither the repentant nor the bold

Now the fire is lit, smouldering in the belly of humanity
It cannot be extinguished, for the stories The Outsider endure
Even as evidence of its presence is debated with the passing years

Messages, dictations, warnings
Stories, such as these..."
Self vs Self,Pendulum,anger,"If I struggle a lifetime
What would my body be?
An empty shell
On what a demon fed

Could be a heavy burden
To stay true to your words
Speak up!
I wanna silence everything

If I got no plan
Doesn't mean that I get what I want for free
If I got no meaning
Would you force me to a place where I make sense
'Cause nothing lasts forever

How do I get home?
Everything revolves around me
If I can't find myself?
It's so completely fake

How do I get home?
Everything revolves around me
If even you can't help?
Dark nights on my soul

I deny failure
I ignite
Woe is on my misery
She wins all their eyes

Realize what defies our fate
This is not me, this is me
So if I struggle a lifetime
What good would that do?

If I got a plan
Doesn't have to stop the feeling inside
If I do make sense
Would you drag me down
'Cause nothing lasts forever

How do I get home?
Everything revolves around me
If I can't find myself?
It's so completely fake

How do I get home?
Everything revolves around me
If even you can't help?
Dark nights on my soul"
Tired Of Being Alive,Danzig,anger,"Don't care
If 'n' you die
Ain't got no reason to cry
Don't feel
Don't need to
Your world ain't nothing to me

I'm fear
I'm your heretic
I'm doom waiting for the number
7 up 7
To the 6 on 6
Bring it on to me

And I'm tired of being alive
Spite of the bleeding
Bleeding light
And I'm tired of their bleeding light
Don't try to feed me
Full of your lies

No regrets
To bring me no tears
Never scared of things men fear
Never easy
Never clean
To be a beast among human sheep

I am fear
I am your heretic
I am your doom
Waiting for the number
7 on 7
To the 6 on 6
Bring it on to me

And I'm tired of being alive
Spite of the bleeding
Bleeding light
And I'm tired of their bleeding light
Don't try to feed me
Full of your lies

And I'm tired of being alive
Spite of the bleeding
Bleeding light
And I'm tired of their bleeding light
Don't try to feed me
Full of your lies"

Shameful Metaphors,Chevelle,anger,"Fear
It's all the same
Should I evolve
To tend to these sights
Said out loud then said again
If fate's so wrong
You'll start to feel lightheaded
By my admission, nothing grows
Just a longer list of unsorted laws
So why then
Has all my life made no sound
And are your eyes
Closing even now
My life made no sound
I fear your eyes closing
Revolting man
This sacred chain
Brought down to trial
No better man could fail the way
You needed all
Keep close the vein of empty
Thoughts
The finest river,
The ravens tend
All along insisting
We're worlds away
Behold the lost
Behold a Band-Aid
These shameful metaphors
Fought it through the teeth
Biting at your heels
Fought it cheek to cheek"
Suffer in Truth,Meshuggah,anger,"Tortured soul ripping skin into ashes
Blind by pain deaf by lies
Smell of freedom violently cuts
Forgiveness
Power to a being never dies
Suffer in truth's narrow passage saw
Weak solutions stabbed to now know
The smile of obliterations face

Penetrating through the void of life
A dance with the dead
Buried in oblivion stolen from the mind
Constant starving never fed

Contaminated life is fading
Laughing in my face
Suffer in deception
Manipulated not to feel
Slain beliefs abandoned dreams
A life of misery

Suffer in truth

The wounds of a soul in pain
A mirror of life
Dreams all in vain
Life will always be sealed

I see... unseen
I feel... unseen

Suffer in truth"
Wasted Life,Stiff Little Fingers,anger,"I could be a soldier
Go out there and fight to save this land
Be a people's soldier
Paramilitary gun in hand
I won't be no soldier
I won't take no orders from no-one
Stuff their fucking armies
Killing isn't my idea of fun

They wanna waste my life
They wanna waste my time
They wanna waste my life
And they've stolen it away

I could be a hero
Live and die for their 'important' cause
A united nation
Or an independent state with laws
And rules and regulations
That merely cause disturbances and wars
That is what I've got now
All thanks to the freedom-seeking hordes

They wanna waste my life
They wanna waste my time
They wanna waste my life
And they've stolen it away

I'm not gonna be taken in
They said if I don't join I just can't win
I've heard that story many times before
And every time I threw it out the door

Still they come up to me
With a different name but the same old face
I can see the connection
With another time and a different place
They ain't blonde-haired or blue-eyed
But they think that they're the master race
They're nothing but blind fascists
Brought up to hate and given lives to waste

They wanna waste my life
They wanna waste my time
They wanna waste my life
And they've stolen it away"
The Beltsville Crucible,Thrice,anger,"True friends stab you in the front
Keep you from getting what you want
When one more fix could kill you
They help you realize that

You're more and
Less than you first had believed
You've so much to give and there's so much you need
Shortcuts through graveyards and a brand new way to breathe
Three thousand miles just to learn,
All that's gold does not all shine...
And helping words aren't always kind,
When one more kiss could kill you,
They help you realize that

You're more and less than you first had believed
You've so much to give and there's so much you need
Shortcuts through graveyards and a brand new way to breathe
Three thousand miles just to learn

(Bridge)

How to let my guard down
Accept the fire that has spread among us.
And if you're feeling all right,
You've got to play it again,
You've got to play it again."
Archives Of Pain,Manic Street Preachers,anger,"If hospitals cure
Then prisons must bring their pain
Do not be ashamed to slaughter
The centre of humanity is cruelty
There is never redemption
Any fool can regret yesterday
Nail it to the House of Lords
You will be buried in the same box as a killer, as a killer, as a killer

A drained white body hanging from the gallows
Is more righteous that Hindley's crotchet lectures
Pain not penance, forget martyrs, remember victims
The weak die young and right now we crouch to make them strong

Kill Yeltsin, who's saying? Zhirinovsky, Le Pen, Hindley and
Brady, Ireland, Allit, Sutcliffe, Dahmer, Nielson, Yoshinori
Ueda, Blanche and Pickles, Amin, Milosovic

Give them respect they deserve
Give them the respect they deserve

Execution needed
A bloody vessel for your peace
If man makes death then death makes man
Tear the torso with horses and chains
Killers view themselves like they view the world, they pick at the holes
Not punish less, rise the pain
Sterilise rapists, all I preach is extinction

Kill Yeltsin, who's saying? Zhirinovsky, Le Pen, Hindley and

Fields of Desolation,Arch Enemy,anger,"On the fields of desolation
We are all alone
Crying in each other's arms
In fear of the unknown
Feelings of uncertainty
We are all doomed
To live in solitude
And never ending gloom

On the fields of desolation
Eternal life or termination

Why won't you cover me?
I need your sanctuary
This sea I'm drowning in
Might be where end begins

In times of grief and sadness
We're searching for the light
Seek for a place of safety
Seek for a place to hide
God turned his back on man
In divine resignation
Torn between two believes
Eternal life or termination?

On the fields of desolation
Eternal life or termination

Why won't you cover me?
I need your sanctuary
This sea I'm drowning in
Might be where end begins

As we drown in darkness
Weak and depraved
On our final journey
Too late to be saved
We've gone through places
Where the cold winds blow
Is this the end of it all?
I don't know, I don't know

On the fields of desolation
Eternal life or termination

Why won't you cover me?
I need your sanctuary
This sea I'm drowning in
Might be where end begins"
Surviving the Times,Nas,anger,"But that's the whole tragic point, my friends
What would I do if I could suddenly feel?
And to know once again that what I feel is real?
I could cry, I could smile
I might lay back for a while
Tell me what (what) what would I do
If I could feel?
I was young, I was surviving the times
Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine
Little Ray had an NXX, I was hoping I'm next
Wanting bracelets, never had a rope on my neck
Unless I was holding Taiyeh chain, Rest In Peace
Even though that night you flipped on us
You warned us
If you came back and we still on the corners,
We goners, moving on to
Move your arm in your watch
To another time on the block
'Cause this 40 Side Where they said Shorty rhyme
Tragedy, he used to come through all the time
I'm talking Juice Crew, not what the word define
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
That was my first crush, I bought my first mic
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
I was about mine, fantasize house-buying
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived
I was happy, just getting some answers
I ain't even know what a record advance was
I'm seeing hoes sex in the studio bathroom
With rap dudes, thinking wow she moved me
Same girl then, right now's a groupie
Back then, she was like the star in the movie
Large jewelry and expensive Gucci
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Eric B man looking like touch-it-he-shoot-me
You see, every time Ra didn't show
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
I wonder could they tell, how did they know
Sixteen years later, here I go
[Chorus: x 4]
What would I do?
I'm with Akinyele in the street, trying to get us a deal
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
Rebel of Hip-Hop coming through a white rapper
My boy MC Serch nevertheless
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
Now bugging because the label had just dropped Def Jam
Could you picture Russell needing a check, man
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Then, the roster's: Cypress Hill, Nas, and Fugees
Before I sold records, no promotion
The rap world like, what's all this commotion
Went plat', mad bottles I'm toasting
20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then
[Chorus]
Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
But back to the matter at hand
'Cause ten years ago we all strived to be twenty-five
Some cats didn't make it alive
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver's seat
Held myself down, just steering the wheel
Here I am, completed my whole record deal
[Chorus]
What would I do?
If I could reach inside of me?
And to know how it feels to say
""I like what I see..."""

The Roar of the Masses Could Be Farts,Minutemen,anger,"
Soft and understanding eyes of the young
Moving with abandon atop the green lawns
Malleable as luck allows, faking all the ties
Forced out in time
Needs expressions met
Improvised inventions lost in the way
Absolute the course which instinct betrays

Grinding in reversal outdo 'til done
Proper naked self solutions surround
In brightness be it real, blinding and free
Visceral gems hit pearlesque in flaw
Spark of the instant challenging the time
View the observer's plagiarizing hands

Straitjacket,Alanis Morissette,anger,"Something so benign from me
Construed as cruelty
Such a difference between
Who I am and who you see

Conclusions you come to of me
Routinely incorrect
I don't know who you're talking to
With such fucking disrespect
This shit's making me crazy
The way you nullify what's in my head
You say one thing, do another
And argue that's not what you did

Your way's making me mental
How you filter askewed interpret?
I swear you won't be happy 'til
I am bound in a straitjacket

Talking with you's like
Talking to a sieve that can't hear me
You fight me tooth and nail
To disavow what's happening
Your resistance to a mirror
I feel screaming from your body
One day I'll introduce myself
And you'll see you've not yet met me

This shit's making me crazy

Thy Horror Cosmic,The Black Dahlia Murder,anger,"Lord below, your abysmal horrors we call forth
Awaken -- rise up and cleanse this earth with fire

The taste of victory awaits our wicked tongues
As you sleep beyond the light your blessed idol acts agent to your will

For vast aeons has slept, lurking 'neath the haunted deep
Sea soaked perversion, arise
Named of the foulest tongue, his will ebbs within me
Beckoning -- what was shall once more be

In the house of the dead you lie and wait
Oh lords of black earth
Controlling the minds of the meek
Staining this planet with visions of murder and hate

For vast aeons has slept, lurking 'neath the haunted deep
Sea soaked perversion, arise
Named of the foulest tongue, his will ebbs within me
Beckoning -- what was shall once more be

We pray for the earth to open
Free you of your ageless tomb
Our knees bent in your worship
Oh great gold one, I scream for your return

Madness unhallowed
Ascending moon of darkness never to wane
Lurking without end
Behind life in time and space

An evil so vast
Beyond man's power to bear
An essence insane
Dethrone the sovereign -- and with your might reclaim

I serve allegiance to your will

Lord unholy, your horrors I invoke

Said so many things that I wish I could retract
I've got my issues, I've got my demons
Finished what I began and finally saw
It's how you use the knowledge you've been given
Stood tall when others would have turned and run
Put my work in when everyone quit
Claw and tear for everything I have
And I've only just begun

A lesson lived is a lesson learned

I'll make a gate you cannot pass
Taped to there loinclothes
A sign that says ""Why us?""
Flip yourself off but erase it when someone sees you.
""This, this is the worst vacation ever, I am going to cut open your
Forehead with a roofing shingle, Ohh Ohh""

Without a note

Don't Pray on Me,Bad Religion,anger,"A grizzly scene on my electron beam
Told a story about human rights
So all of Kings horses and all of Kings men
Had a riot for two days and nights
Well, the city exploded but the gates wouldn't open
So the company asked him to quit
Now everybody's equal
Just don't measure it
Well Hanson did it hester
And Mark David did it to John
And maybe Jack dit it to Marilyn
But he did it to South Vietnam
For beauty and glory
For money, love and country
Now everybody's doing it,
Don't do that to me
A bitter debate and a feminine fate
Fly in tandem like two precious babes
While the former gets warmer it's the latter that matters
Except on the nation's airwaves
And custodians of public opinion stay back after vainly discussing her rights
Lay hands off her body
It's not your fucking life
Now I don't know what stopped Jesus Christ
From turning every hungry stone into bread
And I don't remember hearing how Moses reacted
When the innocent first born sons lay dead
Well I guess God was a lot more demonstrative
Back when he Flamboyantly parted the sea
Now everybody's praying
Don't prey on me"
Supernaut,1000 Homo DJs,anger,"Practially every one of the top 40 records being played on every radio station in the United States is a communication to the children to take a trip, to cop out, to groove. The psychedelic jackets on the record albums have their own hidden symbols and messages as well as the lyrics to all the top rock songs and they all sing the sameain: It's fun to take a trip, put acid in your veins.

I want to reach out and touch the sky
I want to touch the sun but I don't want to fly
I'm gonna climb up every mountain on the moon
And find the dish that runs away with the spoon

I've crossed the ocean, turned every bend
I found the crossing near a golden rainbow's end
I've been through magic and through life's reality
I've lived a thousand years it never bothered me

I Am Hell (Sonata in C#),Machine Head,anger,"I am death
Arms held outstretched
I am hell
Born this mortal shell
I am wrath
Take this bloodbath
God sent me to kill you
What started out as wonder
The smell of scorched earth
It filled me with a sense of bliss
Inside my head the noises show they thundered
With cracking and hiss
One match
Killed the anguish
One act
Left me fulfilled
Destruction now the only catalyst
To save this soul
From these thoughtless kills
Where once a heart was beating
Nothing but embers glow
Our love it serves as kindling
To stoke this flames inferno
I am hell to thee
Down here all shall suffer with me
Die purified
Rise the ashes to the sky
Obsession born of young lust
Incomprehensible the feelings as they come to pass
But now betrayal slowly turns to blood lust
Through sulphur and gas
Ignite this crime of passion
Loves pyre is set a blaze
The charred remains of all
Compassion was the spark that lit
Your immolation
Where once a heart was beating
Nothing but embers glow
Our love it serves as kindling
To stoke this flames inferno
I am hell to thee
Down here all shall suffer with me
Die purified
Rise the ashes to the sky
So burn
I'll burn it down
I'll burn you down
So you'll never love again (again)
Where once a heart was beating
Nothing but embers glow
Our love it serves as kindling
To stoke this flames inferno
I am hell to thee
Down here all shall suffer with me
Die purified
In this the ashes of your immolation
I
AM
HELL
In the ashes of your immolation"
Piss Up a Rope,Ween,anger,"My dinner's on fire while she watches TV
And if you ever wondered what it's like to be me
She takes all my money and leaves me no smokes
Yells at my buddies and insults my folks
I'm breakin' my back, doin' the best that I can
She's got time for the dog and none for her man
And I'm no dope, but I can't cope
So hit the fuckin' road and piss up a rope

You can piss up a rope
And you can put on your shoes, hit the road, get truckin'
Pack your bag, I don't need the ag
On your knees, you big booty bitch, start suckin'
You ride my ass like a horse and a saddle
Now you're up shit's creek with a turd for a paddle
And I can't cope, piss up a rope

You can piss up a rope and feel the pissy dribble
You can piss up a rope and watch me giggle
For the last six months I've been packin' your bag
You can wash my balls with a warm wet rag
Till my balls feel smooth and soft like silk
I'm sick of your mouth and your 2% milk
And I'm no dope, but I've lost all hope
So hit the fuckin' road and piss up a rope

There's so much useless noise
That I can't take
I'm out of phase

We walk alone like motorists
Behind the bars and discotechs
Love is a product and sex is the currency
We're all cheaters if we can't win
Blood, liquor and the holy bible paint a picture of a
Kinder gentler world
An art that seems to have no ending
One that leaves us standing at the gates with broken wings
While our heart scan reports:
Access denied, access denied

Break

There's so much useless noise that I can't take
The sounds are getting louder everyday
There's so much useless noise that I can't take

You fucking parasite
Feeding off my flesh like a leech
Sucking me dry
Here's some head
Hope you get it in your throat
Hope you gag and choke
Your pale little face turning blue

Now you want it in your ass, as I spit in your face
Face down on the floor holding you by your neck
Do you feel like a wreck?
No, that's life, kiddo
Now shut up and swallow
(Swallow, swallow)
Shut up and swallow

You'll get nothing for free
Don't try to suck it off me
You always take you what you want
Now I just take what is mine
I'll get you after this
You tell of life.
It's up to you to fill it with substance
I'll play your game
A lesson of life: It's not what you want, but what you get
You'll feel it from within as I work my way out
Such a pretty girl, but such a dirty mouth

Now you want it in your ass, as I spit in your face
Face down on the floor, holding you by your neck
Do you feel like a wreck?
No, that is life, kiddo
Now shut up and swallow

Shut up and swallow

They are children playing with guns

Mining harbours, creating contras
The games they play, the lives they take

They bank their money in this country

A colonial trait that's much too old

The banks, the lives, the profits, the lies
The banks, the profits, the lives & the lies

I would call it genocide
Any other word would be a lie"

Harboring delusions of grandeur

59 times the pain, I could never be with you
59 times the pain

Never figured out eating 3 meals a day
When the people sit in their broken-down homes
Look at the photos from different eras gone by
Shows the changes and I hate them all

Can't say that I don't like it

Unchained tearin' your flesh we unfed
Flyin' through, like birds we takin' your daily bread"

Destroy what destroys you
In god-forbidden land
Resurrect the dream you've lost
Before you regret
Our souls may be darkened
But we see the light
The source of our inner strength
Is power that cannot die

Afraid of Me,Twiztid,anger,"I'm so, hidden and you're never gonna see
I'm cold, forgiven all because of my beliefs
I'm no, body that you ever want to be
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me
I'm so, hidden and you're never gonna see
I'm cold, forgiven all because of my beliefs
I'm no, body that you ever want to be
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me
Now you can try to sedate me, assassinate or just hate me
But there's nothing that you can do to me lately
Now I'm greatly accepted in the mind so I'm confused and intertwined
From being rejected so many times, I want to leave it all behind
So kind of you to pick up the album and give it a try for once
And run and tell your homies that these motherfuckers will die for us
So many questions, fingers pointing for answers
Suggesting that I'm the cancer that lingers inside the pasture
With green grass up to my neck, and situations that's too fast
To think about and most people can't dream about
A hundred million miles and every single second
And every time you hear this record I want you to feel me on every sentence
Reminisce from descendants of past treasures
We'll embark on a journey that'll stay alive forever
Plus I would stand over on my side of the fence
Regardless of the circumstances or the consequences
I'm so, hidden and you're never gonna see
I'm cold, forgiven all because of my beliefs
I'm no, body that you ever want to be
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me
I'm so, hidden and you're never gonna see
I'm cold, forgiven all because of my beliefs
I'm no, body that you ever want to be
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me
I am my own worst enemy
I'm not the smartest motherfucker and shit, I don't pretend to be
And why I am the way I am is not a mystery
My mind's not in proper working order or in therapy
The brain's confused and mentally abused
Life's been hanging on a string so what the fuck I got to lose?
And what the fuck I got to prove to you?
If you don't know me by now, you'll never know me
You can put that on my real homies
I got problems and they stack like bills
And I relate to the broken, bleeding heart love killed
And I awaited in the shadows, awake in the dark
Hoping to talk to the passed on, I'm falling apart
I'm such a mess and decisive, I'm fading away
I'm out of touch with society and living today
Never relying on my sanity, I through it away
To become the maniac that's got your attention today
I'm so, hidden and you're never gonna see
I'm cold, forgiven all because of my beliefs
I'm no, body that you ever want to be
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me
I'm so, hidden and you're never gonna see
I'm cold, forgiven all because of my beliefs
I'm no, body that you ever want to be
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me
Can you keep a secret?
Well I'm afraid world because they want me to die
can you believe it? But I'm still alive
And been floating since '95
With my chin held high but I'm so dead inside
Let the problems just roll and put them back into a pile
Because it's just a bunch of shit that I can't deal with right now
And I'm tired of always guessing and messing it up again
And the next day it's even deeper and I'm steady sinking in
I took a look at myself and came to grips with what I found
It was a vision of a child, disturbed and broke down
No soul, no heart because I have it away
No time for feeling sorry, I'll grieve another day
And all those tears are stored in storm clouds
That hover above me and cover the ugly
Continued to haunt me when I was feeling low
That's the same reason I hold on and never let go
I'm so, hidden and you're never gonna see
I'm cold, forgiven all because of my beliefs
I'm no, body that you ever want to be
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me
I'm so, hidden and you're never gonna see
I'm cold, forgiven all because of my beliefs
I'm no, body that you ever want to be
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me
I'm so, hidden and you're never gonna see
I'm cold, forgiven all because of my beliefs
I'm no, body that you ever want to be
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me
I'm so, hidden and you're never gonna see
I'm cold, forgiven all because of my beliefs
I'm no, body that you ever want to be
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me"
The Formative Years,Atheist,anger,"In the short time
That I have spent here
In this ghastly plane
I've come to find
There are so many things
That should be changed
Like the relationship
Between the elder and the youth
It lights the fuse that leads
To all our problems
And that's the truth

Ambition, floods our hearts
In a world in which
We must succeed
If it's only in our eyes
Connoisseur of Opportunity
Release your stubborn nature
Don't' electrify the seed
Rectify the need

We know you speak with them
You're close but very far
Communication is essential
Like the light to stars
No need to tell them no
No need to slap their hands
These are the formative years
You would not understand

"The Red, White And Blues",Defeater,anger,"That whiskey burns going down
Old man pour me another round
Cause it's my last night in town
And I ain't thinking of slowing down.
No, I am fixing to drown

Till I see the sun or I can't see
Cause I got the blues and the blues got me
I'm gonna make my momma proud
Her boy on the front lines
And just like my daddy done
I ain't afraid to die.

I ain't afraid to die.
I ain't no fortunate one
But I'm proud of what I've done.
Hardships, I've seen some
I ain't a coward I don't turn and run
I don't turn and run.

So I stumble home
Pack up my old memories
Pictures of ma
My daddy's flask she gave me
Keep it near your heart
She would always say
It's all he left
And that's where it'll stay.
And her leatherbound
Book of psalms and prayers
She would always read
With patience and care.
A short walk to the cemetery
To pay respects before I leave
1901 to 1943
I run my fingers through her name
And the effigy.

The sun is up
It's all I see
Cause I got the blues
And they still got me.
Yeah they still got me
I'm gonna make my momma proud
Her hopeful new recruit
And just like my daddy done
I'm gonna bleed red, white and blue
I'm gonna bleed red, white and blue
I'm gonna bleed red, white and blue
I'm gonna bleed red, white and blue
I'm gonna bleed red, white and blue"
Spine,Machine Head,anger,"Bitterness infested, justice is molested
Govern my contested ways
As a child arrested, as a man detested
Happiness inside my pain

You hate my life
Because you see my strife
Could never understand or try
It makes me mad
Because it makes me sad
But I don't care why

You fake it, mistake it
Fuck it away
Your lying is trying
My dignity

I see right through your soul
Can't help but feel this cold
But this city made me so

Life filled with deception, unwanted inception
Want redemption for it all
All my life frustrated, pushed, alienated
Wait for me to take a fall

My faith has waned
Because I feel the strain
In my eyes it's all gone wrong
We'll rise above
From this lack of love
It won't be long now

You fake it, mistake it
Fuck it away
Your lying is trying
My dignity

I see right through your soul
Can't help but feel this cold
But this city made me so

I'm not the only one
Can't be the only one

She Bathed Herself In A Bath Of Bleach,Manic Street Preachers,anger,"She'd walk on broken glass for love

Can't control my arms
Energy too strong, I feel
Hypnotize myself
Blood boils inside
For those who know, I want to be
As clear, as real, as I protect
Nothingness is all around
I hate the taste of your words
Every step I chose to make
Was just a kind of torture
I changed my ways
Now positive the fear became
I hate the taste of my lost illusions
I choose to live for the only
Reasons I fell on the ground
I want to try"

But there's none you can find
You beleive in something
That's only in your mind
You're looking around you
But hate has made you blind
And you've spent the last ten years of you're life
In this emergency

So please don't just sit there
Let's try to break out
From all the hatred
Suspicion and doubt
Try to change you're life
That is no life at all
Try to break down the imaginary wall
And if you couldn't be bothered
Well then, my friend, you'll fall
And spend all the rest of your life

For Whom The Bells Tolls,Metallica,anger,"Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say

For a hill, men would kill. Why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry

Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls"

Gotta take a stand and you have my blessing, alright

You gotta take the cotton out of your ears
You gotta start hanging on to all your affairs

The Saga Begins,Rakim,anger,"Yo, the saga begins, my eyes is the photography lens
Properly push pens, and show quality gems

If we follow the trends and keep count of the dollars we spend
I want a mahogany Benz, I want lottery ends
I want property, friends, plus my hobby is skins
If I decide we in sin, then my prophesy ends
But the God'll begin, watchin my odyssey spin
in the place where war be, based on a true story
Territory was made for me to pursue glory
Blast alone masses in zones have to be sewn
Every capacity blown, I'm internationally known, yo

Suspense that I supply intensify
Then commence as my daily events go by
You get involved in this, paragraphologist
Narratin novelist, market this, sound marvelous
I'm the star in this, which means the author's authentic
Most definite, every episode's a epidemic
So when you research, check it, here go the evidence
They represent with lyrical negligence for presidents
My science existed, without the fiction
Every inscription is a special edition

Yo, the legacy lives, let em see what the pedigree is
Mega-thesis, blessin these kids with extra features
The depth's deep as, the deepest sea is
Telepathy increases melody gets speakers, telekinesis
Ideas appear as clear as, pictures in movie theaters
Lyrics you hear it, devestating the way you ear it
So stay tuned for sequels, part two's and more
So soon you and your peoples can bumrush the store
The names have changed the game remain the same
How one came to reign on his claim to fame
No stoppin this I'm droppin this with hip-hop in this
And when the topic is topicless, then I'm writing the apocalypse"

Not Ready To Die,Demon Hunter,anger,"You've got a lot of nerve and
I've got a lot of fingers to point
While you were busy building knowledge
I was already right
I know a voice like yours is not a weapon at all
And even mine is not a chisel for a thickened skull
So you can chant your anthems to the deaf
And we can sit here and cry until there's nothing left
Or we can take our voices with our hands
Make like knives and make demands
We'll take our voices with our hands
Make like knives, we'll make demands
I'm burning bridges for the last time
I'm breaking habits for the first time
I saw my future today, it said I'm going away
But I still haven't sung the last line
On my way down
I'm not ready to lay, not ready to fade
I'm not ready to die
And everyday of my life I can feel it getting harder to breathe
With every minute ticking by, I'm getting ready to leave
I know a life like mine is not a reason to fret
But I've been busy making scars that you will never forget
If only thirty three years can save my life
I've had twenty three more to make things right
So when I'm taken to the sky and you're still here
You can clear your mind and dry your tears
I'm not ready to lay, not ready to fade
I'm not ready to die
When I'm taken home and you're still here
Just clear your mind, dry your tears

Because of you

The bitch is back again
So none of you are safe

Because of you
The winter feeds my heart
While summer blows and burns
My disappearing youth

My love is gone
Never feel again
Because of love
I feel nothing
Because of you
I feel nothing

Because of you
I'll never bleed again
The agony of pain
Will never bruise or start

Because of you
Our passion tends to lead
With all my lovers fate
With pieces from my heart

My love is done
Never feel again
Because of love
I feel nothing
Because of you
I feel nothing

Habeas Corpses (Draconian Love),El-P,anger,"I found love on a prison ship
I found love on a prison ship
I found love on a prison ship
I found love on a prison ship
I found love on a prison ship

Number 247681-Z, step to the line
*Gunshot*

Two types of people in this world to recognize
Conquered, and the one holding the rifle at the next in line
The crosshair in my eye is a vessel to God
The container that kept you around in a hole in the yard
Sail the cemetery seas, half the crew leaves then move on
You have no idea how right my head is screwed on
When I wake up and put this suit on, I feel escape begin
Expirations are needed, I facilitate the end

There are two types of mornings in this life I can surmise
I wake early in the first to help supply the second type
Technician of repetition clips in the numbest of traditions it's
The little wondrous blunders that can summon one's demise
I know the line to walk, talk softly, punch a clock, aim (pow) done
I see the shelter in contrition, best to limit wagging tongues
But today's a confrontation with a thought that's not assured
She's inching closer to my services and further from my world

I found love on a prison ship
I found love on a prison ship
I found love on a prison ship
I found love on a prison ship
I found love on a prison ship
I found love on a prison ship

Does this job ever bother you, darkly creep up in your conscious too?
Nope, in fact I'm so enamored with the standard
Of being handed a command to (pow), it's almost romantic
The lead giveth, I take it, if I didn't understand it
I'm saying during the tenure of your gig, have you ever herded a pris
Who despite the traitorous label, makes you nervous as a kid?
Maybe beyond a date with the lead, there's something else meant for
A prisoner with the beauty of 247290-Z
Oh God, you gotta be joking, I get it she's smoking
Go get a taste, I'll hold you down for thirty
She must be purty, you're open
Your secret's safe with me, go on a raping spree
I gotta couple numbers of my own, just return the courtesy
No, nah man, that's actually not on my mind
Somehow it's different this time, I mean
Should a creature so sublime and young really be in line for the gun
And am I the one to dispense it? She seems almost defenseless
And her eyes have the surprising effect of rendering me restless

You know, you look really pretty without handcuffs on
Without the dirt on your face

Like the piss and stench of the huddled traitors
Evaporates from the room
And in that moment I can see her truly, and she can see me too
Beneath the body armor and weaponry
My heart quietly thumps and whispers
""Drop the guns and grab her, now's the time to make your run""
Sitting in my transport as we slip through traffic veins
She doesn't ask me where we're going, only holds my hand and gaze
She's my only reason now, and my only hope to live
We pull up to the cabin way above this damn metropolis
Me and prisoner 247290-Z
Somewhere that is Soylent Green, we're living life instead
No more war on traitorism, only me and her
She can clean my gun and I could help her clean the floor
Back to something natural, we'll live off of the land
When Radon levels drop we walk the trails and talk and laugh
I tell her she's innocent, and she'll show me she's not
I kiss the number on her arm and lay her on the cot
I'm the first to touch her without gloves on
She's the first to kiss me without crying
Life before this was just dying
Me and prisoner 247290-Z
Away from all this violence, live inside each other's heads

Mean old girl behind
Her crazy eyes

We were good together
As good as it gets
I only wanted to help you
From the day we met

Now I'm sleeping on the couch
For months on end
You were more than my girl

Oxygen,Aesop Rock,anger,"I'm twice born, once and seven something
Once is the resurrection of honorable function
Been shoveling a coal as the engine's doctor
Long enough to see my silhouette acquire a permanent kink in a posture
The metenance of icicle spirit by the warmth of true endearment
Was, is, and forever will be a luxury
I'm a soubrette columnist fathering doom document
Cursed version of a certain Virgin Mary womb occupant
[Verse One]
I know swamp rats who never suckled oxygen purification
Sure it's blurry may have had them speeennnd breeezzzzze
Stuck until my friend leaves puppet for the plummet committee
Sputtering bum numb enough to stomach the city
Who's that hugging a silhouette of willows with a hill's crest pan out?
On the candy coated crab apples, sugar dipped deadpan outs
I got a plan, I'll turnaquet my quest
Defeat a needle into battling to mute the mess
With patience galas with absentee balance I shove in the button
Strutting to exhibit mankind's hostility function
With a, ppppppppp paling in comparison a methias Goliath
Live to riggedy frame in a wicked silence
I top and ate my nameless square then I bumped eyelids
With a Christ we saw the same thing through a second
What's that? The grand mosaic depicting historical glory in a legend
Nurse me through the time stick and stone mixes hex my fertile crescent
Now all's well, I'm laughing on the inside I swear
Just trying to keep my head above red tide despair
My imperfections pair off with buddy system symmetrics morbidly
So every second the discontent's locked accordingly
Let's turn mummy's shut up affection a berserk glory condition
And pray for the day a star child tugs the ribbon
Meddle in a two-hand grip when that spoon full of sugar medical chaser
Credible crasser antidote's terrible taste the
Water with a stolen soul pen left picture mad rhythm pinned
Never set a grin and fly health
Consider me a mobile advertisement for that hybrid plan of fabrics
I deemed practical, now is you is or is you ain't compatible
I feel a wind in my opinions plus hyper clutch
Crush one's ginger bread tenement awful,
It's like the date of Grado Methasawmill
A lifeline of spectacular expansion leaves the reaper
At the hand of what man's hand jokes
My friend's got a book about dreams, I look and laugh
I dream a book about my friends and still can't decipher the half
Ch-chatter boooox, now let a soothe sayer major
Cater to a king green battered on the brink of disease
I am, skin and bones, I am, sin and poems, I am, tin and chrome
You grin and groans fuck it I'm tinted when accrete zone
Blow the pedals off a dandelion trying to make my little gypsy blush
And felt as if I'd actually accomplish something
Fortify the bullies of the jokes soaking in treatment
Sit and watch the percentages teeter on the evening
On a ghost up in a fuse a lot second before the cock dropped
In the Styx and stared him down until he fixed it
Fashion, it's cool and all but what about God?
[Oh God, well he's the man, but what about reading?]
What, like novels, man that don't hold my attention, what about television?
[Television hurts my brain, how about walking in the rain?]
I hate walking, it's boring, how about some old fashioned gone fishin'
[Yeah, fishing's great but I can't stand hooking the bait, lets dance]
I've got too left feet plus motion sickness, how about breakfast?
[Man, I'm hungry, but that means I'mma have to borrow some money]
Let's fly a kite [Let's burn the generals]
Let's sell lemonade [Let's drink]
Let's poke a hole inside the tugboat, ease on back and watch it sink
[Naw, lets scare a pupil once a year just to shake the academy]
Casually note the blossom of phantom alignment strategy
[Verse Two]
I'll make the waterfall out of order in autumn saw the quarter
When the gods mimic the vintage knuckle drag sacked in a coffin
I affiliate my rag dummy appearance with a most cohesive spirit
Clattering the yesterday ain't shed a tear since
Hear me, wrote the Old Yeller community cartoon
The carousel balloon extravagant aware, inviting it
I'm swore to Adam and matter and saddling
Warhead thorax and abdomen to primitive horse back galloping
My index fingers rest in my talisman branded up in the jackals skin
One must pardon yee old common street detour
Weaving graceful through the prom directed column
Greater virus retreats to a lot in Valom
Bean stalk where the fiend walk and my name is mud
But that's got a ring to it so my swill welcomes the flood
I walk through God's practical joke on man practically broke
And if they raise my rent again I'll spend my nights practically soaked
Who spits silk dimensions with a noose looped by the raft?
After lack of reasoning jedi 3, 2, 1,
Oooh I'm hung, I've clung to hope but see you in hell
I'll be that clear blue icicle that simply refused to melt

Skull of a thousand dilapidated dream remnants
Here to convict based on a tin bucket of evidence

The profit of rage-the jihadist black flag
A dark standard raised-juxtaposing dyad
The scimitar blade-black flag of jihad

You true infidel the prophet you betray
With the jihadist blade
Feudal infidel, savage, the mind enslaved
Come rise the herald of a new dark age

Death's coda
You're no gods warrior
Extant dystopia

For you will discover that nothing is true but infinite human conflict
For do true prophets come armed with sword?

The Rich Man,Roadrunner United,anger,"Somehow
I think I'm going home
Even though my friends can't reach me
I don't know how I ended up alone
All I know is you can't save me
They only asked us to believe
They only wanted us to follow
I think I'm old enough to see
I think I'm going home tomorrow

I believe in sinners and hypocrites
Burning in the desert for a rich man
Liars and lunatics
Lead us to the slaughter for our last stand
Killers and idiots
Dying in the desert for a rich man
Sinners and hypocrites
Gather us together for the master plan

I didn't bother with my faith
How will my family recognize it
Somehow I think I'm going home
But I still can't comprehend it
I know I don't want to die
But I know dying will not end it

I believe in
Sinners and hypocrites
Burning in the desert for a rich man
Liars and lunatics
Lead us to the slaughter for our last stand
Killers and idiots

I know the truth is all a lie
My skin is cracking on my lips
I don't pretend that I can understand why we are doing this
My heart has bled a thousand times
How will I live with what we've done
The only comfort is the knowledge that I'm not the only one

Why am I here
What did I do

Dawn of a Golden Age,Roadrunner United,anger,"Moon child
Spawned of rage
Soon child
The dawning of a golden age

Four and twenty acts have passed
Since the pact was signed in blood
Now this fifth lustrum will surely grasp
The children of the holy
With music wracked like final gasps
From hearts that broken
Flood
Whilst ruby-wedding talons clasp
This silver anniversary

Moon child
Spawned of rage
Soon child
The dawning of a golden age

Vermillion rivers slither past
Racing roads to Shangri-La
Where a million souls aquiver ask
Small mercies of the holy
Like flowers plucked from crimson tar
On florid banks
The priests waft their scent through horrid bars
To incense the greater beast

Bereft of their seas of sweet dreams
He brings tidings of pain
War songs in the key of death
Sharpened through famine and plague

The knife at the throat of all murder
He wrote whilst in chains

And there was given to him a mouth
Speaking great things and blasphemies
And power was given unto him
To blaspheme against God
And them that dwell in heaven
And it was given unto him to make war with the saints
And to overcome them

And risen from imprisonment
With so many nations to tame
Past Caesars and Tsars are but lesions and scars
To the backs of beyond he reclaims
For what is not told nor writ bold to his face
Is now whispered to the torturer's cheek
And with the rapport whores and sorcerers make
His kingdom embraces both the Pope and the State

The suck and the fuck of the wait
And a glut and a covetous Satan
The suck and the fuck of the wait
And come what may
A glut and a covetous Satan
Pre-ordained

Päivä kääntyy ehtoon puoleen,
minä käännyn selin ja isken tulta;
koska jalkoja vieläkin paleltaa - mutta ei kauaa!
Ei askeltakaan! (ei sanoja!)
En löydä enää tarvetta (karata!)

We're travellin' a missile
Weavin' through your cornfields
Leaving behind a trail of amateur porn and orange peels
Navigating through this basement
That masquerades as a nation
Practicing my acetate masturbation
Watching the expressions on the faces
Of the ones designated to be the queens, kings, and aces
How many miles can you put on one soul
Before the smile starts to blend into one big bullet hole?

(Brother Ali)
Shoot through it as a unit with the best of my crew
Pumpin' melodies and memories too
My head's killin' me (ew)
Stomach empty, my bladder is full
Two year old son with Jaybird
Phone dry and missing me (?)
And I'm starvin' I'll bite your arm off
Saber tooth tiger, run the night with the sharp claws
In your back yard just to fuck with your gaurd dogs
Throw a brick through your shit, come cut the alarm off

I do my best to take advantage in bouts
Put one hand over the mouth
Still managing to shout
There's more said within the lines of your forehead
Then they could ever try to fine print on the inside of that warhead

Like a little lost junkie
Make 'em hot and jumpy
Trying to get that God money
Steering the van through the blizzards, the fanfare
Pivot when we visit
Spit victim if you stand there

Check your map of this picture, throw a dart at it
That's where
We took a room back for the kids and through a heart at it
Angry like a hostage
Kickin' like a little bitch in one of Dibbs' moshpits
Shifting through your city limits, trying to find the raw shit
Thread a needle with it and weave a world of heads together
'Til we get em carsick
Face full of war paint, strapped ready for action
Battle cry just trying to seek the satisfaction of the captain

Climbed over the side, closed his eyes
Took a dive into his famed inspiration for staying alive
Swam to the shore
Stepped upon land
Walked up to a whore
Grabbed her by the hand and said

Let the light in, Let the kids play, Let the people know
Let the roof burn, Let the girls love, Let the heat flow
Let the world turn, Let the curbs up, Cats Van Bags Yo!

Lock eyes with a thousand people at the same time
They mind believe in us
My style of graffiti is
Reason just the midwest sweat out of my shirt
And leavin' with my life essence embedded in your dirt

Spoon feed these issues to a new school of fishies
Swimmin' through a hazy shade of passion
Here they come, the hazled and has been'd

The finest imperial wordsmiths on the circuit
Two million smiles and runnin'
Stompin' tryin to flee the heat
Turn around shootin' at the monster 'til he's knees are weak

I came to listen
Then I save you
Then I make you my favorite position
Chasing this pigeon down the street towards the banks
Just in case my my traffic receives Jeeps and tanks

So let it be known

Nothing on the telly

Nowhere left to go

Is it a crime
To be young

We have some fun
They put us down
And tell us that we're wrong
Every time they sing the same old song
Here we are nowhere
Maybe that's where we belong
You know it's not

I'm looking at you

Won't change a thing
Must we only wait and see

Here Comes the Gravediggaz,Gravediggaz,anger,"You gotta keep saying it, he wants to
Say Gravediggaz, Gravediggaz
Come on say it with me, come on
Gravediggaz, come on

Gravy, yeah, uh huh

You don't pull on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the old Lone Ranger
And you can't fuck with me and my men, so check it out

Yeah, here come, the Gravediggaz
Yeah, here come, the Gravediggaz
Yeah, here come, the Gravediggaz
Pray for your mommy

Boom bit competition ain't shit
Fakin' the funk like silicon tits
Left on a level of a skill
Or jack the imposer like the Buffalo Bills

They come close but can't win or do a damn thang, huh
I'm merciless like Maine
As I get the wreck off, I navigate a course like Czechov
Soft MCs, you better step off

Will a villain ever learn?
I'm killin' like a mad germ, I burn MCs like a bad perm
Do not turn 'cause I got you on my infrared
Once I dead, I pop 'em like a pimple's head

I get up and get down like I was gravity
'Cause pains like cavity, thick like a salary
Flow with little or no skills I kill 'em
My shoes are illa makin' a mountain out of a molehill

Chill or your ass'll be tooken fast
Crossed in the style like Alice in the lookin' glass
You wanna see the Grym get raw
Ay-yo I bust your whole shits in your

My style's gravy, rough and real
Raise up the rugged on my Gravediggaz shield
That's how I deal with the fake frauds
I flow hard, yo hearthrobs'll get robbed

I come with the wicked one stompin' tons
I mud other crap as I wreck your town
Cock my bore to hell as we dwell
To a ludacris, Lunar Eclipse no to exit

I radiate gamma rays at random
I slam 'em, yo, quick fast like the phantom
Guard my gate with a passed down cape
You wanna escape and now ain't no one safe
Check it as I hit you with a boom from the trigga

Yeah, here come, the Gravediggaz
Yeah, here come, the Gravediggaz
Pray for your mommy

I learned to burn rap germs like antiseptics
Dem while eats, I piece a music living epic
Words like proverbs, blended braided
So on like a storm or song of King David

Potentially vital, only as the bible
Camel eyes used to worship the false idols
New form of literature, dance to the fiddler
Don't mean to riddle you God, I'm not the Riddler

On super the moon, no, wait for high noon
I'm the other space doom, I be entombed
I don't squawk like a hawk or stalk like a stork
But walk in New York, stay away from pork

Rhymes are by passion don't need the hassle
Swingin' everything 'cause I'm king of the castle
Niggas gettin' boggled, it scream and squabble
Gravediggaz got the paperback novel
So line by line you should read, take heed
Or you'll bleed and bleed and bleed and bleed

Yeah, here comes, the Gravediggaz
Pray for your mommy

Yeah, here comes, the Gravediggaz
Yeah, here comes, the Gravediggaz

Kem Khefa Khesef,Nile,anger,"Get back crawl away get away from me, thou snake
Be drowned in the lake of the abyss
At the place where thy father hath commanded
That thine slaying shall be carried out

Be far removed from the abode of Re
Where in you trembled
For I am Re at whom men tremble

Get back thou rebel
At the knives of his light
They words have fallen because of Re
They face is turned back by the gods
Thy head is cut off thy heart is cut out
Thou art put in chains

Crawl away Rerek snake enemy of Re Thou who escaped massacre
In the east of the sky at the sound of the roaring storm

Thou shalt not become erect Apep
Thou shall not copulate Apep
Opposition is made against thee
Ye whom Re hates when he looks upon thee

O Cobra
I am the flame which shines on the brows of the chaos gods
I am the flame son of flame

Get back thou who shalt be decapitated
They face shall be away, thy head shall be removed
Thy bones shall be broken thy tail shall be cut off
The earth god hath condemned thee

Let no evil opposition come forth from thy mouth against me
For I am Set who can raise a tumult of storm
In the horizon of the sky
Like on whose will is destruction

So sayeth the terrible one"
Every Time,Pennywise,anger,"Every time I turn around I see places that look so unreal
Every time I try to say exactly how I feel
And when I look at you I see a different side each and every time
Try to find another place there's nothing I can find

I wanna say feel it slipping away
Happens ever time you're in my mind
I want to say things that to you are true
But I'm not sure about you

I'll never be who you want me to be
Gotta take some time in my life
Won't ever know until I try
I just gotta know why

Wouldn't you like all the best things out of life?
All you got to do is just try then run for your life
All you gotta do what's best for you
All you gotta do is get through, run for your life

A silence speaks to me a voice that seems so far away
The unheard cries of wasted lives I hear them everyday
Left in this sullen room I search for things that I can find
To hold on to to help me through nothing can be divined

I wanna say feel it slipping away
Happens every time you're in my mind
I want to say things that to you are true
But I'm not sure about you

I'll never be who you want me to be
Gotta take some time in my life
Won't ever know until I try
I just gotta know why

Wouldn't you like all the best things out of life?
All you got to do is just try then run for your life
All you gotta do what's best for you
All you gotta do is get through, run for your life
I just gotta know

All of these images start crumbling from my memory
I search my mind go back in time to the way things used to be

I wanna say feel it slipping away
Happens every time you're in my mind
I want to say things that to you are true
But I'm not sure about you

I'll never be who you want me to be
Gotta take some time in my life
Won't ever know until I try
I just gotta know why

Run for your life"
You Ignore Them All,Raised Fist,anger,"The conflict has been fierce from the start.
Too many people, a lot of brain, a lot of heart.
Building the foundation of violence to be.
Bloodstain on the VCR, radio and the TV.

Acting like we didn't see this coming.
Ignoring all the bombings
And the war with the king
Who's pulling the strings.
He's on top of the food chain,
But without the wings.
Without the wings.
Without the wings.

I can't (live with this)
Need to take a stand
(We need to resist.)
If nothing really happens
I'm truly ashamed
And I might start a riot
And take full blame.

Sending your judgements on the weaker, poorer,
Sicker. You ignore them all because you're smaller.
And you want to put yourself up in the sky,
Can I ask you why?
[X2]

I know I should be better
But I can't take this shit
I'm just a stupid guy
I'm the first to admit.
You say you have no part.
I'm not gonna buy it.
The same type of lie,
I got a big supply of it.

Acting like we didn't see this coming.
Ignoring all the bombings
And the war with the king
Who's pulling the strings.
He's on top of the food chain,
But without the wings.

You'll Find Safety,Architects,anger,"Find comfort in yourself
Begin to believe, before it's over
Lift your head up
Everybody's talking
Prove them wrong
Before your time is up
You keep it all in, and you never find a release
Take comfort in yourself
And only know how to find safety in yourself
Find your faith and find your hope
You'll find safety
I know it's hard to look up when everything's falling down on you
It's hard, but you can make it
Begin to believe
I know it's hard to look up when everything's falling down"
Those Who Cannot Speak,Shadows Fall,anger,"Scream out against the glass
The sound reflected unable to escape
Desperate to connect
Lashing out at words that fail to appear

Bound in silence
The failure of sound never learned

Instinct urges on
As the mind creates its own obstacles
Waging internal war
Between the objects and the abstract

Bound in silence
The failure of sound never learned

Bound
Bound

Scream out against the glass
The sound reflected unable to escape
Desperate to connect
Lashing out at words that fail to appear

Bound in silence
The failure of sound never learned

Eloquence of the inner voice
The poetry of the condemned
A stream of consciousness
Never to be understood"
Put Your Head Out,House of Pain,anger,"I rip shit like a bow when I flow
And I score points with the joints that I throw
Cause I flow deadly
I'm no punk see
I break backs, make tracks and get funky
There's no one to run to cause nobody cares
MC's drop to your knees, say your prayers
The luck of the Irish is about to kick in
Prepare to die and notify your next of kin
I'm goin' all out, buck, duck and call out
That's how I'm livin, punk you better stall out
This is the House of Pain
To come inside is insane
Chorus
I'll put your head out (4x)
Jump up spread out
I'll put your head out
I'll put your head out
Put put your head out
Jump up spread out
I'll put your head out
Hey what up punk?
I'll put your head out
Who steps the booze
When the hoods want to take a cruise
They're feelin' the effects of the booze
Ain't no clues to hold with them fools
Who got smoked even though they scrat crews
You got bruise but I got the booma
Trigger to blast ya askin the bull
Take my life shit, I'll take you to school
In the do what's the difference if your think of droppin Jews
Carbon copy think you're so cool
Stop dreamin' and hallucinatin'
You're caught up in a piece of pain
Click click, punk, now you're thinkin' oh shit
Quit while you're ahead before I fill you full of lead
Chorus
Blessed with the gift, and gifts with the rhyme
I never say quit when I'm out to get mine
It's live and let die, sit back and get high
Smokin' a fat blunt, waitin' for some punk
To act up like he's got somethin' in him
Then I grab the mike and start spittin' out venom
Coughin' up headstones, blowin' out headphones
Steppin' to me, you'll wind up in the Dead Zone
It's nothin' personal, that's how it goes, G
Step up with beef, and you'll wind up losin' teeth
Cause I don't give up the mike that easy
Step back, this ain't government cheese, G
You can stand in line, but you ain't gettin' it
Talk all the shit you want, but I ain't sweatin' it

Still don't give a fuck (give a fuck)
Sportin' all black kahkis with the mother fuckin' cuffs up
Smokin' Hella trees, tryin' to make a couple G's
So a thug can get back on his feet
Mean muggin', steady thuggin'
And I'm tryin' to find the hoodrat's all about fuckin'
Still loked out
All my dawgs from the past, dead or smoked out
Still tryin' to come up on a lick for a phat ass ride
So I can drop the top, and parlay through the east side

You buy that shit, you can keep it we don't want it back

And if you don't have heart, don't expect to have your shit tight
There ain't no room for the whole-hearted
We give a fuck where you at, who you with or how you got started
Fuck you and everybody in your clique
If you don't run with the hatchet or claim the psychopathic

I finally understand what all this is
How it was all possible
Now I see, good Lord, how we must look from out there
Our addiction is evil

Vinne Paz:
My brain's on another level than yours
You can only comprehend half of what my memory stores
I only walk through the heavenly doors
And never try to see the penitentiary walls
I walk barefoot on the equator
With the mental acumen of Bob Lazar
My frame can't be explored by your radar
My name can't be absorbed in God's quasar
So why try stay around this hell
Twelve thou'
From all the twelve tribes of Israel
They call me Ishmael
Lord of the seas
I take your life quick
Gone in the fuckin breeze
You don't deserve to breathe
Your brain thoughtless
While i remain in the same spain fortress
But pain's gorgeous
And love is torture
And anyone who tell you different is a martyr

I'm from the pits of hell
Escapin from an Egyptian cell
I dedicate this
To the saints that
To envision jail
You fuckin kids are frail
And we're the purest form
And the biology of magic is a gorgeous psalm
My deepest thoughts are strong
And I'm unbreakable
You wanna overstand
You're humanly incapable
My appetite for blood is gruesomely insatiable
And I'm a righteous thug that's brutally defacin you
And you don't want no war
It ain't a game daddy
I spit a bunch of slugs into you fuckin frame daddy
You just a fuckin crumb
My click is hustlin dumb
I spit a rap at you to liquefy your guts and lungs
But the devil made me do that
Fightin for the rights of Islam
Armed with two gats
But y'all knew that
We was comin for blood
And your body the perfect specimen to put in the mud

(Movie quote)
Were not evil because of the evil we do
We do evil because we are evil

I civilize the savages
While you support gay marriages
Evil demons and the jesus of the nazareth
I keep my blade more sharper than a cactus is
I keep grenades in my parka for the pacifists
And you can't lie to God cousin
And you cant lie to the great master fard cousin
It's a facade cousin
They wan't to lie to you
They want to tell you that the governments reliable
They wan't to tell you that islam is dangerous
When everybody know the christians are to blame for this
Cause it's the truth deal with it
But you complain every time i'm real with it
I'm bout to kill critics
And them take 'em to war
And teach em how to put they love and they faith in allah
Or I'm breakin they jaw
Or i take 'em to burn
Cause thats the only fuckin way that the pagans will learn"
Act Of Contrition,Shadows Fall,anger,"I feel the cold hands upon me

Memories right from the haze
With sobriety comes recollection

My betrayal
My betrayal

It is not the pain inside yourself
That tears the deepest wounds

It is the pain you create
That consumes your very soul

I drift along suspended in shadows
I drift along suspended in shadows

A specter of despair
Built on good intentions

The ancient echoes crawling out from my insides
No way I, I cannot be all these things to you.

Twist the Knife (Slowly),Napalm Death,anger,"Gut level, below it all
Out of duty
Just here
Feeling like a knife's being twisted
In the hole of how it is
False hope, an inch of pride that died
When I left to hide
From a non stop battering
Of conditioned opinion
Rest assured but not assured
All is well
But I think we've dealt with the fear
For far too long

Unborn suffer (unborn suffer)
Unborn suffer the norm
Born to this I think not
I stand against
Till the shit drops

In the hole of ""How it is"""

There's no one to know me
On the far... side
I don't care about your side
You don't care about your life
I don't care about you

And when it's gone
I won't be there
All these things as they pass
I'll just fade away
And the time can tell me that
We're all the same

I try not to hate you
Not try to hate me
But it just won't go away
I see all I can see
I'm hoping for a brighter day

Watch as you go
Watch as I wave goodbye
There's no one to know me
On the far... side
I don't care about your side
You don't care about your life
I don't care about you"
Sun Ra,dEUS,anger,"Would you go outside?
I asked you to leave
I had enough of this ruckus
I wanna sleep

You say you're feeling lonely
I got to agree
I feel it coming slowly
Slowly to me

Here comes
Here comes the night train
And here comes
Here comes the night train

Making a point in conversations
That I'll never hold
Protect myself from rumors
That I'll never be told

Choking on beauty
I usually don't even see
I'm living life through someone else
Looking at me

Here comes
Here comes the night train
And here comes
Here comes the night train
And here comes
Here comes the night train

Now, all that evil thoughts I had
And all the harm I ever did
Stand right before me, eyes wide open
Where were they hidden?

I'm gonna rip it up
Bring it down
Send it to hell
Oh, somebody teach me something new
Somebody as guilty as me
Can break this spell

'Cause here comes
Here comes the night train
(Make it stop, oh, I can't make it stop)
And here comes
Here comes the night train
(Make it stop, oh, I can't make it stop)
Here comes
Here comes the night train
(Make it stop, oh, I can't make it stop, it's on again)

Get up, put up, open your eyes
Let the black blooded vein
Come to your brain
Angels 'round here don't sing
They have a curse upon me
(Make it stop, oh, I can't make it stop, it's on again)

Get up, put up, open your eyes
Let the black blooded vein
Come to your brain
Angels 'round here don't sing
They have a curse upon me
(Make it stop, oh, I can't make it stop, it's on again)

Get up, put up, open your eyes
Let the black blooded vein
Come to your brain
Angels 'round here don't sing
They have a curse upon me
(Just make it stop, oh, I can't make it stop, it's on again)

Get up, put up, open your eyes
Let the black blooded vein
Come to your brain
Angels 'round here don't sing
They have a curse upon me
(Make it stop, oh, I can't make it stop, it's on again)

The shame, the lovers
The tricks, the blessings
The rebound, the future is used
It feels like you used it up

I look at you, I pity you
I dream of you, what are you?
Drop a name, leave it there
Bruise a heart, leave it there

Pay the entrance, leave it there
Get some style, cut your hair
Shouldn't be this, shouldn't be that
Take the heat, take a free kick, man

Try to get a grip on these times
'Cause the harder that I chase
The harder you're running
You don't have to be
Impatient for something that ain't coming"

My gat talk for me, blat! Whattup homie?
For bitches who don't know me, they wanna blow me
'Cause the shit I floss with sayin' a lot for me

I came into rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
I'll serve anybody like niggaz who hustle uptown
Coke price go up, capsules come down
The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found

Niggaz who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracks
They keep it on 'em, right there in they ass crack
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrap your fuckin' head like a Hindu

Look, I ain't goin' nowhere, so get used to me
OG's look at me and see I'm what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot Dice when he broke to sold soap

The thug, that pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to a whole bricks
Nigga ain't in his right mind, goin' against me
My picture's painted through words that make a blind man see

Y'all niggaz don't want no parts of me
I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me
If you gonna make me catch you on the late night
Pop shots with the fifth and slide off with the six

I'm not a marksmen while sparkin', so I spray random
Not a pretty nigga but my mom's think I'm handsome
I hate to hear, ""He say, She say"" shit
Unless, he say, she said, ""She on my dick""

It's no coincidence, niggaz who fuck with me get shot up
I do a Cali style drive by and tear ya block up
You soft duke, you puttin' up a crazy front
I stay with the Mac, 'cause niggaz tried to blaze me once

In the hood they like, ""Damn, 50 really spitted on 'em""
""You heard that shit?"", ""Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em""
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none
You just a small player in this game, play a part son

Scream murder!

Murder!

Murder, murder!

These cats always escape reality when they rhyme
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt with dimes
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
Nascar, truck with a crash bar, and TV's in the dash, pa

See 'em in the five with stock rims, I just laugh, pa
I catch stunts when I ain't tryin'
I ain't lyin', I sit Dom P till I spit up
Keep my wrist lit up

Get outta line, I get you hit up
Now if you say my name in your rhyme
You better watch what you say

You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away
Now here's a list of MC's that can kill you in eight bars
50, umm Jay-Z and Nas
I'ma say this shit now and never again

We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
The games you playin', you get killed like that
Actin' like you all hard, you ain't built like that
See me when you see me nigga, WHAT?

The Lie You Bleed For,Heaven Shall Burn,anger,"This is the war you called
And I'm the one who came to judge you
Too soon your gods will leave

Long for the peace of surrender
Just stare into the void

Welcome the newborn slaves
Disfranchised and betrayed

Just feed your new found hate

A force nothing will break
Just burn it
Just burn it down

It's in the air you breathe
An everlasting poison
An order of deceit

Faint echoes of deception

Vaan ei yksi raato tee vielä kasaa

Villainy Thrives,Trivium,anger,"I can feel it aching within every bone inside me
I can feel it breaking out, retaliation, released

Can't wait to choke the life out from your baneful bodies

If only I could afflict you
Hurt you in the same way that you hurt
I just want to exact reprisal, retribution calls
The only way I depict you
Is that your redemption's undeserved
Meet the vessel of your reprisal, retribution calls

It's not that I take life for granted

Innocence dies while villainy thrives

How can you harm a living thing, thinking that it's your right?
How can you defile a life, deprive it of innocence?
For too long you have gotten away with murder
A fitting justice would be your painful execution

The Bite and Sting,Defeater,anger,"I've spent days in this trench in the snow
Just my gun by my side.
It's cold and wet and you're all alone
Up keeping watch at night.

The bite and the sting
The bitter cold brings
Reminds you that you're still alive
The hope and the pride
That we all hold inside
Seems to break when another boy dies
The bite and the sting
The bitter cold brings
Makes you wish that you weren't still alive
The hope and the pride
We all hold inside
Seems to break
Seems to break.

We ain't seen no germans for days
We're just tired and sore
And it feels like I'm wasting away
So I drink from my flask to stay warm.
Every bomb miles away
Every faded engine cry
Still makes your heart start to race
Keeps you praying at night.

It's too quiet and too calm
For something not to be wrong
So we sit as brothers in arms.
So we wait and we shake
Hear the roar of the tanks
And the gunfire of the oncoming storm.
The ring in our ears
And the cold rush of fear
Overtakes us with the enemy in sight.
I stagger, but don't falter
I aim and pull the trigger
And we fight, we fight, we fight.

But it all happens too fast
The blur of the sweat in my eyes
For every man killed
Seems 2 of my friends fall to die
I'm down on my knees
Feel the pain in my gut
And the snow is covered in blood.
Crawl to my captains side
With his head on my knees
Says ""see to it that my grave is kept clean""

Awake in a hospital bed
Just rows and rows and rows of dying kids.
And I know
That my whole
Infantry is dead."

The Act We Act,Sugar,anger,"I'm watching you walk
As you walk that distant way
Take that thing away from me
Take away most everything

I couldn't say I'd blame you
But you should never look in back
You wouldn't be to blame
If you couldn't take it back

Hours slipping by as you watch
The worlds collide
And now you're nothing more
Than another passerby

The dark it turns to light
In a distant flash of night
I'm rolling with the tide, I confide
The act we wear it thin again

If affection holds you back
Oh, then what is left to hold
If I could find the answer
To that question then I'd know

The thoughts that clutter up your mind
And leave me feeling drained
And walking, pacing up the walls
Across the floor again

And all the things I haven't seen
Once the final curtain has been raised
The act, we act is wearing thin
The act, we act we under my skin

The words, the words we said goodbye
The words left choking in my mind
The act, we act is wearing thin
I think we wear it out again

Another big explosion
Leaving you hoping
That something that once held you down
Could leave you feeling on the ground

The confusion that persists
Decisions that you guessed
The one to stay and watch this
The one you might have missed

All the things I haven't seen
Once the final curtain has been raised
The act, we act is wearing thin
The act, we act we under my skin

The words, the words we said goodbye
The words left choking in my mind
The act, we act is wearing thin
I think we wear it out again, now

The act, we act we under my skin, now
The act, we act we under my

Remains of the slain, a dead body wasteland
There is no escape, he holds your fate as the death rate climbs to the
Fullest extent
One man left, sherif bereft, faces the stranger with intent

On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains will always sho for all
Time
Expired
Big iron
Both die

On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains will always sho for all
Slain"
Goin' Down,Melanie C,anger,"How come I didn't see
You were making fun of me
How dare you change the rules
You made me look a fool

Well, now you're gonna see
The last laugh's not on me
What am I gonna do
To get my revenge on you?

You're goin' down
Goin' down

Was it just another lie
Or did I just breathe a sigh
What else can I do?
I was so into you

With all this bad luck I've had
My karma must be bad
You've played your little game
Oh, what a shame

You're goin' down
Goin' down
Goin' down

I'm singing it loud and I don't care
I'm singing it proud everywhere

Now I feel no remorse
My life is back on course
From this little hitch
I have become a super-bitch

But don't be afraid
By that confession I've made
I am not a whore
I have gone hardcore

You're goin' down
Goin' down
Goin' down
Goin' down

I'm singing it loud and I don't care
I'm singing it proud everywhere
I'm singing it loud and I don't care
I'm singing it proud everywhere

You're goin' down, goin' down
You're goin' down, goin' down
Ha, yeah"
"It's Dylan, You Know The Drill",Boys Night Out,anger,"An I.O.U. tattoo
Strung along the finer rip and tears of your heart.
And it is there to keep you together where we're all falling apart

My conscience drifts and sleeps in shifts
Trading off between my open hand and swinging fists
And this alcohol, my wrecking ball,
Keeps me talking to the angels buried in these walls

But, Contrary to counter culture
I don't care if the killing stops
Or if suffocation claims my lungs

We, walk a nightmare line
Wide awake and dead at the same time
We, walk a nightmare line
Wide awake and dead the same time

This ringing room has been raped and ruined
Completely torn apart by the few who think that they'll find you
But time and fate, those things i hate
Both have their ways of playing off the winters weight
Were both older and seven snowfalls
Worth of colder earth has left us reaching

We, walk a nightmare line
Wide awake and dead at the same time
We, walk a nightmare line
Wide awake and dead the same time

(At the same time)

The cellar door is coming up, coming up
And we've had time to lock it up, lock it up
I'm feverish i'm burning up burning
And i pray to god there's time enough, time enough
You know that i love you, But now i just can't shut you up, shut you up, so now i'll have to chop you up, chop you up
And I'll just wait till I get caught"
Never Leave A Job Half Done,Pedro the Lion,anger,"Blood stains on the carpet
Blood stains on my hands
Drag her toward the kitchen
Hide the evidence

Oh the toil a lie can bring
That quitters never know
But lies can be the perfect things
If they never show

The crisis that posed a question
Just beneath the skin
The virtue in my veins replied
That quitters never win

She almost ruined everything"
I Punched a Lion in the Throat,Pulled Apart By Horses,anger,"One man's adventure ends
Where another man's adventure begins
With the wind in his hair and the strength of ten bears
He bites whatever the future brings
The mountain range beckoned his pride
A kingdom with mysteries inside
The beasts paved the way for the victor day
As our hero began one last fight
I punched a lion in the throat
Ultimate power!
Maximum life!"
Some Of These Times,Raised Fist,anger,"As I walk through memories
And at the end of these
I've burned a lot of pain to see you within
Deep powdered my skin and it's (burning)

And I wanna break through to you
Try to speak to you (and I)
And I seem to get to what's right
But you're not listening right

When you went through my head
Turned it upside down
Fuck you, sick of you all the time
(I'm sick of you all the time...)

And some of your shit, reaches my evil side
And I can't deny, some of these times
I wish you would die

Listen up, All the time, Suck it up
You just cannot see it

Listen up, All the time, Suck it up
You just cannot see it

Why can't you learn to read the sign
Read between the lines
Closer to what I want to say
And now I totally feel

Instead I have to put all this in rhymes
Some I seriously am gonna buy
Does it make you feel fine

When you went through my head
Turned it upside down
Fuck you, sick of you all the time

Dedication is essential to succeed
Anticipation is all you need

How we fill ourselves up with the energy to remain

You play in a band, you want to expand
But you misunderstand
You're aiming at fame, you want to lay claim
But you should be ashamed

It's not about acting like a rock star at night

Struggling to get into a fucking nice review
Looking for a camera lens that can capture a picture of your crew
Still the same need for fame and a stage name
I cannot explain the feelings I have for you

Feeding the clothing store, so unsure when we're on tour

Self-inflected fears

Voices calm will be never heard
In this mode who will change
Bantised in our minds so absurd
Is this the world sublime
Into pools of paranoia we're fading with
Reality drained by lies we are al inhuman
Introspective vanishing

Sterile thoughts now upraised in subhuman
Majesty bodies numb still enchained
Where am I in hell of our dreams
Wrong wrong I'm in the now the vain reality

So it seems we're dying yet content
Worship our chrysalis stage since when are
Lies devine

Since when

This is now degrade indulge
This is us servile obliging

Swallowed by our hunger for mendacity
As this dance whirls deeper into hate

Trapped not in dreams now time has killed

Better Than This,Salt The Wound,anger,"I've shed these tears a hundred times.
The bottles are broken, my well runs dry.
All these painful words make this much harder.
You have no place here, I've left and so should you, should you.

These chains that bound me from this place.
Tonight is the last night you will see my face.
Left alone I've wandered in this place all night.
This has to be the only way to make this right.
Surely if I fell from these...

Left alone I've wandered in this place all night.
This has to be the only way to make this right.
Surely if I fell from these...

I've held these tears a hundred times.
The bottles are full and its my time to shine.
Would you believe me if I told you...
It was my time to die.
I've wished for this all night.
So show yourself, I will fight, I will fight.

Come at me with everything with everything you're made of.
Come at with everything you've got.

Come at me with everything with everything you're made of.
Come at with everything you've got.

All my life, I've waited for the day,
When I could just drive.
And get away from this place.
I need to get away from this place.
I know that I am better than this.
I know that I am better than this"
As Thick As Thieves,Dry Kill Logic,anger,"Now has come the time
Indifference born because of lies
Now no matter what you find
This is the end of all the lines
And when it's taken all away
What will you do or will you say
That can erase all the pain

So you can start to rebuild again
Focus
In your life do you lead or follow?
What you feel is it joy or sorrow?
Taking pleasure in others pain
As it's calling out your name

And though I want to hide
When it finds a way
As the pressure burns from the inside
And though I want to hide
When it finds a way
As the pressure burns from the inside

You'll find when all is said and done
Will you have lost or have you won?
And did you fight or did you run?
Now

So you can start to rebuild again
Focus
In your life do you lead or follow?
What you feel is it joy or sorrow?
Taking pleasure in others pain
As it's calling out your name

And though I want to hide
When it finds a way
As the pressure burns from the inside
And though I want to hide
When it finds a way
As the pressure burns from the inside

Now as the dreams come and go before my eyes
I see the strength and weight of resolve
For all the lying the truth shall remain with overwhelming force
The same as it ever was

And though I want to hide
When it finds a way
As the pressure burns from the inside
And though I want to hide
When it finds a way
As the pressure burns from the inside"
Sunlight,Raised Fist,anger,"There is a storm in my heart that tears my inside apart.
It's not so smart standing in a corner when it's time for us to,
Start up this engine that took us this far,
Not reaching for the stars, you know how we are,
And we will keep it that way, just make the feeling stay,
And when we're down, we must say that this can brighten up our day.

This is the sunlight that brightens up my day.
Stepping up on stage when everything feels dull and gray.
And we can't keep this inside, how we're feeling this time.
You're half of it so we cannot quit,
Keep building it up with brick after brick.

And when we go out on tour and return home
We'll be asking for more of what they have in store.
Like I said we're bored when we can't see you
Dance on the floor, under the stage and scream for more.

This is the sunlight that brightens up my day.
Stepping up on stage when everything feels dull and gray.
And we can't keep this inside, how we're feeling this time.
You're half of it so we cannot quit,
Keep building it up with brick after brick.

Plastic Bomb,Poison Idea,anger,"The lie is so real, I almost believe it
Conceit flows like sewage
How could you conceive it?
Shake my hand, look me in the eye
Smile and think of ways I'll die

Plastic bomb, plastic smile
Fake commitment, blood soaked style
Wrapped in a fur, trapped in a cancer
The swansong's over for the littlest dancer

Mistrust so explosive, apathetic corrosive
When I ask for it straight up
False face is compulsive
Try to stand tall, falling face down

Law and Order,Stiff Little Fingers,anger,"Everybody's down in the center of town
We're doing nothing wrong we're only hanging around

Laugh at your appearance and the clothes you wear
Call that justice, just isn't fair

I'm talking 'bout their law and order
They don't do what they ought to
Law and order
There's no justice in it, none

I had a friend who was lifted by the law
Lifted and then shifted and dumped on the floor
They treated him like shit

Kicked him in the head and then laughed when he bled
Spat in his face and pulled his hair
Call that justice, just isn't fair

I'm talking 'bout their law and order
They don't do what they ought to
Law and order
There's no justice in it, none

I'm not trying to say we're always right
No one's saying that it's black and white
All I'm saying is we don't agree
I don't think like, you don't think like me, I hope you never do

Yes

And that's the way they try and run this land
How they hold you down and keep you in hand
You're just a pawn in their game

You're just another number, you ain't got a name
You just a little punk y'know they don't care
Call that justice, just isn't fair

I'm talking 'bout their law and order
They don't do what they ought to
Law and order
There's no justice in it

Murder Sermon,Whitechapel,anger,"Father I have sinned
Forgive me for I don't know what I do
I have become devoid of faith
I am devoid of faith
As I mutter these words into his ear
His hypocritical eyes show me the origin of fear
Suddenly it seems he has lost all faith
In the one who's faulty life he helped erased
He tells me that he can make things right
I take his inverted symbol of everlasting life
And brand it on his flesh, in between his eyes
This is a cold blooded crime
But it just feels so right
The upper hand is mine
And so is his life
On this cold night my sermon be preached before his majesty
Now overthrown to be silenced by violence
This is not the devil's work
This is a murder sermon, proven to be real
Murder sermon
Murder sermon
On this cold night my sermon be preached before his majesty
Now overthrown to be silenced by violence
This is not the devil's work
This is a murder sermon, proven to be real
I cannot be changed
You're the one to blame
Stare into the face
Of the one you can't save
So now you've taken all you can ingest
I rip your still beating heart from your chest
Look me in the eye as you take your last breath
I hope your soul never rests
I cannot be changed
You're the one to blame
Stare into the face
Of the one you can't save"

And I'm tickling the trigger make it laugh from its gut
You would think I'm a comedian the way it erupts

Nigga what? I represent the ashes and dust
All that's sittin up in ya chin that's got ya stuck in a rut
You can fire, hold your fire, son, I'm smokin you up
You can whistle your desires even Buddha got snuffed

Nigga now I'm standing on the corner of wow
Exclamations pointed at me 'cuz I'm gettin' these nouns
Got these kids inventing adjectives and gaining renown
'Cuz I am nigga, I am

Nigga please, the earth, the air, the fire and the seas
Third dimension, fourth dimension, fifth dimension with ease
Oh, the chicken never thought I've got ya smokin' them trees
Ask your front door what my sawed off got you snortin' them keys

Hey, ain't no need to stop that
Hey, ain't no need to stop that
Hey, ain't no need to stop that
Hey, ain't no need

God and pussy, objects of desire
And ill repute some rather seek up high
Than dig and grind that inner truth
The angel of my eye

A bit too fly to substitute
With any other form than the Messiah's black Mariah
Mothership, grandmother moon and sea
The wave and form of beauty born of Eden's apple tree
And every single Adam stands erect and prays to be
The follower she offers sweet communion, holy union

Let me see you run it just like that
Move your hips from side to side
Come forward, push it back
Let me know firsthand the land of glory that I lack
I surrender all to you if you surrender back

Holy God where'd you learn to squeeze it tight and then
Move it slow enough for me to question everything?
You slowly start to tremble heaven's walls begin to sing
Tsunami ever after cosmic slop on everything

Hey, ain't no need to stop that

That's What It Is,Immortal Technique,anger,"OK, let's go, talk to 'em, holler
Don't you get tired of hearing niggas say that shit? All the time?
Why can't you shut the fuck up and rhyme nigga?!
Yeah, yeah, used to run around getting my fight in the streets on
Back in the day before Harlem had a green zone
What good is a good education with no direction?
Like the right to vote with no one to vote for in an election
Like a gun with no bullets in the clip for protection
Like the crowd packed in the front without the midsection
Used to live robbing and stealing and being reckless
It took time for my mind to put the ghetto in perspective
I used to live in the back, of a holding van
Used to be offbeat, like the white girls' shoulder dance
I wrote rhymes acapella, no beat, behind bars
Shed blood to make it, like the story behind scars
I used to be a battle champion, in the meanwhile
Before some of you little fuckers learned to freestyle
Prematurely senile, underground prima donnas
I was Oliver North during Iran Contra
Cause I, never snitched, and that's backed by evidence
I learned it by watching you, don't ever forget it bitch
Cause everybody knows how the government do
They never snitch on themselves, but they want you to snitch on YOU
Evolution from Australopithecus
Primitive commercial shit to hard-core lyricist
Your wax is useless
Rappers are dropping like Icarus
Technological revolution, nigga picture this
(Motherfucker what?)
Yeah, I told you what it was, but this is what it is now
Lyrical bullets, packed to the top of the clip now
Treat it like a robbery, I'm shutting this shit down
Fellas put your hands up and the all the women strip down
That's not misogynist, you ostriches, cause I could just, apocalypse
Talk politics to the populace
Or challenge what the market is
With militant caucuses
That'll smash the spirit of Hip Hop out the sarcophagus
This is the curse of Tutankhamen, I bring the drama on
I'm sinful, I eat you, broad daylight on Ramadan
Hip Hop, reparations, now we taking back Delucci
Don't tell me you spent it on coke, like Danny Bonaduce
We're tired of being on the outside, looking in
Wondering what the fuck Hip Hop would've been
This is what it is, as opposed to what it used to be
And this is your corporate tax ID eulogy
Dominant speech is the new breed, that won't let you breath
I'll make you die for what I believe
So we got nothing in common
There ain't no comparison
You got beef with niggas, I got beef with Aryans
White power Nazi European Americans
Rapid Poverty pimps, and fake vegetarians
The resurrection, ripping a ball through the record (wrecking?) section
Flight connection to the gentry board of all guerrilla lessons
Fuck a middle man distributor, I got a choice now
This ain't Volume 1., I got a grown man's voice now
Toured the country four times over, I'm older and wiser
Poisonous words, you'll find strychnine in my saliva
(Motherfucker what, bring it to 'em raw)
I told you what it was, but this is what it is now
50 caliber bullets, I don't need a clip now
Fuck your private jet nigga we shooting the shit down
Bomb wall street and make the stock market dip down
I told you what it was, but this is what it is now
you the shit nigga, I don't care about shit now
I play the role of Abraham, idols get ripped down
Melt the ice caps, and make all of this shit brown
(No one out there can fuck with me)
(Motherfucker what?)
(I speak that real shit)
(To smash the airwaves)
(I don't want to tell you motherfuckers again)"

White Noise,Stiff Little Fingers,anger,"Rastus was a nigger. Thug mugger junkie.
Black golly gob. Big horny monkey.
Pimp pusher coon. Grinning piccaninnies.
Send him home soon. Back to the trees.

Black wogs. Black wogs. Face don't fit.
Black wogs. Black wogs. Ain't no Brit.

Ahmed is a Paki. Curry coffee queer.
Ten to a bed. Flocking over here.
Tax-sponging canker. Smelly thieving kids.
Ponce greasy wanker. Worse than the yids.

Brown wogs. Brown wogs. Face don't fit.
Brown wogs. Brown wogs. Ain't no Brit.

Stick together we'll be alright me and you
The only colours we need are red, right and blue.

Paddy is a moron. Spud thick Mick.
Breeds like a rabbit. Thinks with his pick.
Anything floors him if he can't fight or drink it.
Round them up in Ulster. Tow it out and sink it.

Green wogs. Green wogs. Face don't fit.
Green wogs. Green wogs. Ain't no Brit.

If the victim ain't a soldier why should we care?
Irish bodies don't count. Life's cheaper over there.

Green wogs. Green wogs. Face don't fit.
Green wogs. Green wogs. Ain't no Brit.
Green Wogs. Green wogs. Get 'em boys.
Green wogs. Green wogs. Turn up the white noise."
Built For War,Megadeth,anger,"Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Listen, I didn't start this believe me, I will finish it
You called down the thunder too late now there's no way out
Nothing is gonna stop me until then better watch your back
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
There is no retreating I will cut you down to size
You will beg for mercy a bad seed, you're as good as dead
Yield to new dimension Hell's coming, better say your prayers
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?
What do you think your fists are for?
One day you will face me and see the terror trapped inside
Final retribution torture and pure punishment
Vengeance running so deep a dungeon of agony awaits
Fear not as death surrounds you
Bitch all you want, but here it comes
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?
What do you think your fists are for?"
Stray Bullet,Organized Konfusion,anger,"Verse one: pharoahe monche

Let the trigger finger put the pressure to the mechanism
Which gives a response for the automatic *bang*
Clip to release projectiles in single
File forcing me to ignite then travel
Through the barrel headed for the light
At the end of a tunnel with no specific target in sight
Slow the flow like h2o water
Visualize the scene of a homicide a slaughter
No remorse for the course i take when you pull it
The result's a stray bullet
Niggaz who knew hit the ground runnin and stay down
Except for the kids who played on the playground
Cause for some little girl she'll never see
More than six years of life, trif-le-ing
When she fell from the seesaw
But umm wait, my course isn't over
Fled out of the other side of her head towards
A red, range, rover, then i ricochet
Fast past a brother's ass, oh damn, what that nigga say
""Aww fuck it"", next target's margaret's face *bang*
And i struck it
Now it's a flood of blood in circumfrence to her face
And an abundance of brains all over the street
Shame how we had to meet *bang*
Dashin, buckin, greet by fuckin family
They follow behind me in a orderly fashion
Bashin through flesh i'm wild
Crashin through the doors of projects hallways
To deflect off of the tile
I'm coming for you little girl
Once inside i shatter your world
Swirl, no more dreams no hopes when i spray
You better pray, to the pope or the vatican
Before i go rat-tat-a-tat again
I'm mad again brother somebody's mother will be sad again
But, whose blue skies will turn grey

From the attack, of the mac-11, i'm a stray, bullet

[Nobody seen shit, nobody heard it -- 4x]

Verse two: prince poetry

Gun balls of fire, i'm travelling at higher speeds
To proceed to penetrate flesh, hitting the splint
After splitting the chest of a queens fiend
Age of pagers shredded to pieces from the glock 9
And it's hollow tips, it releases the polices
In back of the ambulance
Blood loss as i shift across your chest
Arrest, rupture, i mess up ya, slasher
Shall i bust ya liver, faster, blood pours *bang*
Now it's up to the master, boom, as i crash open the doors
Thank me for spraying the operating room
The body still consumes me, doc had to remove me
Mmm lord, why do they use me? *bang*
I'm takin individual for keeps hobbes
So peep the cops, in the ghetto bustin shots for props
And when i hit, shit *bang bang bang bang*
Soon you forgets-me-not
Cops tried to explain to his pops what i done
I flip up the hollow tipper and i'm not the one
And as a human i'm the surprising one
Prince po i flow the ripper, either way
You never, ever know how i'm coming
Metamorphasizing, rising in turbulence
Condensed into a bullet, pull it, now i'm making moves
With no sympathizing, uhh, so take a hit nigga, sprint *bang*
Onto the scenario, i'm at a party with o
A lot of honies parlay and the dj's playin the fudge pudge flow
Five niggaz come up in the club for a rub
[Yo o peep it, oh shit o duck (oh shit!, oh shit!)
*Pop pop pop pop pop* *woman screams*]
Another hit, another struck
Here comes mr. stray bullet
Five, the tip, getting my jollies from the screams of the ripped
In your chest, then i flip
Nip your liver, blood flowin like a river
Money starts to shiver then i give a delivery of burns
Bruises fake shoes is your renaissance
No response your moms is out cold
Figure i'm bigger takin your heart nigga at twenty years old
Stray bullet"

Kept u walking wondering in time
Yeah
I keep on thinking the same old thing, but then again what can I say?
I keep on trying to live my life, I keep trying to find a better way!
Well as everyday goes by I'll try, but I don't know if I'll make it through
But I'll move along and push on until I do
Because everything that you'd tried to build in time
Well that's everything you'd tried to hide
Well that's everything that you want to believe
Your motivation puts you where you'll be
What a way, don't waste away in time!

Well I'm seeing through the eyes of a modern man that I don't know
Should I try to find? Could I buy the time? I don't know
Well stand together, we will forever, gotta bet we'll be okay
Wide-eyed reminisce, what a blissful good ol' days
So here we go, through eyes that I don't know
Will we move along? Time will only show,
Because it's everything that you want to believe
A revelation, find a way to see all those memories are not put up on the side!
Here we go
Think about the promises that kept you walking wandering in time
Whoa!
Don't you know they kept you walking kept you wanting
Kept u walking wondering in...
Hey!
When you look around the world and the scenes,
All the means, little things, what it means to you
When suddenly, no warning to mourning,
What you think takes a total different point of view
What it means, little things, all the means,
World scenes turn around and take a look at you
You never know when you go, live it up here we go!
Got a lot more living to do! Hey!
You don't face tomorrow what a way to waste away in life
You're taking for granted all the little things you'd never realized
Well I'm 21 today, how many more? How should I know?
Counting down the days here we go!
Because everything that you tried to build in time
Well that's everything you tried to hide!
Well that's everything that you want to believe
Your motivation puts you where you'll be

Marshall, I can call you Marshall, right?

Good, sit the fuck down for a second
Okay

Do you just fuckin' hate me?
Hate you?
What the fuck have I ever done to you?
Your last record, we got lucky
This D12 album is fucked
What's wrong with it?

I don't wanna rape my grandmother
I don't wanna have sex with pitbulls
I wanna roll on dubs, I want throw bows, I wanna rock prada
Rock prada?

And who the fuck is this bizarre guy?
What do you mean
Do you need a cat-scan?
Where the fuck did you find this guy?

Desolate Spheres,Obscura,anger,"I close my eyes and the sun goes out
Hold a breath and all of the creatures fall dead
Cover my ears and the universe goes silent

Not a water drop
Not a heartbeat
Not a sound from a songbird in any of the 4 corners

I swallow the stars until they burn like coals through my eyes
My outline glows against the night sky like an eclipse of the sun
And sparks follow each of my movements like a shower of meteors

I light up the sky with the Aurora
Comets appear before dawn

He greets us at death in that quiet place that is faint in our memories
That place that has always been there but we can't quite remember

When you cross that bridge to the other world, open the door and step through
Step through the stars, swim through the gate
Touch the very boundaries of the universe"

I cannot count the bloody cost
I can't believe this wretched soul
Come penetrate all this loss
Come on and kill this sense of life
And be the one who is denied
Now show me one more upturned knife
And fill the emptiness inside

Be mine, sister salvation
Juke joint Jezebel is coming for my cremation
Be mine, sister salvation
Closer now, see the revelation

If I could leave my burning skin
That has been used up in your sin
Is there a tiny part of me
Untouched, unsoiled by misery

Be mine, sister salvation
Juke joint Jezebel is coming for my cremation
Be mine, sister salvation
Closer now, see the revelation

I am the city that will lie
You are the one that blame passed by
This is the place where I will weep
The loneliness of sweet conceit

Be mine, sister salvation
Juke joint Jezebel is coming for my cremation
Be mine, sister salvation
Closer now, see the revelation

See the revelation

Pressure,Swollen Members,anger,"You can see me on the top you can see when we drop
You can meet me on the block, we'll stop and talk
We do not get thrown we don't stop
Whether or not we up on top, we still rock
You can see me back on top you can see me when we stop
You can feel it when we rock, we got shit locked
We do not get cold we feel hot whether or not we up on top, we still rock
Madchild:
I'm a stun gun, pills 'til my tongues numb
I stay home don't ask where I come from
Conquer from beneath I sparkle when I speak
This bug me on the in the inside fuck it I'm a geek
A lovely individual hug me because I'm miserable
This wizardry is dismal drugs make me invisible
I've risen from my physical frame you can't touch me
Top boy that rock but it still got ugly
Prevail:
Dusty the country roads take me home to the place that I belong
Lost skeleton bones, locked in the closet deep family secrets
Discover this recovery my brothers in sequence
Ever had to dance with the devil in pale moonlight
Snakes in the grass but the scales don't move right
Fight when you need to bite when you have to
Run no never stand ground then we smash
You can see me on the top you can see when we drop
You can meet me on the block, we'll stop and talk

Virtuoso piano solo play Mozart
Vocabulary colorful like feathers of a peacock
Operating theatre put your head upon a butchers block
Rise from my own grave eyes nuclear holocaust
Astronauts t-minus arc of the covenant
My part spreading sick art that starts on this continent
Confidence ensures there's no formidable adversaries
A savage land and a band of terrible mercenaries
Program your lives like the wives of Stepford
Voice remains immortal and survives on record
Hannibal Lector pour myself a glass of Chianti
This is my Divine Comedy the finest since Dante
Cape scrapes the floor dark prince the Impaler
The order of the dragon Prevail no failure
Slain all the vain overcame with my sabre
Maintain and let the blood reign explain my behavior
You can see me on the top you can see when we drop
You can meet me on the block, we'll stop and talk
We do not get thrown we don't stop

You can feel it when we rock, we got shit locked
We do not get cold we feel hot whether or not we up on top, we still rock
Madchild:
It goes:cracked halo horns on my helmet
Little doll crawl in cherry red velvet
Burning Man in the house of charm
Chemical to the mouth but not to the arm
My tastes spinning out of control
Your face two eyes with a whole
Suicide watch, king of the strippers
Glorified hookers smash your glass slippers
Nothing can tempt me, everyone empty
I get high on the road when they let me
Trade craftwork off exotic substance
Some want to carve out my heart still love this
I'm trying to hurt myself, still smoking
But I'm a afraid of blood won't cut my wrist open
Told you that I loved you, I was just joking
You can't hurt my heart it's been broken
You can see me on the top you can see when we drop
You can meet me on the block, we'll stop and talk
We do not get thrown we don't stop
Whether or not we up on top, we still rock

Infinite Rotation,Obscura,anger,"Mass, energy, space and time
This is the way the world ends
Chaos of Aeon into the void

Behold the star shining
Bright behind the Universe Gate
Cool waters sifting
Bitter memories away

Whistling golden sand
Comes to rest so bright
In the invisible oasis land
A desert drought so tight

Among the pyramids of Egypt, in a run
The spider weaves a net
False radiance streaming from the sun
Foul richness leaving all to fret"
Рюмка Водки На Столе,Григорий Лепс,anger,"Ночь по улицам пошла
Звёздной поступью цариц
Слов и чисeл простота
У небесного моста
Раскидала перья птиц

Не забудутся никем
Праздник губ, обиды глаз
Забери меня в свой плен
Эту линию колен
Целовать в последний раз

Только рюмка водки на столе
Ветер плачет за окном тихо
Болью отзываются во мне
Этой молодой Луны крики

Нелегко тебя отдать
Парусам ветров и птиц
Может, даже не понять
Может, даже не узнать
Среди тысяч женских лиц

Пусть глаза мои молчат
Молча смотрят на луну
Если кто поймает взгляд
Поторопится назад
Сам не знаю почему

Только рюмка водки на столе
Ветер плачет за окном тихо
Болью отзываются во мне
Этой молодой Луны крики

Болью отзываются во мне
Этой молодой Лyны крики"
Specialist,Sage Francis,anger,"The one that I'm with thinks sex is a beautiful thing
And that's simply adorable
When my time is affordable
Dimes pay the price I get abusive and that's the truth
It's just a fucking shame this is how I choose to communicate
Excuses I produce have their roots in the music I make
She's not a fan nor am I famous
I may just change and adjust when I branch out
Leave, get off my damn couch and achieve
What I dream about leave my house hand out my keys
To the sleepless beauty who failed math class and can't count her Z's

The tree dies
She says that she's mine she's my proprietress
Can't hold on to most of what I owned
Besides she likes to kiss and that's cute
I hug her till I start to hurt her
She wants to dance to my pulse but I've got heart murmurs
A shark circles our lifeboat till its fin folds
The monster we created might choke in clothes
I'm naked walking tight ropes without big toes
Couldn't see this with the night-scope bid my skin glow

Fallen
Calling for a safety net
The great white might drain me of my life
Bite into my veiny neck where dreams are falling asleep
Could dry up once she sees that I bleed off beat
Head over heels cause she's tripping on her own feet
That puzzled look on her face still isn't complete
She gives bits and pieces of herself
While I'm breaking myself open I pour my contents to her shelf
Pardon me but is that me wearing my heart out on my sleeve
With razor sharp teeth gnawing at my wrist how beautiful is this
The most beautifulest thing in the world
Is making up words when I have none else left to say to a girl
Making her curl up in a ball in a corner of my eye
Taking a time out I don't want her to cry
I don't ever want to be considered the sort of guy
Who says, ""I just might break your face tonight""

I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire blow me away, blow me away
I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire blow me out
When I send you love poems in the form of smoke signals

Over average marriage materialist mister righteous
A savage miscarriage of just us just us
And a dust that never settles
I'm restless spread some metal to make it weep
Cause discussing the ugly nobody wants to fuck with
Don't touch me
Under appreciative with a with a hundred weaknesses
What do I need to live?
The blood I bleed is thicker than the skin I shoot people with
Need a fist to the air
Pretend to make believe she cares
To open up old wounds and usual bruises on my ego up here
I'm a low self-esteem engine in need of a horsepower
Out of sleeping powder
Dark clouds follow me with heat seekers
I need a colder shower
To showboat when exposes my phonetic quest
Cause it won't float if it turns out these are permanent echoes in his chest
I think its best to turn the reverb down
Kill the delay
Get me the fuck out of this cave

I could paint you pictures all day
I'm not gonna pander to Neanderthals that way
I'm not gonna pander to Neanderthals today
The one that I'm with thinks sex is a beautiful thing
She thinks I'm something special
She's my specialist
More beautiful than sex
Cause only something like sex
Makes something so lovely turn ugly and fuck up shit
I'm holding a sleepless beauty pageant
On my shark-infested waterbed until it's punctured

I spread my love, spread my love, spread my love until I pull a muscle
I spread my love, spread my love, spread my love until its see through
Spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire
Blow me away blow me away blow me away blow me away

I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire blow me out
When I send you love poems in the form of smoke signals"

Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold lies .

Razorblade,Blue October,anger,"In the day by day collision
Called the art of growing up
There's an innocence we look for in the stars
To be taken back to younger days
When there was no giving up
All the people we held closest to our hearts

Yeah it is you that I remember in that glowing
It is you that took my first away from me
It is you I set my standards to, to every walk of life
I haven't met another you since you were with me

Sing with me
A brief bout with a razorblade cut me
I freaked out, thinking people didn't love me
I watched closely as the you I knew forgot me
In letting go, I am so proud of what I've done

In a way, I failed religion
I spit the wine from mouth to cup
And I reached for something more than just your God
Uncle, you spared not your children
And while your praying hands were up
There's no forgiveness for you, you sick fuck!

Because it is you that I remember in their bedroom
It is you that took their first away from them
It is you they set their standards to
You wounded them for life
You were a preacher and suppose to be above men

Sing with me
A brief bout with a razorblade cut me
I freaked out, thinking people didn't love me
I watched closely as the you I knew forgot me
In letting go, I am so proud of what I've done

And I carried on
On

A brief bout with a razorblade cut me
I freaked out, thinking people didn't love me

I wanna be proud!

When I've said that stones won't bleed

They've been dreaming all these years
All these years I've been hurting

To everything I see

Have you ever seen
The weight of the world
Crushing someone's soul
You will see me in hell cos
I have opened myself
For this god of emptiness

I have painted it in my flesh
So that the whole world can see
There is something very cold in me
They don't want to believe
I've said stay away from me
From my sick morality
My life goes on without your love
Without your prayers now

Have you ever seen
The weight of the world
Crushing someone's soul
You will see me in hell cos
I have opened myself
For this god of emptiness

Read my scars!
Read my scars, it's okay for me baby!

I won't be taken in by their promises, no
I'm gonna try on my terms this time

Why don't you try it? You got nothing to lose
A boring job living from day to day
Do something different try to break away

Качели,7раса,anger,"Летели к черту облака с большой скоростью
Я знал, что должно случиться осенью
Глаза и волосы мои выцветут
А твои станут черными с проседью

Как больно осенью горло сжимается
Как жаль, но я разучился плакать
И не умея словами все это высказать
Упал, упал всем телом в осеннюю слякоть

Я умираю на качелях
Я ненавижу этот спорт
Как вы любили куда смотрели
Что наше небо кто-то стер

Расчеты компьютеров оказались неверными
В кострах красно-желтых сгорело последнее лето
Мне кашлем твоим окна в комнате вышибло
Да я стал суеверным слишком, наверное

А люди по-прежнему верили в праздники
За хлебным мякишем не видя большего
В надгробных надписях так мало спорного
Не жаль реального жаль иллюзорного

Я умираю на качелях
Я ненавижу этот спорт
Как вы любили куда смотрели
Что наше небо кто-то стер

Я умираю на качелях

Как вы любили куда смотрели
Что наше небо кто-то стер

Forced Life,Chimaira,anger,"Images still in my head of you dead
I wish I could take them away instead
I sit in my room alone and cry over my loss
Will anything ever be the same?

I wish I could imagine you happy
A life of ecstasy that would be good enough
To stop the pain that lingers
In my heart I know I would be content

Yeah, it's your forced life
It's your forced life
It's your forced life

Doesn't it feel the same to you?
Doesn't it feel the same to you?
Doesn't it feel the same to you?
Doesn't it feel the same to you?

I sit and wonder
While you ponder of pathetic items that bring you happiness
Those things that put a smile to your face
Are the things that kill me inside

I know deep down you have a good heart
But why am I never included in all of this?
I take you in rise you up
Yet my soul stays untouched?

Yeah, it's your forced life
It's your forced life
It's your forced life

Take the Mirror,White Lung,anger,"I'm tied to the seat
Stuck with your feet
Coiled tight, dead around my neck

We'll breathe when we're rotten dead

Wipe that look from your face,
I'll drop you back from where you came
Wipe that look from your face,
I'll drop you back from where you came

I want away from you
I want away from you

Today the plan
Is caught in your hand
I can't tell you where to turn
The trees are gone
Tucked up the dawn
We won't wait until you learn

Wipe that look from your face,
I'll drop you back from where you came
Wipe that look from your face,
I'll drop you back from where you came

I want away from you
I want away from you

Floaters In Mud,Sepultura,anger,"Stuck in the ground

The mind floats around
Crashing back and forth, never really stopping

Turn around and try to face yourself
You may think it looks like someone else

Look from outside, they don't heal
I'm passing through, shaking hands
Eyeless, shit-faced, they're not real
Mud in the brain, all insane

Turn around and try to face yourself
You may think it looks like someone else

Raw display of pain
No shelter refugee

Мне не уберечь головы
И я бросаю свой меч для того, чтобы лечь навсегда
В кровати травы

Твоего рта овал зияет, словно провал
И я так сильно устал видеть бег твоих глаз
Я не ожидал, что не смогу устоять
И, сражённый, упал враньём твоих фраз

Такая наглая ложь
Что я не в силах понять
Как можно так врать?
И я от злости
Забыл, как дышать
Как дышать. Как дышать

Один кричит ""белый"", другой кричит ""чёрный""
А на деле серый - идите к чёрту!
Чаще верю глазам и, всё реже, речи
И липким враньём здесь каждый блещет

Гордо задранный нос, всё как будто всерьёз
Он всегда прав во всём, а если что - не причём
Но из этих речей правды только два слова
Я опять закипел от того, что снова

Такая наглая ложь
Что я не в силах понять
Как можно так врать?
И я от злости
Забыл, как дышать
Как дышать. Как дышать"

And I didn't find out in time

We were betrayed, betrayed, betrayed
Betrayed, betrayed by rough trade lies

We quit our jobs and got all set to fly
Your promises had us riding high
But it's a dirty rough tough trade we find
""Yeah we agreed, but you hadn't signed
Sorry, son, gonna have to throw you
Our lawyers say we don't even know you""
Music is money, kids are no-account fools
You trade in us, we get betrayed by you

And you're sitting there in you're London office
Snug and warm
And you think that you've won but
Just remember this is just round one
We're gonna do it our way
We're gonna make it on our own
Because we've found people to trust
People who put music first

Why can't you tell us the truth?
Why did you lie to us?"
Dread Prevailed,The Red Chord,anger,"If you had not committed such acts a curse like me would not be sent upon you.

Now the day of dread has come.
Disfigured there faces? Nothing will save you.
You have the nerve.
You will be added to the pile of friends behind you.
As we storm the ramparts.
Your flesh will be my earth.
Fell the voice of thunder.
The time of dread ash come.
Feel the weight of millions of crashing down on your kingdom.
Armies of million.
I am the law! The bodies fill the void.
You think your sly? You're not.
Mountains and homes crumble.
Your death will be mine.
Bodies lay broken.
Penance fills the air.
The wind will take it all away in time.
All the false icons turned to dust to persecute for the cruelty.
The greed.
Old man speak for yourself.
Not for me.

You don't listen
You don't even try very hard
Your good intentions
Well they don't seem to go very far
And now we're going tit for tat
Until somebody draws blood

I'd beg forgiveness but I know that your will is strong
And there's the fact that
You're the one that took someone on the side
No no no no no
There's no difference, those omissions bear the sting of the past
Your indiscretions from the start determined if it would last
And now I'm standing on the verge of maybe drawing the line
And no one's going to sleep tonight

Save your soul before it's too late

Inside you the hunger never sleeps
You're always, you're always gaining more sympathy
You're something, something that makes me creep
You're now reaching supremacy

You don't know the word called shame
You don't even have a clue
I just wish that someone
Would shut your face for good

How low can you go with this
You sleazy son of a bitch
You've crossed the line of decency
But in the end we'll enjoy your tragedy

Inside you the hunger never sleeps
You're always, you're always gaining more sympathy
You're something, something that makes me creep
You're always gaining more sympathy

I Should've Known Better,Nickel Creek,anger,"It's been a long time comin' and the card were stacked.
It's been a long hard road to hell and back.
Your love meant trouble from the day we met.
You won every hand, I lost every bet.

Now you'd think that I should've known better.
Now I think that I should've seen it come.
My heart sank when I read that letter.
It sank like a stone, it sank like a stone.

A cup of cold coffee, yesterday's mail.
A bad love like this is always bound to fail.
Your love meant trouble from the day we met.
If you want your things, they're on the front step.

Now you'd think that I should've known better.
Now I think that I should've seen it come.
My heart sank when I read that letter.
It sank like a stone, it sank like a stone.

All alone in my kitchen.
All alone in my head.
Somethings you can't take back, once they've been said.
I don't know what this love is for.
All I know is I don't want it anymore.

You cover the first two and I'll take the sack

Off to discuss, just what's going dizzy
Everybody got it, aight let's get busy
Run up in the bank bitch, hit the deck
Yo bust money, and get the keys off his neck (come here)
We on the clock, three mintues until we finished
Feds are on the way, but I'm tryin' to see spinach
In and out, duffle bag across the back
Extra long sports coat to cover up the mack

What can I do, but go on livin'
Tree in front of the condo, I'll throw on a ribbon
Life goes on, that might sound wrong but hey

Day to day, death is a possibility
The way I play is a vest stops you from killin' me

House parties with gangbangers showin' up
Represent your hood, everybody throw it up
They say, Cube, get on the mic, nigga, blow it up

I used to be lyrical, political
But now you want it sugarcoated, like cereal
First I met Dre, then I met Yella
Dr. Dre made me rap acapella

Me and Jinx did a show at Dudo's
With K-Dee, I think it was two shows
Then Dre introduced me to E
Cruisin' down the street in his red Jeep

He said, ""Yo, niggaz, we should flip it like this
'Cause them 'Boyz N the Hood' like the gangsta shit""
I put the pen to the pad, young nigga was raw
And told the world how we felt about the law
It was real

In that trailer park, just bumpin' our tape

Jerry Heller tried to make his escape
I had to bounce, while other niggaz got raped
Same niggaz turned around and said fuck me
No, fuck you, 'cause I'm down with Chuck D

And I'm 'bout to do a movie up, a classic
When I hit the screen, nigga, it was magic
Never thought I'd see Eazy in a casket
Thanks for everythang, that's on everythang

I learned a lot of game from you
I like your son, he got his name from you
I tell him everythang that he need to know
If he ask my advice, I won't think twice, homey

Everybody wanna know my next move
Fans all around say, ""We love you, Cube""
I wanna take time to say, I love you, too

I love all my fans 'cause they know I'm a man
And not a little boy or some fuckin' play toy
A lot of niggaz say, I grew up on you
And let me know if anybody fuck wit'chu

'Cause you talk a lot of shit about the red, black and blue
And how they treat a nigga called Katrina, did you see her?
White folks worry 'bout them fuckin' misdemeanor
While black people dyin' in that God damn arena

Just because I'm actin', nigga, never stop rappin'
It's in my blood, homey, I'ma keep the party crackin'
Money keep stackin 'til they put me in a casket
Who you think you fuckin' wit? Here's another classic

The Repellent Scars of Abandon and Election,Deathspell Omega,anger,"The feeling of destroying the capacity for inward peace, an insane dance
With the angels of innocence amidst thorns and in frenzy, the warmth of
A divine blessing, a daringness which prevailed over any imaginable fear
Hovering on the brink of a voluntary act of contrition, but soon all pales
Besides the cry this shattering truth wrests from all fellow men, there is
More to it than suffering and sounds of suffering, it is a process that only
The extinction of a divine soul could terminate. The eye can outstare neither
The sun, nor death... if i sought God it was in delirium and in the delight of
Temptation.

The idea of Salvation comes, i believe, from one whom suffering breaks
Apart. He who masters it, on the contrary, needs to be broken, to proceed
On the path towards the rupture.

Nothing of what man can know, to this end, could be evaded without
Degradation, without sin,- is it no burden to bear the repellent scars of
Abandon, of election?- it leaves but a state of supplication and deserted
Expanses, an absorption into despair. The existence of things cannot enclose
The death which it brings to me; the existence is itself projected into my
Death, and it is my death which encloses it. Am I deranged? Over and above
Quietism! Nurtured by the multitude of man's misfortune, a thousand halos
Like torches in the night of the spirit, a thousand traps, pitfalls of brimstone
And the empty sky, prostrated face against the earth in frantic laughter...

I was beyond withstanding my own ignominy. I invoked it and blessed it.
I progressed ever further into vileness and degradation. Am i resurging,
Intact, out of infamy?"

Cosmogenesis,Obscura,anger,"For evermore the sphere of human thoughts
Reunites the abyss, god and light

In the crawling inner mourning flame,
A reed of thousands souls regret
To form an eternal wave
Meeting of the spirits

That manmade shell of human fragments
Dissected, skinned show a new truth
Existence wraps into cold dimension
Lifeless breath of old revelation.

Bound into a stillborn level, built with any light
Consciousness, to them describe all sin
Consumed by fire, ascending to the night

I'm happy you're so impulsive
Means that your passionate
I'm happy you're moving so fast
But will it ever last
I know you wanna break free
From this monotony
I'm happy you're coming with me
But by choice it's gotta be

We can spend some time together
What he has he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no repect
And I can see your getting it

So figure it out let's go

I'm happy you're changing your speed
Slow down and lay with me
On bottom but always discrete
Kneel down and kiss her feet
I'm happy your going too far
Full strength before we start
Sometimes you make it so hard
Scream loud as we come apart

We can spend some time together
What he had he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no repect
And I can see your getting it
So figure it out let's go

We can spend some time together
What he has he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no repect
And I can see your getting it
So figure it out let's go
Figure it out let's go
Figure it out let's go
Figure it out let's
Go."
Out On Bail,2Pac,anger,"Oh, I posted bail?

Let these old punk ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit
Niggaz ain't going back to court you stank ass bitches

Im stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail if I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up

I ain't trippin' in the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause I'm rappin'
They askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson

I can't sleep they takin' polaroids
And I'm tryna to use the phone but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my glock cause it's major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastics in razors

These motherfuckers won't leave me alone that's my word
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo' pictures and make me some more riches

To all the suckers on the block talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep and the fame is brief
And you bullshittin' bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutta I was saved from hell
I'm a thug I was raised in jail

Thuglife niggaz (Hey, pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex)
Thuglife niggaz (Yes bitch that's a President)

Stuck in jail and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild thru the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds

I got no love in my heart cause I'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark wanna start shit
Rippin' up the scene as a teen I was at it (but hey)
And sellin' products to the addicts cause they gotta have it

I was a well-known thug and I gotta lotta love
Hangin out with the OG's shootin' up the clubs
And mama told me don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me then it's on G

Got me sittin' in the cell a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven
Got my bitches on the outside writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me and the shit you'll get better
I don't believe her cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your bitch is on fire

I gotta be a player so I stay strong
Cause I know that I won't be away long
And when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous
I'm on bail

Unfulfilled,Quicksand,anger,"To stand the test of time,
To stand alone.
To be without the glue,
That keeps us glued together.

And feeling so excrementable.
It only goes to show you,
How many ways you don't know you.
When the bad sets in,

I could use some sleep.
Resting, falling,
Falling deeper than deep.
We miss the point to carry on,

We miss the point.
To carry on where.
Things you love but did not get.
And all the times you've been upset by,

Unfulfilled dreams and visions,
And the guilt for your wrong decisions.
It's so hard to pry away.
Pry out from under all the lies,

And distractions of the world,
You've seen what they can do,
But you can't see your way out.
We miss the point to carry on.

All thing fall through.
That how it feels, when you hear the sound of Disappointment.
So unsatisfied,
When the sight's set higher.

Some can't achieve, don't believe,
There is light at the end at all.
There's no light.
Time to reach out for what's real,

It's easy to miss, insist,
That you shouldn't always follow the first thing you feel."
Nothing Dreadful Ever Happens,Every Time I Die,anger,"Forget everything i'm about to say.

"Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck",Demon Hunter,anger,"Nothing breeds more contempt for this world
Than the memories now formed
Every moment a new seed
Is grown to no reason, the trouble unfolds
For the trials of today
I'm no jury, really don't care how you feel
The pleasant notion of miraculous change
Drifts into multiple jeers

Jeers
Jeers

You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers
You snap your neck

Suckers drip through my hands
Washed of moments unborn
All the spaces between bleed
A tribute to a sacrament never exposed
A message to the forces
I have no pity, don't know how thankful to feel
Expectations of my daily bread
Gives me the hunger to steal

You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers
You snap your neck

You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers
You snap your neck

You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers
You snap your neck

You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers

2nd Hand Smoke,Twiztid,anger,"Free your mind
I represent the East side, no peace
Fuck the police
We tell you to increase the deceased at least
A grown man tellin you something that he believe
Practice to deceive, no more tricks up my sleeve
What the fuck bitch, chuck bitch
Why you talkin shit?
Better duck bitch.
Before your dome get hit.
This shit is Twiztid deeper than that Old French braid.
Stickier than jam and jelly phased, kick it
Everybody else real talkin bout something.
What you thought you heard bitch,
Can it, cause your frontin.
Dead wrong.
Dinner table conversations.
Leavin' you pistol-whipped in the corner with abrasions.
Part of the contamination of Mind State.
Sleep in a dream, hopin it's gone when I awake.
Mama think I'm a play on play serial killa
Fruitloop biting my mind like Godzilla
We survive like catipillas in cocoons and caskets
Stretch the industry like elastic
So fantastic, like the Newport cigarette that I smoke.
Hit the motherfucka till I choke
I brag and I boast about nothin
Death, dying, and hoes fuckin
So understand that he's saying something.
Never be heard I'm underground with the dirt and grime
Smashin heads be my reason for rhyme
I'm on time like a motherfucka
Leavin you hangin in the forest
Standin in some comfortable shifts like Chuck Norris
Check the chorus
Second hand smoke when you breath.
Remember what I told you always believe.
You relieve on the Monoxide Child and wild.
Travel the world on nine cloud screaming loud.
Free your mind
Breath it in second hand smoke
Free your mind
Breath it in second hand smoke
You phony bitches wanna shut me down
Pullin plugs on the microphones.
Hatin on the individual handle Mr.Bones
Hope your speaker's ain't ohms or they dead blown
If they aren't turn this motherfucka up and mash on
As we blast off bitch ass niggas at fast rates
Growin at a fast pace made my heart race.
Lookin death in the face and I don't even shudder.
If my woman starts cheatin motherfuck her, bitch
I'm out my cell
Seen weed, fame and wealth
So take your hopes and dreams,
And put that shit back on the shelf
Cause we rollin in a ride far from stolen
Cigarette lighters, power windows, wood grade motors and
Takin curbs with ease, blowin trees, lookin Chinese
Hopin that the cops ain't tailin me.
Tryin to violate the glass house
Nigga pass the blunt before you pass out
Cause now it's on, pushin hubcaps
Patrollin the hood, so fuck that.
Heard the shit and the shit is all wack
Plannin the attack, cause we move when it's dark at night
Believe the rumors, cause they probably all right.
Outta sight like concealed weapons and drug trades
Barricading your door for the raid
And in the shade is a sawed off double-barreled pump
Lookin for mothafuckas who wanna jump.
Cause I got 13 bullets in my pocket I'm a mad man
My trigger finger turnin suckers to sand
Free your mind
Breath it in second hand smoke
Free your mind
Breath it in second hand smoke
Distraught from head trauma
You can't even see the drama
I get the persona from marijuana
At night I lay stressed with no place to go
All by my lonely screamin out fuck that show
Cigarettes, blunt smoke I love the smell
Player hate me cause I smoke, burn in hell
Cause it ain't for everybody
I live to sever bodies so melancholy
Suicide is just a folly and I'm out
Free your mind
Breath it in second hand smoke (what, what)
Free your mind
Breath it in second hand smoke
Free your mind
Breath it in second hand smoke (what)
Free your mind
Breath it in second hand smoke

The Next Time I Go,Sinking Ships,anger,"been staying up way too late again. trying to sort it out. tracing all the lines back to origins. been keeping track of of everything. and eive been keeping track again. and everything seems to glaring to me. so tonight im stepping outside for what feels like the thousandth time. walking with hands in my pockets, looking down the same old streets. this place can become a part of you, whether or not you want it to. and everyone i know is keeping to themselves and everyone i know is trying really hard to grow and to change. and im not keeping up.
so tonight im stepping outside wishing that it could be the last time. ill stare at these same old streets, wet pacement under me and you never notice the days getting shorter. you never notice how it all can change. but it does becasue in the mirror sheen of these slick streets, there i can see a face looking up at me.
i know its the features. i know its a shape. weathered lines trace a story of change, not of being left behind, not a trace of flitter or shine, this is just me. and with this foe i have a love hate past. how come you win every race. fine ill relish what i have today, and then tomorrow ill do the same. the next time, memory crutch staying home. next time i go..."

Don't want to stay and drown
The drama got too thick
Makes me sick
And I don't wanna talk about it
I already thought about it
Stripped down of my pride
I shed the tears then dried these eyes
Well it was fun at the start
But maybe we're world's apart
Facing different ways
Different plains
And I don't wanna drag it out and
I just got to get on out and
Leave it all behind
It's time so don't deny it
Well I wanna know... does it show on my face
I'm sick of this place
I wanna move on, cause the feeling is gone
I wanna see... is it me out the door
I told you before
I wanna have fun, and it's just begun yeah
I've seen the light
Tried to talk about it
If you were ever down for me
Just stop... and you'd see
You know I'm right
And it showed in your eyes
What we had shared had run empty
So let... it be
Let it be
I wanna know... does it show on my face
I'm sick of this place
I wanna move on... now there's one of us gone yeah

Back In The Mud,Bubba Sparxxx,anger,"1, 2
1, 2, 3, Let's go

Back in the mud I've been in
I confess, I'm so happy here
There's nothing you can do to make me stay away, away, away

He's just that country boy, city slick, pit bull temperament
At the Pony, at the Flame, either way it's an event
If it's me consider it more than a coincidence
Even though they mumble at me sucka's keep they distances
Barber K, hey, what's that, they say
Hip hop redneck that's a safe place
Say what makes you comfortable
Wit me 'cause I like it here
How about a road-dwellin' urban music pioneer
Turn it up, let it bang, run wit me I bet you can't
Took too much to make it float, never will I let it sink
So when we invented it for our youth and generous
Hopin' that my moment passed, I can see no end of it
Twenty-five, livin' like I was born yesterday
Lovin' life, doin' right, earnin' every breath I take
Standin' in the mud again 'cause it seem to pay me well
Playin' wit my not-so-distant cousins from the A-T-L
Aaah

Back in the mud I've been in
I confess, I'm so happy here
There's nothing you can do to make me stay away, away, away

Press it up, ship it out, call the Pony, rent it out
Everything I am today is really what I been about
Athens, Gerogia resident, native of LaGrange though
I don't love the peach state, ""Buddy, say it ain't so""
Now all of a sudden, in fact, it's quite the opposite
I'm lovin' y'all from Brunswick up to the metropolis
Can't forget about my Betty Betty and DaLonica
They put the triple X's at the end of Andy's moniker
How could I run from everything that made me
Know that all the love I get's appreciated greatly
Now I'm on the brink of something truly inconceivable
Bubba's international but still he kept it regional
Tryin' to make my mama proud
We can laugh and see the smile
Gotta make sure loaded gun, this next CD is in your file
Each and everyone of my talented associates get's what they deserve
Nothin' short of that's appropriate

Back in the mud I've been in
I confess, I'm so happy here
There's nothing you can do to make me stay away, away, away

Kitchen cup, fill it up, soap don't appeal to us
If you're broke do what you can, that alone is still enough
Help us out, if you're rich, 'cause we funna hit your bitch
Just stop by the store and grab a case of that and six of this
Hey Betty, get ready 'cause your daddy's in route
Let her join the beat club, keep that little trim out
Hvae her screamin' ""New South"" without pullin' ""lewd"" out
He always wonder what you doing, let him wonder who now
At the end of the day I would have no regrets
Got it done on every front and I ain't even focused yet
At the bottom of the pile swimmin' wit them mud cats
If you die, man I'm pullin' ""soowee"" for a grudge match
Spell it out, L-E-G, E-N-D I still believe
Whatever goal God set for me indeed I will achieve
In this life or in the next, whther drinkin' gin or Beck's
Bubba funna bring it home, conceal it, and send the checks

Back in the mud I've been in
I confess, I'm so happy here
There's nothing you can do to make me stay away, away, away

Back in the mud I've been in

Brother,Gil Scott-Heron,anger,"There are a lot of comments about, um
Who's blacker than you are, and who's blacker than she is, blacker than thou
In other words, it's a sort of trend
And, in looking on various street corners in Harlem, I'm sure you seen it yourself
Standing on a soapbox on the corner, is an alleged brother
Dressed in blue and black dashikis or green, red and black dashikis
And spouting the news that the revolution is coming and you'd better get ready
Sorta-like the end of the world is coming
I saw recent commercials that said
""Unfortunately, the world is just going to drag on and on""
And we have a poem that we've written particularly for the brothers on the street corners
And it's called just that, ""Brother""

We deal in too many externals, brother
Always afros, handshakes, and dashikis

Never can a man build a working structure for black capitalism
Always does the man read Mao or Fanon

I think I know you would-be black revolutionaries too well
Standing on a box on a corner, talking about blowing the white boy away
That's not where it's at, yet, brother

Calling this man an Uncle Tom
And telling this woman to get an afro
But you won't speak to her if she looks like hell, now will you brother?

Some of us been checking you act out kinda close
And by now it's looking kinda shaky, the way you been rushing people with your super-black bag
Jumping down on some black men with both feet because they are after their B.A
But you're never around when your B.A. is in danger
I mean your black ass

I think it was a little too easy for you to forget that you were a negro before Malcolm
You drove your white girl through the village every Friday night
While the grass roots stared in envy and drank wine
Do you remember?

You need get your memory banks organized, brother
Show that man you call an Uncle Tom just where he is wrong
Show that woman that you are a sincere black man

All we need to do is see you shut up and be black
Help that woman
Help that man
That's what brothers are for, brother"

(I woke up in a dream today) To the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
(Forgot all about yesterday)
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
(A little taste of hypocrisy)
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
(Even though you're so close to me)
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I'm with you (you, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you (you, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you (you, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you (you, now I see, even when I close my eyes)

(I hit you and you hit me back)
Then we fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
(Fine line between this and that)
Go when things go wrong, I pretend that the past isn't real
(Now I'm trapped in this memory)
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
(Even though you're close to me)
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

While I'm holding the weight of the world on my conscience
(No) I won't just sit here and wait
While you weighing your options, you're making a fool of me
(No) You didn't dare to try to say that you don't care

I will descent
Until I reach the end

Within a bite
Brings darkness to your light
Help me to say the promised word good-bye
Don't wake me from this dream

Close your eyes
The order to die

You recognize
Close your eyes
The order to die

44 Magnum Opus,Exodus,anger,"Can't withhold my anger won't control my rage
My bloodlust will be sated
I'm locked and loaded and ready to engage
Killing everything I've always hated
A motherfucking Van Gogh with a gun
About to paint his masterpiece
Blow the world into oblivion
Paint with the blood of the deceased
Fire away
Put your body on display
Build myself a tower of decay
A symphony
Written in human debris
Art and murder true synonymy
No appeal, no ""I got a raw deal"", I don't give a fuck
One thing is clear, I've got a deaf ear
[Pre-Chorus]
You better shut your mouth and duck
When I get a taste of laying everyone to waste
My hunger won't subside
I won't ever stop till the last body drops
Let the bullet be my guide
[Chorus]
The virtue of vice
In my bloody paradise
A portrait of gore
My .44
Magnum
My .44 magnum opus
Bodies are the canvas, ammo is the vision
For my greatest work of art
I'm waging my own inquisition
Tearing everything apart
I'm building a monument to horror
A temple so divine
Remembrance to those I've massacred
Death the grand design
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
People will stare in disbelief and awe
When they see what I've created
Still life, no life beautiful and raw
The world will be captivated
Never have they seen something so ambitious
Like nothing done before
A work so terrible and vicious
A masterpiece of gore
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]"
Our Endless War,Whitechapel,anger,"Let's go
America our wasteland
Where death is entertainment
The place where moving forward means you turn the other direction
A place where reality existed
And we still continue to bleed
Red, White, Blue for ourselves and who?
And they still hold the truth so we say
Fuck you!
My country disagreed, sweet land of idiocracy
This is our endless war!
While we still have liberty
Lets take back our justice for all
We can march at sundown upon capitol hill
We're calling you out
Come face us now and see your true war
Let's take it back
We the people have spoken against
Our endless war!
There is nothing left to prove
We've spoke our minds risked our lives
Make your move
Tread lightly, choose your words wisely
Or we will refuse to bleed
Red, White, Blue for ourselves and who?
And they still hold the truth so we say
Fuck you!
My country disagreed, sweet land of idiocracy
While we still have liberty, all justice for all
Shut it down!
50 states united as one
But we still cant find a solution
Where have we gone
It seems that our motto to live by
When your chin deep in shit
don't, breathe and die!
don't, breathe and die!
Let's take back our justice for all!
We can march at sundown upon capitol hill
We're calling you out
Come face us now and see your true war
We can march at sundown upon capitol hill
We're calling you out
Come face us now and see your true war
I've said before and I'll say it again
This world is ours
Let's take it back and give them their war
Let's take it back!

Have spoken against
Our endless war!

I guess I'm heading for regrets

No longer are the same, no!

Apocalyptic Havoc,Goatwhore,anger,"Apocalyptic Havoc

Watch the skies as hell comes riding in
On a horse of pale to name this wrath
Torturing worthless souls as this reign begins
This hand of doom is set to rule the world.

A wilted faith in these times of regret
Sculpting death in madness obsessed.

Words of this mayhem cast out loud
A timeless torture foretold in a sky of black
Torn souls from the mold of flesh and bone
Hordes of plague in this path of all decay.

Obliterate the screams of the weak
Who needs a god when you've got Satan
No god to offer this forgiveness
No god to punish for these sins
Tormented for the prize of salvation
Broken loyalty to life after death.

These dark thoughts of this revival
Answered by the prayers of this carnage
Confusion caused in the spread of horror
The answer to your nightmares has just begun.

Forgotten praise of a savior from the rapture beyond the clouds
A burning fear of the wrongs that the slave has chosen.

Cleansed in flame, purified through ash
These burning rites of the vengeful
The head of three faces, severed in confession
Ritual abuse to swarm the insects of famine.

Endless weight of sufferance closing the source of breath
Battle call for the rise of genocide for the righteous believers
Unholy force to be summoned by the screams of slaughter
The wicked tongue of plague calling forth the death of god."

What U See is What U Get
Intro: Xzibit, (J-Ro)

Speaking:
And so it was written, and after all these things,
I saw another angel come down from heaven
Having great power and the eath was lighted with his glory
And he cried mightily with the strong voice saying ""Babylon the great has
Fallen,
It's fallen and has become the habitation of devils
And the home to every fowl spirit and a cage of very unclean and hateful men""

What you see is what you get now
Xzibit never wait around for kick downs, get my own shit, blowe
Shot heard around the world
Uplift, bench press, arm curl, keep the structure of the temple
To make things simple my existance is to ripple through time
Only concern is what is mine, divine, never monkey shine
Walkin' down the very thin line, holdin' wait, runnin' crazy in the streets,
Yeah
Plus the company I keep work in overtime
While you oversleep don't wanna see none of this evil I speak
Around on the atlas, cume la matra, the super actress
You all get close-lined and pinned the mattress
All day, every day, every which way
Who said to can't have your cake and eat it too(fuck you)
This is a hard time on planet earth
For what it's worth Xzibit stand station without reabilitation like this

Gangstas, macks everyday, all day, shot callers, even high rollers keep it

And like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright

Who's The Man,House of Pain,anger,"I used to kick it with the thugs, pushin' drugs in the park
Makin' every mark that was out after dark
Stick 'em for their loot, cut em up then I'd dash
And when I had to shoot, I'd nutted up for the cash
Ran down the block with my 45 glock
Capped off a round, everybody hit the ground
The next thing I heard was a siren
Couldn't turn around, money grip kept firin'
Runnin' for the ride, I can't go inside
I'd rather that I died, I got too much pride
I guess it's just somethin' that you can't understand
My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man?
Chorus (x4)
Who's the man with the master plan?
Who's the man? Who's the man?
I used to sell yayo back in the day-o
Ran with the gang, had all the homie's slang
Grams to the quarters, I'm takin' all the orders
Makin' all the runs, Rakin' in the funds
I always got my gun, it's the old six-shooter
King of the neighborhood, crazy white peckerwood
Now people thinkin' Danny lost his mind
It must've been from all the wine man and all the hardtimes
Like chillin' in the park in the dark with the crew
I'm always gettin' high, I saw my man die
Now I got the work and the dough, 25 grand and a 5 keys of blow
I gotta' relocate and start all over
But watch it blow up like a supernova
I keep my game in tight and follow the plan
My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man?
Chorus (x4)
I got myself locked down in the pen
I ain't got a friend, so here I go again
I gotta' get my props up and earn my respect
Gotta' shake someone up or throw 'em off the top deck
My time's runnin' out, I gotta' spill some blood
If I don't do it quick, shit, my name'll be mud
So I pick out a hardrock and rush him in his cell
Beat his ass down and then say that he fell
And if I gotta' do him, scrw him, the convict's dead
I'll stab him in the chest just to let the rest
Of the cell block know that I'm nobody's ho
My shanks in my hand so tell me who's the man?

Can I Run,L7,anger,"Are these sensible shoes on my feet
I wear my shades so our eyes don't meet
I'm scared every fuckin' day
I wear my headphones so i can't hear what you say

Can i run

Switch to paranoid from having fun
Will he use his hands, knife, or a gun
Knuckles are white, wrapped around my mace
Comes from living in a terrorist state

Can i run

When he's following me
He's not my brother, he's my enemy
Is he behind the door or in back of the tree
Is he under the bed, is he in the back street

Can i run"
If Your Gonna,Natasha Bedingfield,anger,"Got a short attention plan
Can't sit around couch potato land
I wanna do all kinds of stuff
Talking about it's not enough
I wanna go to the extreme
I wanna stretch my limousine
I wanna take it way off road
Go where I'm not supposed to go

Life is music, play it louder

If you're gonna jump, then jump far, fly like a sky diver
If you're gonna be a singer, then u better be a rockstar
If you're gonna be a driver, then u better drive a race car
Cause I'm looking for a guard dog, not buying a chihuahua

I like my food with chili in
I like to laugh til it turns in
I wanna stare fear in the face
I wanna take it all the way

Life is music play it louder

If you're gonna jump, then jump far, fly like a sky diver
If you're gonna be a singer, then u better be a rockstar
If you're gonna be a driver, then u better drive a race car
Cause I'm looking for a guard dog, not buying a chihuahua

If you're gonna jump, then jump far,
If you're gonna
If you're gonna hit the high notes, you gotta be a diva
If you're gonna play a guitar, you gotta play til you blister
Cause I'm looking for a guard dog not buying a chihuahua

No happy apples for my tea
It's hot or cold no in between

If your gonna jump
If your gonna jump
If your gonna jump

If you're gonna jump, then jump far, fly like a sky diver

Preacher Crawling,Pig Destroyer,anger,"I dream sometimes of a brother in red.
The first unborn.
Perhaps the son of god aborted
And tossed and a garbage bag.
Life is black comedy.
Slapstick and vulgarity.
Unworthy of the name.
I still remember where mine went so wrong.
My last night in sodom and my first morning in hell."
Can't Stop,Suicidal Tendencies,anger,"There's a place I try to go, so far from here
I close my eyes, I try to, to disappear
I look around in my own way
But what I see I never, never really know

I wander 'round until I feel it coming on
And then it's, it's time to go
I don't want to be here falling out of place
Confusion's the consensus, fighting for my space

And then you make me open my eyes and come back
All I wanted was some time, some time to think, that's all I needed
I would have been okay with just a little time
My time not your time, you never have time

I want to know I tried
You're probably here right now waiting
Waiting for that moment to ambush me
Swallow my hopes, crush my confidence
Pull me down, pull me down lower than you ever have before

Just see if you grab my heart and rip it out
And then you chew on and spit it out
Throw it over the ground and stomp all over it
Laughing, laughing hysterically, tellin' me to do something

Knowing that I won't, knowing that I can't
Knowing that you're me and I'm you
And I can never hate you as much as you hate me
Knowing the weaker I get, the stronger you are
Knowing how weak I am, knowing how strong you are

Can't stop the running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me

I lived it, I live it, it's not easy to say
I felt it, I feel it, it's just another day
It scares me, why does it dare me?
You know it ain't a fair fight
Rain overtakes me, it tries to break me
You know that something ain't right

Now you got 'em running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got 'em running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me, set my body free

They don't make no seatbelt for the mind
So I can't fasten up for this ride

Running away, can't stop the runaway emotions
Not right, can't fight, can't stop the runaway emotions
Fighting, hiding, can't stop the runaway emotions
Hypnotized, paralyzed, can't stop the runaway emotions

I was scared, I am scared
I know that but I'm not afraid doing at it
She being scared that don't bother me
It's just a feeling, I can do with that

I know what it is, that's what I don't know
What I can't feel that's what bothers me
That's what really scares me
See right now I'm scared, really scared
'Cause I can feel it, emotionally paralyzed, light headed

Like you know when you got a pass out, actually I wish I would
You know kind of like when you gotta sneeze, the relief it brings
Just waiting, waiting for something to happen
Waiting for that moment to renew a [Incomprehensible]
See the moment takes you nowhere

Know what's realm, right now, no one's with you, right?
Know what, it's what you bring to me
Know it's like an itch that I can't scratch, like an itch in the brain
Knowing your body figure out a way to scratch it, just itches more

Can't stop the running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me

I hate it, I hate me, like my consistency
I've seen it, I see it, I'm talking literally
So much lying, too much denying
It's time to face the facts
You can't help me, these cards will deal me
They are the final acts

Now you got 'em running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got 'em running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me, set my body free

Oh no, you really done it this time

Can't stop the runaway emotions
Can't stop the runaway emotions
Can't stop the runaway emotions
Can't stop the runaway emotions

There's a place I try to go, so far from here
I close my eyes but I can't, can't disappear"
Last Man Standing,People In Planes,anger,"I'll be the last man home
I am the last man stand survivor
I'll be the last man home
You're all alone sitting in the corner
You've got a killer stare
Who's messing round with you in the corner?
He better say his prayers

Baby, it's a jungle out

You'll never grow up to be a big-rock-star-celebrated-victim-of-your-fame

Cheap coupons and say that death

Just closed you eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your mind

But I'm not a slave to a god
That doesn't exist (fight, fight)

No matter what has happened, Please remember the good times.
And no matter what you've said or done learn to watch your fucking mouth.
Unless your caught on video on video and you're ankle deep in it.
We can make things go away for the right pay check.
Fallow the smell to the man behind the glass.

I'll steal the wind from your sails and I'll make sure you die.
Going to be a witch hunt."
Nostalgic Pushead,Manic Street Preachers,anger,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

Now a knife constantly slashing eyelids

Slavery to the God

Slavery to the beat
Slavery to the chord
Slavery to the pleasure
Slavery to the God

They dig the new scene and their parties
Where Stonehenge is worshiped and drugs a deity
Vicarious thrills rerun their youth
We follow, we have no voice, the dead

Radio nostalgia is radio death
I wanna cover diamonds on my wife
Hard rock nostalgia, The Stones on CD
Tranquilized icons for the sweet paralyzed

Slavery to the beat

Slavery to the pleasure
Slavery to the God

Slavery to the beat
Slavery to the chord
Slavery to the pleasure
Slavery to the God

So cool, the new sound of the decade
Think it's so fresh, not a post Elvis still
All taste is nothing, old pictures blow dried
Rebellion, it always sells at a profit

I am a face of fashion in Soho Square
My tie is Paul Smith or Gaultier
My cheeks blood red as my favorite port
But hey, cocaine keeps cholesterol at bay

The Entrance to the Spheres of Mars,Behemoth,anger,"Freedom - said I
And then the sun set and the dusk
Fell on my life
Transformations and metamorphoses
It was what I experienced there, on the south of heaven
I was striking with my fists at the heavens ceilings
Too low I fell, I did not reach the step-father's neck
Although his visage seemed so close
With bony fingers I desired to clench the crown of thorns
In vain, I have trampled the paradisical flower of love
And I trample its rights here, on the earth
Each sin - my soldier
A daemon of the several thousand strong cavalery
Not gods son I am, but the child of million stars
While each of them symbolises different human fraility greater than mine
I am the wisdom and the perfection of the universe."

Perfect death in a colourfull tv screen

Hatred Aside,Sepultura,anger,"Explode in disorder, no matter the prize
Steps on the path, the righteous do find
Try as they will but they cannot divide

Time is relentless, pushing us on
Restoring our fate, we never lost sight
Spirits evolving, flowing as one
Having no limits, all hatred aside
Try as they will but they cannot divide

To divide, to divide, to divide
To divide, to divide, to divide
To divide, to divide, to divide

Live for the sound loud to survive
My will has no bounds to keep this alive
Truth pave the way to the world that I know
Love for our brothers we'll not fail to show

Learn what we hear, see what we feel
The air that I breathe could not be more real
Spit out bitter pill that made me want to hide
Try as they will but they cannot divide

Cannot divide
Cannot divide
Cannot divide
No!

Time is your enemy only if you let it be
I won't let my future get away from me
Listen, let go, out of my mind
Out of my mind, listen, let go

Need to reach, seek to find
Will not breach, cannot divide"
Giveth,The Chariot,anger,"Settle down, we ain't alone anymore, we ain't afraid.
We cannot be alone anymore. Pardon all the mess but the offer fits.
As we shake and as we sing along, the harmony is not me alone anymore.
My only regret is nothing. If only those were my steps
Keep them in their placement. This alone shall be the death of me.
This is everything they all wanted. Figure out your confidence.
But the tango begs for a partnership. So make it a romance.
All in all we stay face against it. Does this mean I'm a threat?
Well am I a threat or am I success?"
Stop At Nothing,Dying Fetus,anger,"Compelled to eternal hate, censure of the mob, submit to them
Pressured from the outside, prevailing herd mentality, fearing deviation
Traumatized, retreat and submit, habitual failure, they no longer attempt
Resist all efforts at change, practice the routine

Fake courage to impress the other sheep
All cowards in their own pointless, twisted fate

Constant friction, voicings of new converts, don't know shit
Arbitrary changes visit ownership upon me

Do I look like I need you to rearrange my realm?
Drift through the motions of your predetermined course
Escape the dreary confines of your present circle
Solve your internal conflict, mend your own life

Follow useless trends, fucking with my mind, indignant lies that I reject
I care less and less for your weak opinion, pretension, pomposity
Reinforce your fear, admonishment of fools, path of least resistance
Bottomless mass of simpletons

Uncover your own future, ignore the losers words
Endure the pessimism, projections of the timid
Escape the dreary confines of your present circle
Solve your infernal conflict, before your demise

Reinforce your fear, admonishment of fools, path of least resistance
I care less and less for your weak opinion, pretension, pomposity
You're not qualified to deliver me, realize, drop your crusade
Nothing will prevent the ends I have chosen

Agonizing reapprisal, long ago I came unto my own
Discard the worthless bullshit, comprehend the revelations beyond
Hypocrites eating shit, choking on the spewings they never lived by
Estimations of lesser men, self-fulfilled to their dead ends"

Only to burn up both our hands
And we will find out what's to know...
In warning winds the truth will blow

You might find I'm feeling all the guilt
Dragging out the hours, all decieved
Both are harmless and haunting to me
Now remember your heroes
As a cancel out zero
Like you were young again

A man you haven't seen in years
Ressurecting your deepest fears
Returns a favor unto himself...
By turning us the other cheek

You're just a coat of red in hell.
Tired of turning us away

You might find I'm feeling all the guilt
And now remember your heroes
As a cancel out zero
You were never the one to break away

Dragging out the hours, all deceived
And now remember your heroes
As a cancel out zero
You were never the one to break free

You turn your eyes to gray
You turn your eyes away
You

You're another coat of red in hell.
Kill this child to made sure I've raised him well.

On a concrete road to recovery
Cause I'm knocking over every cone
In front of me."
Dog,Sebastian,anger,"When I was a boy I was confounded by you
Now I'm still a boy I am indebted to you
Every song I ever wrote was written for you
Written for you

Now I'm feeling flat you seem mile away
I'm so tired that down on the pavement I'll lay
Till the blossom on the tree comes falling on me
Fall on me

From my window I can see the mountains in snow
From my window I will shut my eyes and let go
Promise me you'll always be around when I call
And when I fall

On the river bridge up on the wall, looking down
On the river bridge, to me a vision was shown
If I could hold on to things till I was full grown
Peace would I know

To my dog on wheels I'll tell my pleasures and woes
To my dog on wheels I'll tell my secrets and more
Then one day in spring I'll take him down to the road
Anything goes"

They all want to fuck their mothers
He comes in my bedroom around corners
Of moonlight;
Unexpected, he catches me
In his big arms an ancient music at the edge
Of my mouth
He looks at me
And warns:

The second you touched it it started to die inside
When you said ""show me your tits"" we were
Wishing you died
Extending into flesh and staring
This fake revolution resolved into PACK OF

The weak and the old dying of frostbite
Through piercing wind and icy snow
Keep pushing north to our prison home

Death march! Death march! Death march! Death march!

No walls, no fence keep us inside
Held captive by the snow and the ice
Surrender your hope, succumb to your fear
No one escapes, we will all die here

Death march! Death march! Death march! Death march!

Through mountains high, and valleys low
Through desert heat, and arctic snow
Six of us run with no chance to survive
Rather to die free, than a slave alive"

No doubt, yeah, I'm a veteran
And when done you gon' think you got ran over by elephants
Since I came ain't been the same like ever since
And that talking, yeah, it better end.

(CHORUS)

This is: My world, my way, my life
And if I gotta do it I gotta do it right
So everything I want, go ahead and gimme that
If ya girl with me just know that you ain't gettin back
Yeah, she want a bad boy
And I'm all about my cash boy
You see me all up in the Jag boy
I know that make you mad boy
But don't make me beat ya ass boy
So don't go there
Ya career's like a treadmill: you runnin' but you ain't goin' nowhere
Me, on the other hand
I can blow 100 stacks and bounce back rubberband
30 karats here, 100 on the other hand
I do me, I don't worry 'bout another man
I'm way past'em, got'em playin' catch up
I'll be right there if you ever mess up

Tick-tock, but the day don't have no memory"
Lovedivided,Diablo,anger,"I can remember the times
When the grace was
Shining on my face
Don't you see, don't you feel
Those days are gone
They've vanished in the air.
Now I could not care less
Of you and your poisoned mind
Cos I have already seen
This thousand times

My emotions are hidden
In a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
That we once shared
On these frontlines,
Frontlines of mysteries!

Hell yeah!

I can remember the love
At some point it became
One with my hate
And I can see how
You are wasting your life,
Wasting your dignity
The light in my eyes is fading away
But I bleed no tears
Cos I know your destiny

My emotions are hidden
In a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
That we once shared
On these frontlines,
Frontlines of mysteries!

How blind can you be?
Don't you know what I mean?

Love divided, love divided
Extending agony!
Love divided, love divided

I hate your empty words
And the grin on your face, ah!

My emotions are hidden
In a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams

Symphony of Tourette,Manic Street Preachers,anger,"""Stutter, stutter"", says the little boy
I wanna blow a hole in my head
I swear what this world wants to hear
Trapped in what we know as truth syndrome
Stutter, stutter, silence, no friend

""Children can be cruel"", she said
So I smashed her in the fucking head
Sorry dear, that's the nature of Tourette

Stutter, stutter nothing else but me
I twitch and turn while underneath
My contemporaries are so in control
""Fuck you, fuck you"", I grunt and groan
Stutter, stutter, can't keep it no more

""Children can be cruel"", she said
So I smashed her in the fucking head
Sorry dear, that's the nature of Tourette

Yeah!
Drop it!
Bones in the water and dust in my lungs
Absorbing archaic like a sponge
The ultimate way is the way you control
But you can stay if you detach your soul
Bury the present and squeeze out the past
The ones you endear to never last
Chemical burns and the animalistic
I'm just another harline psuedo-statistic
Can you feel this?
I'm dying to feel this
Can you feel this?
Blood on the paper and skin on my teeth
Trying to commit to what's beneath
To find the time is to lose the momentum
You learn the lessons and immediately forget them
Automatic and out of my reach
Consult all the waste to find the key
Minimal life and the polysyllabic
I'm just another blank page, push the button, pull the rage
Can you feel this?
I'm dying to feel this
Can you feel this?
I am all, but what am I?
Another number that isn't equal to any of you
I control, but I comply
Pick me apart, then pick up the pieces
I'm uneven
I am the damaged one
All my life and the damage done

Keyed up like Jim Hellwig

I'm like a mix of Zartan

Intro,Kid Rock,anger,"[Our lesson begins in the small town of Romeo, Michigan... 1985.]

Several years ago
Deep on the West side of Detroit
I rank souly with old and new school rules of hip hop
Don Balaw, Wes Chill and my DJ JC fresh
Rockin' microphones and turn tables day by day, and night by night
But still the force was not complete
That's when we met our homeboy by the name of Kid Rock
Others had doubts of the lad because he was white
But i knew what time it was
So i put him behind the tables and this is all he had to say

[Scratching] FUCK OFF!

[This... is the History Of Rock.]"
Indifferent,Beatsteaks,anger,"I see an old man on the street,
Without shoes and nothing to eat.
I ask myself, can this happen to me,
Whose's the one, who cares about these threat?
What a fuck is going on?
Ignorance and ""take it gone""!
Sorrow is a normal thing,
Silence about suffering.
Sad but true, we're still looking around,
We can't help, cause we're indefferent!
Is it the fear, that happens the same to us,
To make us blind
A little girl is walking next me,
I see her little swollen face.
I think she's taling to her mother and I hear:
""Daddy is angry in these days""
What the fuck is going on?
Ignorance and ""take it gone""!
Sorrow is a normal thing,
Silence about suffering.
Sad but true, we're still looking around,
We can't help, cause we're indifferent!
Is it the fear, that happens the same to us,
To make us blind.
We close our eyes and it happens everyday."
Spun,Babes in Toyland,anger,"I live inside
All invited inside

When you're spun like a kite
Sugar and tea and cream
Looks like the sea is green with rivalry

Now that I know just what you're all about
I want out
Now that I know just what you're all about
I want out

I live inside
All invited inside
Sugar and tea and cream
Looks like the sea is green with reverie

Now that I know just what you're all about

Well, I wanna see you standing next to me
Seems you've got nothing much to say
And when you're dying lying next to me
I'll turn my head and walk away

Sometimes it seems I might be losing touch
Or maybe I just try too much
Now I get told I'm crazy
Nothing you can say will faze me now

I wanna see you standing next to me
Seems you've got nothing much to say
And when you're dying lying next to me
I'll turn my head and walk away

Everything They Owe,2Pac,anger,"Imagine if we could go back
Actually talk to the mother fuckers that persevered
I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships
Excuse me, excuse me you know look

We back for everything you owe, no longer oppressed
'Cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin' what you thinkin'?
But you musta been the ship
'Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin'
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin' that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then ofcourse it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope, quotin' the reverand from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
This ain't bout talkin' bout problems, I bring solutions
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow

We comin' back for everythin' you owe

I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit a bad mentality

How do I plead? Yes sir, how do you plead?
Armed with missiles guns grenades

Shit, you know how I plead come on
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'
Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin' at my innocent family, say they lookin for kiss

I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Bust in, talkin' about, ""Where is the quaaludes?"" What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?

No feedback is what he uttered
Before he screamed nigga motherfucker
Dropped me to my knees I proceed to bleed
Sufferin' a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin'?
I grab his gat and bust in self defense, my only option, goddamn
Now they got me goin' to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
Move me, and my people, to a mansion in brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, reposessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin' this in federal prison, givin everything I owe
I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me

Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'

Crusher,The Haunted,anger,"If you can't hold your own,
Don't point your
Fucking finger at me!
Cough, spit, scream, HATRED,
All inclusive
And yes, it's a question of
Class and experience
Consider yourself dismissed.

Lesson A: This lifestyle is not
For sale.
Give it up, again, and again.
And that's how we do it!

To crush.
You must love.

No false pride
No fashion
No fake set of values
A primal force-to completely absorb.
Transforming, serpent-like.
Infernal and true.

Lesson B: Imitation equals failure
Surrender to this-
And that's how we do it!

To crush
You must love.

Character grows from pain-
Sealed and approved!
And the strength to overcome-
Trial by fire!
No slackness.
No wasted chase.
This is the discipline.

To crush you must love
The fine art of crush"
"If You Got It At Five, You Got It At Fifty",Norma Jean,anger,"Rock N Roll has such a terrible name, who is to blame?
Perching birds drug by a string in the air, stitched together with careless intention.
Cleaner than the dagger that hollowed it out.
Masked and forgotten or no face at all.
It's got something or nothing to say.
Yeah don't we all?
A trance and a trust fund stitched at the same time and sold to the hogs.
All eyes on you. Whatever it takes the bottom line is the only one that you'll cross.
Keep selling what they want to hear, arrogant and insincere.
You've got something to say, but what's the pay? A million before you and more in line.
I've seen it a thousand times.
Built to die and dying.
Built to last and lasting.
Go along to get along.
I will not be defiled by the kings' meat.
The noise ain't noise anymore, who's to blame?
You and I."
Down,Jawbreaker,anger,"This is the world, why are you waiting?
Everyone's standing by hesitating
So many people halfway there
Between two points in the middle of nowhere

And all those things you thought you'd be
Did you know that it doesn't come free?
Have you seen yourself of late?

Standing still beside the kill
Have you really got your fill?
Time to try for more than that

At times your feet they seem to slide
Never stop, never break your stride
And if you slip you can get up
That's the wonder of the winner's cup

Put your foot down into the shaky ground
Piss around a circle and make it sound
Look around, see the people lying down
Listen now, can't you hear the sound of...

Machines all breaking down, the fuel is running out
The severed lines destroyed by too much time spent down
My head forced down, my hope forced down
Between my legs, I come unwound

All my preaching stems from fear
You're my concern, I hold you dear
You must break out of this old cage
Do it now, this is no longer safe

And all those things you thought you'd be
Did you know that it doesn't come free?
Have you seen yourself of late?

Standing still beside the kill
Have you really got your fill?
Time to try for more than that"
The Remedy,Abandoned Pools,anger,"I could use
A shot of your novacaine

Blows away your name

Then you can be the remedy
And I can be the enemy
And we can go and live as nothing
Then you can be the wanna be
And I can be the remedy
And we can go to hell for all I care

Say this world is not so shallow
When you can't beg, steal, or borrow
Save your breath, your soul is hollow
And it's all too much to swallow

Take this souvenir
They can't deny you were here
This scar always there
To medicate your fear

Then you can be the remedy
And I can be the enemy
And we can go and live as nothing
Then you can be the wanna be
And I can be the remedy

A Better Son-Daughter,Rilo Kiley,anger,"Sometimes in the morning I am petrified and can't move
Awake but cannot open my eyes
And the weight is crushing down on my lungs
I know I can't breathe
And hope someone will save me this time
And your mother's still calling you insane and high
Swearing it's different this time
And you tell her to give in to the demons that possess her
And that god never blessed her insides
Then you hang up the phone and feel badly for upsetting things
And crawl back into bed to dream of a time
When your heart was open wide and you love things just because
Like the sick and dying
And sometimes when you're on
You're really fucking on
And your friends they sing along
And they love you
But the lows are so extreme
That the good seems fucking cheap
And it teases you for weeks in its absence
But you'll fight and you'll make it through
You'll fake it if you have to
And you'll show up for work with a smile
And you'll be better
You'll be smarter
More grown up and a better daughter or son
And a real good friend
And you'll be awake
You'll be alert
You'll be positive though it hurts
And you'll laugh and embrace all of your friends
And you'll be a real good listener
You'll be honest
You'll be brave
You'll be handsome and you'll be beautiful
You'll be happy
Your ship may be coming in
You're weak but not giving in
To the cries and the wails of the valley below
Your ship may be coming in
You're weak but not giving in
And you'll fight it you'll go out fighting all of them"

Now you're trying to find your underwear
And then your  t the door
And you're trying to find a reason
Why you have to leave
But i know it's 'cuz you think you're adam
And you think i'm eve

You rhapsodize about beauty
And my eyes glaze
Everything i love is ugly
I mean really, you would be amazed
Just do me a favor
It's the least that you can do
Just don't treat me like i am
Something that happened to you

I am, I am, I am 
truly sorry about all this

You put a tiny pin prick
In my big red balloon
And as i slowly start to exhale
That's when you leave the room
I did not design this game
I did not name the stakes
I just happen to like apples
And i am not afraid of snakes

I am, I am, I am 
truly sorry about all this
I envy you your ignorance
I hear that it's bliss, bliss, bliss

So i let go the ratio
Of things said to things heard
As i leave you to your garden
And the beauty you preferred
And i wonder what of this
Will have meaning for you
When you've left it all behind
I guess i'll even wonder
If you meant it
At the time

I Might Have Been Queen,Tina Turner,anger,"I'm a new pair of eyes
Every time I am born
An original mind
Because I just died

And I'm scanning the horizon for someone recognizing
That I might have been queen
For every sun that sets there is a new one dawning
For every empire crushed there is a brand new nation

Let the waters rise
I've ridden each tide
From the gates of the city
Where the first born died

And I might have been queen
I remember the girl in the fields with no name
She had a love
Oh, but the river won't stop for me
No, oh, the river won't stop for me

I'm a new pair of eyes
An original mind
With my senses of old
And the heart of a giant

And I'm searching through the wreckage
For some great recollection
That I might have been queen
For every sage that falls
There's an ancient child

And I might have been queen
I remember the girl in the fields with no name
She had a love
Oh, but the river won't stop for me
No, oh, the river won't stop for me

I look up to the stars with my perfect memory
I lived through it all, and my future's no shock to me
I look down, but I see no tragedy
I look up to the star till I find my destiny
I look up to my past, my spirit running free
I look down, I look down, and I'm there in history
Oh, I'm a soul survivor

Soul survivor on the river, but it won't stop
Soul survivor on the river
I might have been queen (but it won't stop)

But i'll prolly start driving and crash or some shit
Not on weed though, i control the buzz
And i can shake it quick when im hounded by the fuzz

I would just blow it in his face (*coughs* Hey what the fuck you doing?!?)

Where we all say ""fuck it"", and just get blunted

I just like to smoke till, I'm blitzed
And I stay away from people, who can't keep it lit
Hotboxed, and got the blunt all runnin'
And ya can't keep it goin' for nuthin'
Quit fuckin' around askin' anybody hear that sound

Im so glad I got my stash in the back
Eyelash stickin', Eyes all dry,
And my mouth feel like I been eatin' cotton pie
Still I wont stop smoking my pot,
Green grass is the shit that I'm lovin alot
Sit and wait on the block for the spot to get hot,
Then I go buy everything that they got
They only had a couple bags of that hot,
So I just said fuck it and grabbed a whole lot

So I gotta find something to cop. Here we goooo

'They' Schools,dead prez,anger,"Why haven't you learned anything?

Man that school shit is a joke
The same people who control the school system control
The prison system, and the whole social system
Ever since slavery, nawsayin?

I went to school with some redneck crackers
Right around the time 3rd bass dropped the cactus album
But i was readin malcolm
I changed my name in '89 cleaning parts of my brain
Like a baby nine
I took a history class serious
Front row, every day of the week, 3rd period
Fuckin with the teachers had, callin em racist
I tried to show them crackers some light, they couldn't face it
I got my diploma from a school called rickers
Full of, teenage mothers, and drug dealin niggas
In the hallways, the popo was always present
Searchin through niggas possessions
Lookin for, dope and weapons, get your lessons
That's why my moms kept stressin
I tried to pay attention but they classes wasn't interestin
They seemed to only glorify the europeans
Claimin africans were only three-fifths a human being

They schools can't teach us shit
My people need freedom, we tryin to get all we can get
All my high school teachers can suck my dick
Tellin me white man lies straight bullshit (echoes)
They schools aint teachin us, what we need to know to survive
(say what, say what)
They schools don't educate, all they teach the people is lies

You see dog, you see how quick these motherfuckers be to like
Be tellin niggas get a diploma so you can get a job
Knowwhatimsayin but they don't never tell you how the job
Gonna exploit you every time knowwhatimsayin that's why i be like
Fuck they schools!

School is like a 12 step brainwash camp
They make you think if you drop out you aint got a chance
To advance in life, they try to make you pull your pants up
Students fight the teachers and get took away in handcuffs
And if that wasn't enough, then they expel y'all
Your peoples understand it but to them, you a failure
Observation and participation, my favorite teachers
When they beat us in the head with them books, it don't reach us
Whether you breakdance or rock suede addidas
Or be in the bathroom with your clique, smokin reefer
Then you know they math class aint important 'less you addin up cash
In multiples, unemployment aint rewardin
They may as well teach us extortion
You either get paid or locked up, the pricipal is like a warden
In a four year sentence, mad niggas never finish
But that doesn't mean i couldn't be a doctor or a dentist

(first part of hook twice)

Cuz for real, a mind is a terrible thing to waste
And all y'all high class niggas with y'all nose up
Cuz we droppin this shit on this joint, fuck y'all
We gon speak for ourselves
Knowhatimsayin? cuz see the schools aint teachin us nothin
They aint teachin us nothin but how to be slaves and hardworkers
For white people to build up they shit
Make they businesses successful while it's exploitin us
Knowhatimsayin? and they aint teachin us nothin related to
Solvin our own problems, knowhatimsayin?
Aint teachin us how to get crack out the ghetto
They aint teachin us how to stop the police from murdering us
And brutalizing us, they aint teachin us how to get our rent paid
Knowhatimsayin? they aint teachin our families how to interact
Better with each other, knowhatimsayin? they just teachin us
How to build they shit up, knowhatimsayin? that's why my niggas
Got a problem with this shit, that's why niggas be droppin out that
Shit cuz it don't relate, you go to school the fuckin police
Searchin you you walkin in your shit like this a military compound
Knowhatimsayin? so school don't even relate to us
Until we have some shit where we control the fuckin school system
Where we reflect how we gon solve our own problems
Them niggas aint gon relate to school, shit that just how it is
Knowhatimsayin? and i love education, knowhatimsayin?
But if education aint elevatin me, then you knowhatimsayin it aint
Takin me where i need to go on some bullshit, then fuck education
Knowhatimsayin? at least they shit, matter of fact my nigga
This whole school system can suck my dick, beeyotch!!"

Finding Faith,Blacklisted,anger,"We find our faith in the damnedest place,
The thin line between love and hate,
Sold it all for a shot of hope,
So you can't feel but you can cope,
Although you know that it hurts,
They can't make it any worse,
You can't break a broken soul,
Warm heart that's turned cold.

Here it comes again,
That familiar feeling,
Almost taste like hate,
Live in my own strange way,
Like being stuck in the dark,
'Cause I'm never there to see it fall apart.

On the long road finding,
Means to an end,
Here we fucking go again.

Believing left me empty handed
Stuck with a heavy heart,
Unraveled and fucking broken,

Dazed in the past
Forced to die alone,
I'm headed downhill fast,
To parts unknown."

Bringer of Light,Entombed,anger,"Listen,
No-one knows.
True evil never shows.
You cannot
See its face.
True evil travels without trace.

No, it never dies.
Always on the rise.
Evil this good need no disguise.

Shit-caked.
Moral slide.
Soul-sized token entry side.

No, it never dies.
A modern hell is an enterprise.

At the head of all tables,
Bringer of light.
Here I am.
I'm your man.
I will kill you if I must,
I will help you if I can.

I'm your man.
At the head of all tables,
Bringer of light.
Here I am.
I'm your man.
I will help you if I must,
I will kill you if I can.

It's a cosmic gag reel,
Life turning on itself.
Cathedral-sized egos,
Empty top shelves.

The rules are set in opposition.
It's the goof of all times.
Schoolgirls selling sex at intermission.
It's ok, it's not a crime.

I give you pleasure,
Fulfill every need.
I take the bricks out of the briefcase.
I set this whole thing free.

I am your man.

At the head of all tables,
Bringer of light.
Here I am.
I'm your man.
I will kill you if I must,
I will help you if I can.

Womb Envy,Paint It Black,anger,"Too quick to step up with the
Fisticuffs. I think it's time
That someone called our
Bluff. We can't create so we
Denigrate. We don't know how
To love so we settle for
Hate. And we're running out
Of time. So let's step out of
Line, and resist the roles
That we've been assigned. I'm
Not going to settle for ""nice
Guys finish last,"" or treat
Our sisters as second class.
While we conquer and earn,
Slash and burn. Concrete,
Steel and pavement everywhere
I turn. And we're running out
Of time. Brothers & sisters,
Here's my decision: Fuck
Competition; turn my back on
Division. Did we learn the
Difference between ""want,""
And ""need?"" Can we be the
Soil if this song is the seed?"
Midas Touch,The Red Chord,anger,"Once it starts it wont stop.
Temper, Temper.
Here that sound? That's reality coming down.
I would have said so already if I could think of worse words.
Prepare for war.
You are over run.
This is our house.
I'll be a kid all that I want.
Grow the fuck up.
That's what were told.
Sinking down to.
Watch it gold man.
Start the reckon collect your teeth.
Go have them bronzed.
Let me tell you something about the way you think.
Your wrong plain and simple.
And I'd break my legs if I tried to sink down to your level.
Be careful you might get what you wish for.
You don't think I know where you came from.
You don't think I know.
You want to live and die by the sword.
Be careful what you wish for.
You don't think I know where you came from.
Go have them bronzed to remember.
I'll try to put it in terms that you can understand.
The way you think is so fucking stupid.
I'll try to comprehend.
Just try it.
Break my legs.
Eat my arms.
This is our house.
On the attack.
You're over run.
It never ends."
Objection Overruled,Exodus,anger,"All rise and come to order
Bailiff start the video recorder
You've been sworn, what's your complaint?
Speak up son, don't hesitate!
He presided in his courtroom so long ago
He was hanging cowboys for stealing buffalo
Court is adjourned, for his honor's feeling ill
The shaking old relic needs a glycerin pill!

Hang up your rope 'cause you're looking tired
If it was up to me they'd all be fired
Day after day convicting all those liars
This ain't TV jail
It's TV hell!

Believe it or not
Those walking blood clots
Make enough money for a thousand foot yacht
Who in Hollywood
Did they every acquit?
Just senile, judicial idiots
As the drama unfolds
And the law he upholds
If you look real close
You could see him growing mold
Small claims messiah
Is only a pariah to be ridiculed...
Objection Overruled!

All rise as he takes the bench
To hear his old voice make my gut wrench
Silence to those who are in his court
I'm found guilty by his report
No washed-up judge can say to me
The shit he throws arround when he's on TV
What can he fucking do, throw me in jail?
I'd slap out his dentures, post them for bail!

Hang up your robe 'cause you're looking tired
If it was up to me they'd all be fired
Day after day convicting all those liars
This ain't TV jail, it's TV hell!

You lose the case
To a bigger bullshit they you today
When it comes to the end
You tell all of TV land what you've got to say
When you're dead and gone
Will they get another fossil to carry on?
They must go to school
To hand-pick these old fools
I say to you
Objection Overruled!
It's all Perry Mason's fault!
Cat strangling"
Hammer,Diablo,anger,"I don't remember last night
Did I past out or did I get into a fight
Well, now it's just you and me
And I would love to take you for a ride
It's like a shot right between the eyes

I'm so sick and tired of your face
They remind that everything
Has gone insane
That is exactly how I feel
So come on, let me entertain you
Until your voice is dead

Say your prayers little one
The end has now begun
And I waste no time at all
'Cos here we stand or fall

It's time for the hammer to fall

Forward march to the point of no return
Can you feel the sound of war?

I've got nothing to lose
So you can just sit back and watch yourself
Becoming number two
I will treat you like a dog
Don't you know bad things come quick
So this shouldn't take too long"
Trash,Silverchair,anger,"One, two, three, four!

Welcome! Nothing short of anarchy
It's so hard to find out who you wanna be
Welcome! Nothing short of anarchy
It's so hard to find out who you wanna be - oh!

Go!

I couldn't find what you needed - ooh to be a double
A big pill but you know that you need a poison
Open, you need it but I returned the point of acceptance
How brave, your parades never do much

Violence!
Hopeless fight!
Call it straight!

Big black steel cap dealt rejection

Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Yay
Ugggh!"
Eureka Pile,Ministry,anger,"I seem to find myself each time I run away
Don't give me vivid in some yester body (selling) days?
Sometimes they reappear just like the sands of time
Or d'ya like some quick sand baby running off my summer wine

Same faces broken homes
Those memories have fled
All tears within me now are dormant or dead
My veins are bursting with a thirst that you cannot ignore

Alright Eureka's Pile
Now my saviour, or my whore

There's a lot that they don't mind when things aren't what they seem
I always wake up baby cos I always wake up me
My life may ain't come to much
Ignore my history

Least my Eureka Pile can see some way I feel
Ain't the way I see (* 2)

My Eureka Pile and me."
Awaiting the Winter Frost,Sentenced,anger,"A gathering in the cold, in the North, in the dark lands of Pohjola
Where the sun had not been crossing the sky nor seen for centuries...

We were brought together by oaths we had once sworn - by blood...
...once together drawn...

We had gathered all our forces
Called together all the heroes
Equipped a hundred swordsmen
And a thousand men with crossbows

Strengthened by hate and the thirst for the enemies' blood
We lay in wait for the season of no light
We had seen the frozen mist - we weren't afraid to die
And the oaths we had sworn gave a reason to live on

A Calm before the Storm
(We were) Awaiting the Winter Frost

...And then a storm arose in fury
The sky was shattered by lightning...

Awaiting the Winter Frost
As the sky blackened and the stars turned red
The frost greeted us with a cold northern breeze
Off with their heads! Off with their fuckin' heads!
Oh, the time had come...
To slaughter the hordes of cowardice
And cleanse the North from lies

We had gathered all our forces
Called together all the heroes
Equipped a hundred swordsmen
And a thousand men with crossbows

We raised our swords
Grasped the irons
Lifted our bows
And chose the arrows

The false ones' hordes were put to the sword
The strong and the weak, one by one...
Their race was slaughtered to the very last man
Our bloodfend was done as their bodies reddened the land

Awaiting the Winter Frost
The reign of the dark and the cold
The spell of pure hate

Awaiting the Winter Frost

And the heathen peace was found"
Judas,The Agony Scene,anger,"They shut their eyes now that night has fallen
And pray the wolves are kept at bay
For now the mist hangs, arms wide open
Like some cruel depiction of Christ

For now the silence comforts lost souls
Who in this moment hang gracefully
By the dead, hidden by shadows
Who've come to take them in their sleep

Falling farther in darkness
Falling farther in darkness

Eyes wide lacking comprehension
As silhouettes dance in the flames
Their limbs bound by the shadows
That seem to stare back from the pits of black

For now the silence comforts lost souls
Who in this moment hang gracefully
By the dead, hidden by shadows
Who's screams echo for eternity

Falling farther in darkness
Falling farther in darkness
Falling farther in darkness
Falling farther in darkness

Awakened by their screams
Like something of a nightmare
Lacking the desire to breathe
Wishing for the end

Awakened by their screams
Like something of a nightmare
Lacking the desire to breathe
Wishing for the end

Wishing for the end
Wishing for the end
Wishing for the end
Wishing for the end

They shut their eyes now that night has fallen
And pray the wolves are kept at bay
For now the mist hangs, arms wide open
Like some cruel depiction of Christ

For now the silence comforts lost souls
Who in this moment hang gracefully
By the dead, hidden by shadows
Who've come to take them in their sleep

Falling farther in darkness
Falling farther in darkness
Falling farther in darkness
Falling farther"
Tobacco Road,Eric Burdon,anger,"Oh, I was born in a dump
My mama died, daddy got drunk
He left me here to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road

I grew up in a rusty shack
And all I owned was hangin' on my back
The Lord knows how I loathe
This place called, Tobacco Road

But it's home, it's really my home
The only life I'll ever know
But the Lord knows I loathe
Tobacco Road

I'm gonna leave and get a job
With the help and the grace of God
I save my money, get rich I know
Bring it back to Tobacco Road

Well, well, well
Gonna bring me some dynamite, gonna bring me a crane
Got to blow you up, got to tear you down, start all over again
I'll rebuild the town, I'll be proud to show
And keep the name of Tobacco Road

But it's home, it's home
The only life that I've ever known
I despise you 'cause you're filthy
But I love you because you're my home

Tobacco Road, Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road, Tobacco Road
Say you're dirty and filthy
I despise, I despise you 'cause you're filthy
But I love you because you're my home

Tobacco Road, road
Talkin' about a dirty, funky, filthy low down place
Tobacco Road, well, you're so dirty and filthy"
Lines of Suicide,The Agony Scene,anger,"My heartstrings cease to strain
I've acquired a taste for poisoned lips
Drank deep of this disease in me
Adored with prying eyes
Beneath a mask made of flesh and thorns

Collected from the ones she'd loved before
Collected from the ones she'd loved before
Collected from the ones she'd loved before
Collected from the ones she'd loved before

My heartstrings cease to strain
I've acquired a taste for poisoned lips
Drank deep of this disease in me
Adored with prying eyes
Beneath a mask made of flesh and thorns

Her eyes were opened wide
She now could see forever
Traced deep the marks she'd made
With her razor

I go to war with anybody motherfucker, I'm a sorcerer ock
I'm fucking everything whether the bitch is gorgeous or not
I murder everything, that's just some of my torturous plot

I'm A Cloud,Boy Hits Car,anger,"And you will heal yourself
When the rain begins to fall
Feel the fire
Burning inside us all
Remove me
For going in unchained
Blow away for yourself and gather again
And, listen to the conversations of the sea
Inside us all
There's a quiet beach
If we fall into ourselves we will become free
I myself could use a little clarity
'Cause I am so full of love
I am so full of hate
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way
I am so full of you
I am so full of me
I am so full of these words
That don't tell her a fucking thing
I am so full of love
I am so full of hate
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way
Then I opened up my mouth
I'm a cloud.
And these words they seldom come out
When I looked into her eyes I cared enough to wonder why
She'd want a cloud that's floating around
But I feel it's time to say goodbye to fear
And feel the fury of these tears
As they run down my face
I can feel her so far away
'Cause I am a cloud
And I am so afraid
So don't you come and gather at me in this haze
I sit at home and feel the sun's daze
As she gently melts a little everyday
I blow away remaining unphased
When I feel the there's something crawling out of me
I'm just a cloud watching the moon rise
These motherfuckers stepped on me,
And tried to fuck me from behind
'Cause I am a cloud
And I am so afraid
I, I am
So full of love
I am so full of love
I am so full of hate

Ayo, I just want the whole world to know
That I did not start this, but I will finish it

Comin' up, it never mattered what color you was

If you could spit, then you could spit

That's it, that's what it was
Back when motherfuckers was straight backpackin'
Cipherin', fightin' for life in this rap
For the mic to get passed, and you psyched and you gassed
Then you hype, 'cause you last
And you might whoop some ass; if you lost, then you lost
Shake hands like a man and you swallowed it
When the Unsigned Hype column in
The Source was like our only source of light
When the mics used to mean somethin', a four was like
You were the shit, now it's like the least you get
Three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
Four and a half or five means you're Biggie, Jigga, Nas
Or Benzino—shit, I don't even think you realize
You're playin' with motherfuckers' lives
I done watched Dre get fucked on The Chronic
Probably 'cause I was on it
Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin' breath to get a five
Shit, I was right, I'da fuckin' died already tryin'
I swear to God, I never lie, I bet that's why
You let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit, we knew
You'd probably try and fuck us with Obie and 50 too
Fuck a relationship! We through!

So, listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This old G's about to get smoked like rolled weed
You don't know me or my motherfuckin' mother
You motherfuckin' punk!
Put me on your fuckin' cover just to sell your little sell-out mag
I ain't mad, I feel bad, here's an ad
Here's a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit
That you don't know about, yeah?
Let's talk about how you're puttin' your own son out there

To try to eat off him because you missed your boat
You're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old

No wonder you're sore now, lordy, you're bored now
I'm pushin' 30, you're kickin' 40's door down
Bitch, this is war now, and you'll never beat me
All you do is cheat me out of Quotables
But you know that you'll always see me on your TV
'Cause you've got to stay up 'til three in the morning
To see your video played once on BET
So, hee hee hee, who has the last laugh? Aftermath, yeah
So, on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks

We'll never fold or hold back
Just know that Benzino's wack;
No matter how many times I say his name, he'll never blow, jack

You're better off tryin' to bring RSO back

Look at your track record, that's how far it goes back
It's extortion, and Ray owns a portion
So, half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from Boston
Bullyin' and bossin' Dave like a slave

They completely brainwashed him and forced him to stay
Locked in his own office
Afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in New York
And it's pitiful, 'cause I would have never said shit if you'd
Have kept your mouth shut, bitch, now what?
Hit it, Clue! Spit it, Slay! New shit, exclusive
Yo, Lantern, yo Whoo Kid
You know what to do with this
Use it, I'm through, this is stupid
I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this

It ain't no race
I'ma hit the top
Just when I want to
And it's a matter of time
And I'm gonna
Cause I know when to
Go 'head enter
The classic Moe Dee rap
That sent ya
Runnin' around
Holdin' ya head
Askin' ya homeboy
Yo man
You hear what he said
Another funky rhythm
Look at ya man
And give him a high five
Cause I'm live
Runnin' around with him
Telling everybody
Hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up
And check the clock
Punch it
I go to work
I go to work
I go to work
Like an architect
I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word
With each letter it becomes visibly better
Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vaction
I came to roam
The land I own
And stand alone on the microphone
Daddy's home
Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace
Start the race
I'm coming in first
With each verse
I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I got ya
I have to slap ya
Senseless with
Endless rhymes don't pretned this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done
Your mind will become
So trapped in the rap
You'll lust on another one
You gotta wait it takes time
I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect
And it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one
I go to work
I go to work
I go to work
Like a boxer
Train the brain and aim
To out fox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya
So hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks
So power packed
Before you can react
You're flat on your back
Down for the count
Get up and dismount
Cause I'm coming
With an endless amount
Of words in a hurry
Like a flurry
A collage to camouflage
The power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote
I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote
Rhymes at a level
So you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent
So stay awake
Sleepwalkers
Slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil
Rhymes in its highest form
I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up
A few casualties but so what
If you're slow
You blow
You know you go
I flow
I throw all pro
I go to work
I go to work
To say rap is not work
Is ludicrous
Whoever said it
Must be new to this
When you hear me
You'll compare me
To a prophet for profit
Not merely
Putting words together for
Recreation
Each rhyme's a dissertation
You want to know my occupation
I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work
I go to work
I go to work"

Now I see that it ain't no us
Baby, to me that's a definite plus
If I can't get you out of the streets
Then you don't need to be with me

Do you love me like you say
Then maybe you could get away
From the life of doing the wrong things
You promised
Don't make me read about it baby
Think of me before I'm gone

Breaking the Back,Million Dead,anger,"On leaving school immersed in philanthropic notions
(Of a kind these days I find unthinkable)
I pulled my frail frame onto my charger and rode off into a sunset
With agenda predictable.

Fresh faced - young dumb and tragically convinced that
Blind faith could make an infantile, normative
Playground theory on social interaction
Positive enough to show them all, but alas!

Working the tills put hair on my chest,
Telesales made me a man! x2

And everything was going to be ok, but
The making of the man was the breaking of the back upon the rock
Of everyday hostility.

And I don't mean to seem at all ungrateful, but
The air-conditioned life has left me gasping for some real conversation.

And just because
Turing couldn't possibly conceive a machine with this little personality
I'm working shifts in veal-fattening pens,
And yet I'm puppy thin because to tell the truth I've been hanging on
For something more than distant dial tones
And a sense of ending.

The breaking of the back was the making of the man x4."

Leave the world behind

Believe in a new way to separate
Your ultimate sacrifice is your ultimate sin
I must bring myself to hell
To know what heaven is
I must go to extremities
The death extremities
Believe in my way because I'm pure
Your ultimate is your ultimate sin
Believe in a new way to separate
Your ultimate sacrifice is your ultimate sin
Crucify your beliefs and make contribution
Crucify your beliefs for the sake of redemption
Crucify your beliefs for the great contradiction
Crucify your beliefs and save your own skin

World Destruction,Time Zone,anger,"Speak about destruction. (x3)

This is a world destruction, your life ain't nothing.
The human race is becoming a disgrace.
Countries are fighting with chemical warfare.
Not giving a damn about the people who live.
Nostradamus predicts the coming of the Antichrist.
Hey, look out, the third world nations are on the rise.
The Democratic-Communist Relationship,
Won't stand in the way of the Islamic force.
The CIA is looking for you.
The KGB is smarter than you think.
Brainwash mentalities to control the system.
Using TV and movies - religions of course.
Yes, the world is headed for destruction.
Is it a nuclear war?
What are you asking for?

This is a world destruction. Your life ain't nothing.
The human race is becoming a disgrace.
The rich get richer.
The poor are getting poorer.
Fascist, chauvinistic government fools.
People, Moslems, Christians and Hindus.
Are in a time zone just searching for the truth.
Who are you to think you're a superior race?
Facing forth your everlasting doom.
We are Time Zone. We've come to drop a bomb on you.
World destruction, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom!

This is the world destruction, your life ain't nothing.
The human race is becoming a disgrace.
Nationalities are fighting with each other.
Why is this? Because the system tells you.
Putting people in faceless categories.
Knowledge isn't what it used to be.
Military tactics to control a nation.
Who wants to be a president or king? Me!
Mother Nature is gonna work against you.
Nothing in your power that you can do.
Yes, the world is headed for destruction.
You and I know it, cause the Bible tells you.
If we don't start to look for a better life,
The world will be destroyed in a time zone!

Speak about destruction. (x3)"

Coming out the mother fucking crevices
Coming out the fucking cracks like snakes boy
Word to mother
All my niggas in Queens and ya dont stop
All my niggas in Brooklyn and ya dont stop
All my niggas Uptown and ya dont stop
All my niggas in the boogiewoogie and ya won't stop
We gonna set this shit New York style

We don't throw gang signs in New York
We just be on some shit in New York
New York City, shiftee low down gritty
You punk niggas yell pity and smell shitty
NYPD can suck my dick
This is the way we rip shit from the bricks
Walking like a zombie smoking blunts in the lobby
I be rollin with more niggas behind me than Khadafi

Attention, fuck all that slippin and itchin
I'm rappin, loot snachin, stayin greasy this shit ain't easy
I'm comin rawhide, serious as a four five
Them damn streets are eager to claim all lives
But fuck it, it's my home hate it or appreciate it
It's the torrid 8 million story orientated
Designated and made for the real renegades
So I never been afraid to stomp, comp, then get paid

This is the way we walk in New York
This is the way we walk in New York
This is the way we walk in New York
This is the way we walk in New York

I'ma stay on my job, cause that's my adventure
I was bred to be a big gainer who contained a precent of the
U.S.G. which make me switch like a schizo
Where I roam it gets so hot but never blow my cool at no spot
If the heat got too much I'ma slide down south
Outta town bound, either home or away
New York hold shit down on keep locked we rock all night
And if Zoo York niggas wasn't part of your shit, your shit wasn't right
We known to start shit up from trends, to riots, to fracas
And big enough to fuck up anybody that wanna attack us
And that's cause the five boroughs are deep
Most of us are peeps, true Zoo York niggas we play for keeps

(Wanna be a part of it--New york is always starting shit)

Fuck that, I'm the nasty native New Yorker
The full of shit talker
The dark street walker
Sign of the time stalker
Bringin it back to reality, this is for my niggas in NYC

Not since '76

Since the Knicks won the championships
Has there been some more shit like this
So back up, get off of that soft or wack rap style
My shots ring loud, and panic the crowd
Blowin' up
Get up, my sounds downtown
Hold 'em up
Give me everything right now
So fuck the mayor, fuck Rudy, Ray, and the governor
Ya'll niggas couldn't walk my walk, my talk's ruggeder

This is the way we walk in New York
This is the way we walk in New York
This is the way we walk in New York
This is the way

Yeah, I'm from the place where criminals is born
And Sticky Fingaz ain't never led a nigga wrong
Representin New York City and for what it's worth
Yo we the triflest mother fuckers on the face of this Earth
So if you don't like your life fuck with a nigga from New York
The instincts we got is to shoot first then talk
But what seems to always gives us away is our ""niggery"" walk
And I speak from experience, so pleader take heed to advice
We sellin guns and drugs and sex or anything for the right price
The crime rate's so goddamn high, we had to name the shit twice
Cause tourists be scared to death to visit the criminal's paradise
Home of bloodshed and tears and for souvenirs there's fears
It appears nobody cares so say your prayers
Or you gonna get double crossed and set up, either head up or shut up
Cause bullets ain't got no names and anybody could get wet up
And end up on the front page of the Daily News papers
But while crooks dressed in Brooks and behind desks in skyscrapers
And I never bought no shit, but then I never took no shit
I'm a kleptomaniac, I think I got a fuckin' habit
So lick shot to all the boroughs and ghettos across the nation
Other states who could relate get bullet proof appreciation
Cause

This is the way we walk in New York

No more paradise, no more soothing rain
All the sacrifice, the pain is all the same
Still I'm pushing onward, alone I can't deny
My presence fills the desert, my spirit never dies
Will these lonely nights ever end?
Will I live to see my journey's end?
As the world awakens me so hard, my values have been changed
I make a promise to myself: Never again
A dusty godforsaken path, endless to my dismay
I know these are the badlands, somehow I'll find my way
The vultures that circle, cloud the empty sky,
Patiently waiting, they wait for me to die
Tortured and beaten, blistered by the sun
Forceful and heartless, have the badlands won?
Still I'm pushing onward, alone I can't deny
My presence fills the desert, my spirit never dies
As the world awakens me so hard, my values have been changed

You row upstream, the water still makes waves
That carry the rest of us away.

You are what you weep,
From your head down to the sleet.
Fell, tripped up the stairs to the place
Void in all hints of home.
Watch with your heart, run with your gut,
Ever so careful not to lose
The fragile beauties of motivation.
A whir of warning winds signal me back to birth.

Watch with your heart, run with your gut,
Ever so careful not to lose your mold.
They laughed to all the intrusive music,
They danced hard enough
To wake from a non fiction-based nap,
They killed me
When I couldn't be a source of entertainment,
Strung like a puppet to every degree of debt
In social contribution by the migraine.
Our fight keeps using a voice
That needs rekindling.
I promised wet weather to myself
From the moment I set foot into my own autopsy.
Past all the shimmer,
Beyond the urine-stenched conglomerates
Of those without a set of eyes
To make contact with.

There is but the utter of all necessaries,
Pushing ones that brimming light
Through the dregs of apartment life,
A necessity that
Leaves me short of breath in the end.
Watch with your heart, run with your gut.
Primate winds blow me back to old bloodstreams."

My devil could care attitute, you know, I just can't seem to find
And once upon a time, I never minded very much
I never let it knock me down or grind me out of touch

Full of dreams and schemes it seems they just do not exist
And once I told myself, he will not be missed

Soon I'll show you what I mean 'cause...

I don't need for you to rescue me
From what you believe is tearin' me apart
You'll never know how it feels to be like me (fuck you)
I relieve you of the duty that you gave to yourself

Face down in your own shit, you look up at me
In your eyes there's something like pity for me
Reach up from the bottom, lend a helpless hand
You volunteer to be my true savior
You can't help me but if you wanted to
I would show you what I need 'cause...

I don't need for you to rescue me
From what you believe is tearin' me apart
You'll never know till you see what I see (fuck you)
I remind you of the damage that you did to yourself

Face down

Just move, you never were there when I needed you
Face down in your own shit, you look up at me
You can't help me

I don't need for you to rescue me
From what you believe is tearin' me apart
You'll never know how it feels to be like me (fuck you)

Spit into this life and thrown in this cage

After all that we've said
After all that we've done
After all that we fight for
They said that we were worthless

Punch in and punch out, give up and give out
Weary and broken, got no choice
Shackled and chained, to lives mundane
And die with nothing to show for it

After all that we've said
After all that we've done
After all that we fight for
They said that we were worthless"

Cold fingers, gold fingers
In a cold sweat

I remember a day
We'd go for a ride in the country
And you'd say, ""Sing it, boy
Do it again, do it again""

Happy Camper (carpe B.U.M.),Strapping Young Lad,anger,"You pretentious fucking losers
You've got nothing at all
You've got your fingers in your asshole
And your hand on the call
And you talk such fucking horseshit
That it's hard to believe
That you almost make careers out of being naive

You, you are a fucker 'cause you sold my guitar
You, you are a fucker, seeking fortune in bars
You, you are a fucker, 'cause you say such stupid shit
I've got a better line in pocket lint
That what you've done with it

So if you are an asshole who pretends to be a friend
Then get your ass in music, you'll be set to the end, ending
And now you've got the nerve to ask me about my temper?
Why yes, I have become a fucking happy camper!

I hate your fucking faces and your trendy cut hair
I hate the fact you think your job will go anywhere
Because its use is just the same as what I shit into the bowl
Just like the mess between your ears is like the mess in my hole
I hate your loser friends who only come out when it's right
I hate that when it's down you run instead of fight

I'm set to think your lot in life to test the stronger ones
Will just require some chicken shit and also sneakers for the run
I dig it away, the shit you puked instead of swallowed
In an attempt to try and find the dick instead of the load
So when you move and stand aside my mood will hamper
And yes, I will become a fucking happy camper!

Stuck in endless winter with your press to keep you sane
Wait for useless numbers to grow useful once again
Where the heat will come again, your flaw grows sick
Your flaw will send, the shit you call your business
To the place that is your end
Stuck in the winter, cold and wet
Your stupid friends have come and went
And you're left behind with your idiot job
And it's far from a prize, you fucking dink
... you're a fucking dink... yeah!
...how's this for punk? Dink!
...suck my cock, you pathetic excuse for a human being

... you're a neurotic, homophobic, racist dork... You've also got a lot of balls to dick with someone else's life, you fucking pseudo ghetto ""boy in the hood"" middle class white spoiled rotten bored ""gangsta"" wanna-be hunk of regenerated red neck bullshit! Thank Christ you don't have to rely on that staggering intellect or dynamic personality to intimidate others, shit for brains. Shut the fuck up, and get out of your parents' house and get a real job, you putz, and for god's sake, quit being such a fucking sheep! Now grow the hell up!
...dink

I let it get me down because you're in it for the glory
And I'd rather leave with reason than go dying for a story
And this whole L.A. Rock thing
That the malls are buying up
It doesn't work, it doesn't work
It's so inbred I might throw up...

And now I'm put into the middle
With the contracts and the bunk, and I always end up
Hearing, ""hey, man, punk... Let's have more punk!""
So here I am to do a favour, save some hassle kiss and tell
That either way my music's shit and it ain't ever going to sell
So if you've got the gall to take this shit blown up your ass
And you've got the cash and balls to pump the same crap out in mass
Then hell, I'll stand aside and with your plans I'll never tamper
I'll sit and write you songs and be a fucking happy camper

Yeah, send me out a contract and in clauses you will lurk
The smaller points so I can give it all and save you work
You say an album's not an album without issues left to hamper...
Well then, fuck

Of all the wants and hungers
The lust of love, a brute desire
The ledge of life goes under

Divide the dream into the flesh
Kaleidoscope and candle eyes
Empty winds scrape on the soul
But never stop to realize

Animal whisperings
Intoxicate the night
Hypnotize the desperate
Slow motion light

Wash away into the rain
Blood, milk and sky
Hollow moons illuminate
And beauty never dies

Running wild, running blind
I breathe the body deep
1, 000 years beside myself
I do not sleep

Seduce the world
It never screams
Dead water lies
Ride the only one who knows
Beauty never dies"

Tune in next week.
Nail biting, creature feature.
You bought the seat but all you need is the edge.
Watch out.
It can swallow you whole.
So is this where it ends or where it begins.
Doc, I've got a fever.
Why wont you tell it to me straight? Every strike deadly.
Tell me how bad it is.
Will you amputate? I will never be what you stand for.
Fighting for what is right.
I wont let it be freed.
Is this where it ends or it begins? You decide.
DO you want to take it on?
If I'm so bad then why don't you fucking do it?
I will never end it.
You were changing things just for the sake of change.
I wont let it bring me to my knees.
And if it with my dying breath, I will never give in to this.

It all unfolds to me
I walk down through my mind
And feel a bittercold fear
What mankind did with pretence
Of religion and belief

Away is the sun
Endless the night
Mankind's massacra
Intelligence is dead

There have been satanic rites
In blood, inverted crosses
Expulsion of all mortals
The ""good"" side isn't better
Holy inquisitors on arbitrary command
Through all blasphemic centuries

Destruction and hate
Sewage of faith
Ignorant souls
The decline goes on
Man will never learn
That religion's created by man"

Until those maggots began to drop

Bathed in maggots till the planet shift

Flash of fear when he sees my sword

Leave a little booger underneath his throne

For I Am Cursed,Youth Code,anger,"Pen to paper with invisible ink
Displaying honesty with nothing to show
Recanting the taste of the knife
A sweet to bury me forever
We're trapped in casings made of arsenic and inclinations
Indigence from the heart trudging on so unfulfilled

I haven't been so much as thrilled to be alive
For I am cursed and holding on
To this semblance of a life

I cannot shake
The jinx that's applied
The haunts that encroach
A rain that won't dry
I'm drinking my options
And dying of thirst
The shadows still lingering
For I am cursed
The lights have been dim lit
The candles burned wet
No shelter to house this
A plague that cant set
A scratch at this ulcer
A prayer that it bursts
A longing for solace
For I am cursed

Mouth to bottle with a hunger for regret
Paralyzed in an infant state
Our feelings benumbed by our consumptions
Every kiss a coat to peel and flake
Habituation a crutch which once brought solace
Now choleric as there is no other choice
Cauterize the wounds which exposures
Smoldering ache which begat the vice

I've never felt such vapid space behind my eyes
For I am cursed and moving past
The orchestrator of these cries

I cannot shake
The jinx that's applied
The haunts that encroach
A rain that won't dry
I'm drinking my options
And dying of thirst
The shadows still lingering
For I am cursed
The lights have been dim lit
The candles burned wet
No shelter to house this
A plague that cant set
A scratch at this ulcer
A prayer that it bursts

Just lay me on this bed and give me some head

Got the cam cord layin' in the drawer where he can't see
He can't wait to show my girls, he sucked the piss out my pussy
Been doin' this for years, no need to practice
Take lessons from the queen and you'll know how to mack this

Cum all on his pants, I met him at the studio
He showed up with his homeboy named Julio

I said, ""Wow, who's the other guy?""
Hope you know you paying extra for this fuckin' third eye
Something about him
I knew he was a phony
Put the burner in his mouth
Fool, give me my money

He was just a nigga frontin' like he knew mad stars
In his homeboy's whips like he got mad cars
Niggas ain't shit but they still can trick
All they can do for me is suck my clit

A bottle and my inside is about to rot. I'm working to inflict some pain.
Bloodstain! In front of me you stand trial. Come to me my child.

And no one can hear me cry. I'm the rest of your life. And sadly I stand trial.
Come to me my child.

I'm trapped between the demons, have to get away from the darkest season.
Wiping the sweat off my forehead seconds before his eyes turn into red. I'm
Looking for another location, simply running into desperation. Nothing changes
I've lost my faith. Why did I have to grow up in hate?

Feels like a living insanity. I am the dark reality. Something is pulling me
Down. I capture all the hate around. Moving in different corners. I make you
Feel worthless. It feels like I'm on trial. Come to me my child."

Broken,Digital Summer,anger,"I'd give you the world
If it would mean anything
Despite your reaction
I can't help but believe
That maybe inside
You feel the same
I'm killed by the question
That surrounds your name
(Do you feel the way I do?)
So break my wings and watch me fall
Cause I'm broken
When I look at you
And if I cut myself would you bleed too
Would you feel everything I do
Would you feel the way I do
I'm falling apart
It's like so hard to see
I didn't give you my heart
You just took it from me
This feeling of anger
It just won't go away
I'd give anything
Just to hear you say
(Do you feel the way I do?)
So break my wings and watch me fall
Cause I'm broken
When I look at you
And if I cut myself would you bleed too
Would you feel everything I do
Would you feel the way I do
Can you feel it inside yourself
What would you feel
Would you feel it in your heart
Can you feel this inside
The pain that won't go away
So break my wings and watch me fall
I'm broken
When I look at you
And if I cut myself would you bleed too
Would you feel everything I do
Would you feel the way I do

Fever,The Hives,anger,"I just stopped listening to your story.
As if I paid attention once.
And I never once felt more alive, alive, alive - ALIVE.

Speeding up the pace on the machine.
Calling radio and magazines.
Preaching to the ordinary ones.
Yes Teaching all the ordinary ones.
It gives me fever.

I just stopped listening to your story.
And I'll start forgetting all at once.
And I never once felt more alive, alive, alive - ALIVE.

Speeding up the pace on the machine.
Calling radio and magazines.
Hate my job can't wait to cut the chain.
I love speaking to slow and the insane.
It gives me fever.

I just stopped listening to your story.
And I'll turn the tables all at once.

Speeding up the pace on the machine.
Calling radio and magazines.
My clock is ticking fast upon my wrist.
I wanna slow it down so I'll put it on my fist.

Guilt by Association,Grendel,anger,"The verdict's spoken
No turning back, no better way
The truth is broken
No listening ear for you or me
The victims taken
Within the havoc that we see
It's not the heartbeat
It's what goes on inside of here

I'd take you down
Down into tears
To see your own
Controlled disease

Caught in delusion
This mass confusion
Left, right, the spectrum burns
Our lives they lie in flames
Caught in delusion
Cut-throat conclusions
Left, right, the splinters march
As we all burn in flames

A life is broken
Nothing but black, no sight is found
The truth is hopeless
No helping hand, no dying ground
A narrow vision
Decide for us, deny the strife
The anger burning
No wish for this, this isn't life

Believe this
It could be you, it could be me
Believe this
Even hell is sometimes a release
Believe this
It could be you, it could be me
Believe this
We cannot judge, we cannot see

Caught in delusion
This mass confusion
Left, right, the spectrum burns
Our lives lie in the flames
Caught in delusion
Cut-throat conclusions
Left, right, the splinters march
As we all burn in flames"

Margaret Freeman,The Residents,anger,"Margaret Freeman had a body
Unlike any I'd seen
It seemed to drip her mental thoughts
Like much too warm ice cream
One day while she washed the dishes
In the nude I saw
How her mother's sodden ways
Had rubbed her rib cage raw"
Car Fiction,Echobelly,anger,"In a taxi chasing for the sun,
All around us strangers everyone,
With no hope for what they hope for,
We could drive all of our tears away.

Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho.

In a taxi ride that ends too soon,
The city skyline tries to kick the moon,
We have no time for what they wait for,
We can drive all of our tears away.

Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho.

You and I against the walled in generation,
You and I could kick the walls away,
We have no time for what they wait for,
We can run fast we can run far.

Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho."
Once In A Lifetime,The Exies,anger,"And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house,
With a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself-well... how did I get here?

Letting my days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting my days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the moneys gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground.

And you may ask yourself
How do I work this?
And you may ask yourself
Where is that large automobile?
And you may tell yourself
This is not my beautiful house!
And you may tell yourself
This is not my beautiful wife!

Letting my days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting my days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the moneys gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground.

Same as it ever was... same as it ever was... same as it ever was...
Same as it ever was... same as it ever was... same as it ever was...
Same as it ever was... same as it ever was...

And you may ask yourself
What is that beautiful house?
And you may ask yourself
Where does that highway go to?
And you may ask yourself
Am I right or am I wrong?
And you may say to yourself
My god!... what have I done?

Letting my days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting my days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the moneys gone
Once in a lifetime..."
Coffin Text,Unwritten Law,anger,"There was a time when men would prosper
They saw a sign that would offer them the key
Immortality

The desert sand held a place of recourse
Their motivation driven by higher source
A higher source

They let them know there's something more

The writings on the wall tell us the story of it all
It makes no senses show me the key
The coffin text

The disbelievers came to conquer
The secrets lost in a buried desert tomb
They sealed the truth

As evolution at the pharaoh
Silenced the voice that cured all our sorrow
Oh, our sorrow

Silenced the voice that let us know

The writings on the wall tell us the story of it all
It makes no sense show me the key
The coffin text

Fighting, learning, saving, burning
Never know what is coming next
Lying, stealing, never healing
Safe to say we've all been hexed
It's in the coffin text

Coffin text
Coffin text

Wasted Words,Death By Stereo,anger,"Now, now flow

Follow sheep and move along
Come on kids let's sing along
Do you realize what I'm saying?
Do you believe a word I sing?

Here's the proof just look around
The reality surrounds me
And I can see it in your eyes
Well, I can see you're full of, full of lies

All these wasted words
I spill my guts for you
We lay it all on the line
We do it night after night

Ideas go unheard
With every breath I spew
We lay it all on the line
We do it night after night
We lay it all, we lay it all

With every word it makes me sick
I hope they hit you like a ton of bricks
And the reality surrounds you
Open up your eyes can't you see the lies?

Religion, the hatred, the money they're making
Take your life back then you'll fight back
When you see the wrong
Then you'll be the song

All these wasted words
I spill my guts for you
We lay it all on the line
We do it night after night

Ideas go unheard
With every breath I spew
We lay it all on the line
We do it night after night

All these wasted words
I spill my guts for you
We lay it all on the line
We do it night after night

Ideas go unheard
With every breath I spew
We lay it all on the line
We do it night after night

We lay it all on the line
We do it night after night
We lay it all, we lay it all
We lay it all, we lay it all"

Hand That Holds True,Taproot,anger,"The manic stage,
A scary phase
Feeding all I know,
A cloudy haze,
The hectic pace,
Strips me of my throne,
It seems there is nothing but you,
To please in this world around you,
And in this place,
In my domain you're always in control;

Not the same without you like you really care;

I never thought you'd be the one to bring me down,
I never seem to hold onto a hand that holds true,
A never ending maze of crazy days have come an end,
(I find I'm reaching out again),
It doesn't have to be this way;

I lie awake,
Make no mistake
I'm so alone,
My body aches,
Nothing I take
Could fix me like your hold,
It seems there is nothing but you,
To please this withdrawal now from you,
And in this place in my domain you're always in control;

Not the same without you, like you're even there;

When I think about this loss too much,
It accumulates,
I realize just what i've done,
With my fate,
I've blown my chance for better days
Come back to me"
Captor of Sin,At the Gates,anger,"You hold high the banner of self-deceit
Encaged in the dogmas of life, you join the elite
[Chorus]
My judas-window stays shut shut forever more
My judas-window stays shut shut forever more
You mock the weak for not giving you their trust
In your world of make believe, where statues turn to dust
[Chorus]
You walk through what is me
Stare blind - cannot see
Your thoughts flee to a different land
They are free, but you are bound
Silenced forever, the walls are closing in
The keys to our damnation burial burial within
[Chorus]
Shut forever more"
Volume 4,Rollins Band,anger,"I spend time, searching my mind, walking blindly
I'm a live but I don't know why my thoughts threat me
Paranoia, fear and guilt, I hope I don't explode
I'm a bomb that ya can't diffuse,
a gun that ya can't unload.

I don't listen, I don't know, man: I don't care!
You're talking 'bout all the hell you've seen...
Man: I live there!
Talk to me and it goes right through
I never heard a word you said.
Save your breath 'coz it's no use:
You're talking to the living dead!

Ooh.bullet driven eyes... yeah, what can you tell me?
Ooh.I'm living in a nightmare, yeah!
I'm on the edge, shrinking back from the ledge
Looking out my window, down upon my heritage
Strip malls, thin walls, people paralyzed beneath the sun
Why me, why now?
I see the dirty millions and I try to survive somehow...

Got no reasons, got no needs
I hear gunshots, I hear screams
What can you do to me, what can you say?
I used to be alive but I threw it all away
I used to have problems, I used to live a lie
I've seen the sidewalk bleed
And I watched the mother cry
I used to have a mind, I used to wonder why
But now I go from day to day and wait around to die...
...like he did"

I tried to get so high

I made it ten miles high

I'm gonna get so high

My nightmare's everywhere but inside
A living indication of every situation
But it seems I have neglected complication
Hindered my salvation
But I try and I try and I try

I'm gonna get so high
You'll never get inside
I swore I'd never turn into you
I'm closer all the time

I made it ten miles high
Can't tell my truth from my lies
I swore to god I would never turn into you
I'm getting closer all the time

Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
